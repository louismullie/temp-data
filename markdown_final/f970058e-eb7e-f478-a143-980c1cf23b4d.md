## Question

What does a likely reactive adenopathy mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "likely reactive adenopathy" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal definition and histopathology. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where this phrase is commonly used. Next, I will review how clinicians distinguish reactive from malignant nodes. After that, I should consider special scenarios like HIV, autoimmune disease, and vaccine-related adenopathy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable definition and note when follow-up or biopsy is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the literal meaning. "Reactive adenopathy" literally means lymph node enlargement due to a non-neoplastic, immunologic response rather than malignancy, typically showing follicular hyperplasia with preserved architecture and no clonal lymphoproliferation on histology, which distinguishes it from lymphoma or metastatic disease.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical contexts where this phrase is used. Clinicians often label nodes as "likely reactive" when imaging or exam suggests benign features in settings such as localized infection, autoimmune disease flares, HIV-related persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or iatrogenic causes like recent vaccination, reserving biopsy for nodes with concerning features or persistence beyond a prudent interval [^116EJVzK] [^117EdsvW] [^116dCCqq] [^116yFxER].

> I need to check how we distinguish reactive from malignant nodes at the bedside. Features that increase suspicion for malignancy include size greater than 2 cm, hard or fixed consistency, supraclavicular location, lack of tenderness, generalized distribution, and systemic B symptoms; conversely, nodes under 1–2 cm, soft, mobile, tender, and localized to a draining site are more often reactive, though exceptions exist and clinical judgment is essential [^116EJVzK] [^113hHaki].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Imaging can refine probability but is not definitive. Ultrasound features such as a preserved fatty hilum, central vascularity, and homogeneous echotexture favor reactive nodes, whereas cortical thickening greater than about 5–6 mm, focal cortical lobulation, peripheral vascularity, and loss of the hilum raise concern for malignancy; in vaccine-related axillary adenopathy, ipsilateral nodes within 2–4 weeks of injection are typically managed with short-interval follow-up rather than biopsy when morphology is reassuring [^114fzP57] [^116yFxER] [^116dCCqq].

> Let me consider HIV specifically. Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy is common in untreated HIV and reflects reactive follicular hyperplasia; FDG-PET avidity correlates with viral load and can mimic lymphoma, so in aviremic patients PET metrics like TLG and SUV can help differentiate lymphoma from reactive nodes, whereas in viremic patients overlap is greater and clinical correlation is crucial [^117EdsvW] [^117Rz9ok] [^116YAGyp].

> I should double-check autoimmune contexts. In diseases like SLE, RA, and Sjögren syndrome, lymphadenopathy is frequent and often reflects disease activity with reactive follicular hyperplasia; however, these patients have elevated lymphoma risk, so new or atypical nodes warrant careful evaluation rather than automatic reassurance [^115cDFwC] [^114w4sqo] [^116VZewi].

> But wait, what if the "reactive" label is being used after a nondiagnostic biopsy. I need to ensure I clarify that. Pathologists may report "reactive lymphoid hyperplasia" when architecture is preserved and no clonal process is identified; in such cases, if clinical suspicion for malignancy persists, excisional biopsy or repeat sampling may be needed because core or FNA can miss focal lymphoma or architectural patterns critical for diagnosis [^1159db8e] [^116dCCqq].

> Let me synthesize a clinically actionable definition. "Likely reactive adenopathy" means enlarged lymph nodes thought to represent a benign, immunologic response to infection, inflammation, autoimmune activity, or iatrogenic stimuli, characterized by non-clonal lymphoid hyperplasia on histology and benign imaging features, with a low but nonzero risk of malignancy that guides the threshold for observation versus biopsy based on size, location, duration, systemic symptoms, and patient risk factors [^116EJVzK] [^1159db8e] [^114UKtom].

> I should confirm follow-up recommendations. For unexplained localized lymphadenopathy without red flags, observation for about 2–4 weeks with reassessment is reasonable. Persistence beyond 4–6 weeks, nodes larger than 2 cm, hard or fixed nodes, supraclavicular location, generalized distribution, or B symptoms should prompt imaging and consideration of biopsy, with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the neck as first-line in adults and ultrasound guiding superficial node assessment and biopsy planning [^116EJVzK] [^114UKtom].

"Likely reactive adenopathy" means the lymph node enlargement is **probably benign and due to an immune response** to infection, inflammation, or vaccination rather than malignancy [^116EJVzK]. It is characterized by **nodes that are soft, mobile, and under 2 cm**, often with tenderness and no systemic "B" symptoms [^116EJVzK]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical context, exam, and selective imaging** (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) [^114UKtom]; biopsy is reserved for persistent (> 4–6 weeks), large (> 2 cm), hard, fixed, or progressively enlarging nodes, or if systemic symptoms or high-risk features are present [^116EJVzK]. Management is observation and treating the underlying cause; prognosis is excellent, with most nodes resolving within weeks to months [^116EJVzK].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Benign nature**: Likely reactive adenopathy is non-malignant and reflects a normal immune response, not cancer [^116EJVzK].
- **Common causes**: Infections (viral, bacterial, fungal), inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, and vaccinations are typical triggers [^111Gkntp] [^112NNArE].
- **Prognosis**: Excellent; most cases resolve spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying cause [^116EJVzK].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

- **Node characteristics**: Soft, mobile, < 2 cm, often tender, without hard or fixed consistency [^116EJVzK].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Usually absent; no fever, night sweats, or weight loss [^116EJVzK].
- **Duration**: Typically acute or subacute, resolving within weeks to a few months [^116EJVzK].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound shows preserved fatty hilum, central vascularity, and homogeneous echotexture; CT/MRI show homogeneous enhancement without necrosis or calcification [^116dCCqq] [^117EdsvW].
- **Biopsy**: Not routine; reserved for persistent, large, hard, fixed, or progressively enlarging nodes, or if systemic symptoms or high-risk features are present [^116EJVzK].

---

## Common causes and associated conditions

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Viral (EBV, CMV, HIV, influenza) [^111L39fR] [^117EdsvW] <br/> - Bacterial (strep, staph, TB, cat-scratch) [^notfound] <br/> - Fungal (histoplasmosis, cryptococcus) [^notfound] |
| Inflammatory/autoimmune | - Rheumatoid arthritis [^114w4sqo] <br/> - SLE [^115cDFwC] <br/> - Sjögren's [^116VZewi] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^117Buki6] <br/> - IgG4-related disease [^114uqHqG] |
| Vaccination-related | - COVID-19 mRNA vaccines [^112NNArE] [^112R1Lic] <br/> - Influenza <br/> - MMR <br/> - HPV [^notfound] |
| Miscellaneous | - Drug reactions <br/> - Foreign body reactions <br/> - Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy [^111Gkntp] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History and exam**: Assess duration, associated symptoms, exposures, travel, vaccinations, and systemic features [^116EJVzK].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, infectious serologies (EBV, HIV, TB), autoimmune panels as indicated [^116EJVzK].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound for superficial nodes; CT/MRI for deep nodes or when malignancy is suspected [^114UKtom].
- **Biopsy**: Reserved for persistent (> 4–6 weeks), large (> 2 cm), hard, fixed, or progressively enlarging nodes, or if systemic symptoms or high-risk features are present [^116EJVzK].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **observation with reassurance** and treatment of the underlying cause (e.g. antibiotics for bacterial infection, antivirals for specific viruses, immunomodulation for autoimmune disease) [^116EJVzK]. Follow-up should monitor for resolution; if nodes persist or progress, escalate to biopsy or advanced imaging [^116EJVzK].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **excellent**, with most cases resolving within weeks to months [^116EJVzK]. Follow-up should include clinical reassessment at 2–4 weeks; if nodes persist beyond 4–6 weeks, enlarge, or develop concerning features, obtain further evaluation and consider biopsy [^116EJVzK].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Complications are rare; **persistent enlargement** may cause cosmetic or mechanical issues, and misclassification can delay diagnosis of underlying malignancy or serious disease. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary biopsies or interventions, so careful clinical judgment is essential [^116EJVzK].

---

"Likely reactive adenopathy" reflects a **benign immune response** with favorable prognosis; most cases resolve with observation and treatment of the cause, but persistent or atypical nodes require targeted evaluation to exclude malignancy or serious disease [^116EJVzK].

### Lymphadenopathy in fungating extremity soft-tissue sarcoma: metastasis or reactive? [^111k2WNu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with fungating extremity soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) can develop lymphadenopathy, which can represent nodal metastasis or benign reactive adenopathy.

Methods

In 1787 patients with STS, 67 (3.7%) had fungating extremity STS. In the 62 patients who met our inclusion criteria, we evaluated prevalence and histopathology of lymphadenopathy, factors associated with lymphadenopathy and nodal metastasis, and prevalence of and factors associated with lung metastasis and survival time from fungation. Logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to analyze node pathology, lung metastasis, and survival duration with α = 0.05.

Results

Lymphadenopathy occurred in 11 of 62 patients (18%), 6 with nodal metastasis and 5 with reactive adenopathy. The only factor associated with lymphadenopathy was location of primary tumor in the upper extremity (p = 0.02). No tumor characteristics were associated with nodal metastasis. In all five patients with reactive adenopathy, the condition was recognized within 3 days after tumor fungation. Lymphadenopathy recognized more than 3 days after tumor fungation was likely to be nodal metastasis. Forty-one percent of patients developed lung metastasis, which was not associated with presence of lymphadenopathy or any patient or tumor characteristic. Age, tumor size, and Black and Asian race were independently associated with greater risk of death.

Conclusions

Eighteen percent of patients with fungating extremity STS developed lymphadenopathy. Approximately half of cases represented nodal metastasis, and half represented reactive adenopathy. Lymphadenopathy that develops within 3 days after tumor fungation should increase suspicion for reactive adenopathy versus nodal metastasis.

### COVID-19 vaccination-associated axillary adenopathy: imaging findings and follow-up recommendations in 23 women [^112NNArE]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this article is to report on 23 women with evidence of axillary adenopathy at breast imaging after recent COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 13% of patients had symptoms (axillary lump), 43% were undergoing screening, and 43% were undergoing diagnostic imaging for other reasons. BI-RADS category 2 was assigned in one case, BI-RADS 3 in 21 (ultrasound in 4–24 weeks), and BI-RADS 4 in one. Radiologist familiarity and evidence-based guidelines are needed to avoid follow-up imaging and biopsies for reactive adenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination.

### Practical imaging approach to determining the cause of nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy [^111Gkntp]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the daily clinical practice of radiologists, unexpected lymphadenopathy is frequently encountered, the majority of which is nonneoplastic. The causes of nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy are variable, and nonspecific histologic findings may challenge the accurate diagnosis. Therefore, inferring or identifying the cause based on imaging findings carries substantial clinical relevance. The causes of nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy can be broadly categorized as follows: (a) infections that lead to lymphadenitis; (b) systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis, Kawasaki disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, immunoglobulin G4-related disease, Castleman disease, dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and histiocytosis; (c) iatrogenic causes including drug-induced lymphadenopathy and COVID-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy; and (d) miscellaneous causes including congestion from heart failure, foreign body lymphadenopathy from substances such as silicone, epithelial inclusions in lymph nodes, and tumor-associated reactive lymphadenopathy. The distribution of lymphadenopathy, imaging characteristics of the enlarged lymph nodes themselves (eg, necrosis, cystic changes, hypervascularity, or calcification), and additional imaging findings in other organs can help narrow down the differential diagnosis and potentially identify the most likely cause. Even when the underlying cause of lymphadenopathy does not require treatment, establishing the likely cause and correctly excluding malignancy can prevent unnecessary tests and excessive interventions, such as biopsies. Thus, radiologists can play a crucial role in directing the management of such patients and must be familiar with the various conditions that result in nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy, their imaging findings, and their clinical manifestations. The authors provide an overview of these conditions and their imaging appearances and discuss approaches for identifying the cause of nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy based on imaging findings as well as clinical information. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### HIV lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and important imaging features [^114nWCYb]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review important imaging and clinical features to help elucidate causes of lymphadenopathy in patients with HIV infection. CONCLUSION. HIV lymphadenopathy has various causes generally categorized as inflammatory or reactive, such as immune reconstitution syndrome; infectious, such as tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and HIV infection itself; and neoplastic, such as lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and Castleman disease. It is important to consider patients' demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, CD4 lymphocyte counts, and radiologic features to identify likely causes of lymphadenopathy.

### The pathology of reactive lymphadenopathies: a discussion of common reactive patterns and their malignant mimics [^1159db8e]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

-Distinguishing between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphoid proliferation is a clinically significant task frequently performed by the surgical pathologist in routine practice.

Objectives

-To highlight common situations in lymph node pathology where reactive changes and lymphoma may be misdiagnosed.

Data Sources

-Data sources are peer-reviewed journal articles, textbooks, and clinical experience.

Conclusions

-This review aims to refresh and enhance the surgical pathologist's awareness of the shared and distinguishing features of select reactive and neoplastic lymphoproliferations, which in turn will allow the surgical pathologist to make more accurate diagnoses and avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. This will be done by describing a selection of commonly encountered reactive histologic changes observed in lymph nodes, present the lymphomas with which they share overlapping features, outline the features that distinguish them, and describe an approach to making an accurate diagnosis and avoiding a misdiagnosis in each scenario.

### Pediatric inflammatory adenopathy [^112gpHpK]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis in pediatric lymphadenopathy includes bacterial, viral, fungal, and idiopathic causes. A systematic approach to patient evaluation is necessary because the differential diagnosis, presentation, and work up must consider infectious, immunologic, neoplastic, and idiopathic disorders. A thorough history and examination are vital to determining the diagnosis and ruling out a malignant process.

### Role of EUS for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy [^115xPYjm]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Role of EUS for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy — guideline methodology and recommendation wording are described as follows: recommendations were "graded on the strength of the supporting evidence", the "strength of individual recommendations is based on both the aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of the anticipated benefits and harms", weaker statements use "we suggest" and stronger ones "we recommend", and the document "is intended to be an educational device" and "is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care".

### Safety of cold-adapted live attenuated influenza vaccine in a large cohort of children and adolescents [^113bDno7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety of cold-adapted trivalent intranasal influenza virus vaccine (CAIV) in children and adolescents.

Study Design

A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled safety trial in healthy children age 12 months to 17 years given CAIV (FluMist; MedImmune Vaccines, Inc.) or placebo (randomization, 2:1). Children < 9 years of age received a second dose of CAIV or placebo 28 to 42 days after the first dose. Enrolled children were then followed for 42 days after each vaccination for all medically attended events. Prespecified outcomes included 4 prespecified diagnostic groups and 170 observed individual diagnostic categories. The relative risk and the 2-sided 90% confidence interval were calculated for each diagnostic group and individual category by clinical setting, dose and age. More than 1500 relative risk analyses were performed.

Results

A total of 9689 evaluable children were enrolled in the study. Of the 4 prespecified diagnostic categories (acute respiratory tract events, systemic bacterial infection, acute gastrointestinal tract events and rare events potentially associated with wild-type influenza), none was associated with vaccine. Of the biologically plausible individual diagnostic categories, 3, acute gastrointestinal events, acute respiratory events and abdominal pain, had different analyses that demonstrated increased and decreased relative risks, making their association with the vaccine unlikely. For reactive airway disease a significant increased relative risk was observed in children 18 to 35 months of age with a relative risk of 4.06 (90% confidence interval, 1.29 to 17.86) in this age group. The individual diagnostic categories of upper respiratory infection, musculoskeletal pain, otitis media with effusion and adenitis/adenopathy had at least one analysis that achieved a significant increased risk ratio. All of these events were infrequent.

Conclusion

CAIV was generally safe in children and adolescents. The observation of an increased risk of asthma/reactive airway disease in children < 36 months of age is of potential concern. Further studies are planned to evaluate the risk of asthma/reactive airway disease after vaccine.

### Prediction of effective humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in healthy subjects by cortical thickness of post-vaccination reactive lymphadenopathy [^111KTzf1]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Therefore, widespread cases of reactive unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy were reported after the introduction of the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign. While axillary and supraclavicular adenopathy ipsilateral to the injection site has also been documented after administration of other vaccines in the past, no data exist on the correlation between vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy and the elicited immune response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The aim of this study is to assess, in healthy adults, a potential association between the phenomenon of reactive hyperplastic lymphadenopathy identified on post-vaccination ultrasound and the humoral immunity revealed by serologic testing.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^111LsTwj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory breast disorders — initial evaluation states that women with breast erythema, warmth, pain, and fever should be evaluated with a detailed history and complete breast examination, with attention to inflammatory and skin changes, regional adenopathy, and presence or absence of a mass. In the context of a discrete mass, age-appropriate breast imaging (starting with ultrasonography) is recommended. Infectious mastitis is the most likely cause of these findings, and early treatment of breast infections may decrease abscess formation, although an abscess may be present at initial presentation.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Quantitative vascular feature-based multimodality prediction model for multi-origin malignant cervical lymphadenopathy [^117M2w7x]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical lymphadenopathy is a systematic disease with multiple etiologies, including reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, metastasis, lymphoma, and rare entities. The risk of malignancy increases with age, and the rate of such cases is as high as nearly 75% among patients older than 40 years. Malignant cervical lymphadenopathy may originate from different primary tumors, which reflects the biological tendency of primary cancer cells from different organs to disseminate through the lymphatic vasculature. Careful vigilance is warranted given that this situation indicates an unfavorable prognosis. Currently, nodal biopsy is commonly performed to clarify the nature of cervical lymphadenopathy. However, benign cervical lymphadenopathy accounts for up to 30.7% of cases involving biopsy for suspected malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. Additionally, biopsy is an invasive procedure, with potential risks of surgical complications and healthcare service burdens. Accordingly, a trustworthy method is needed for assessing cervical lymphadenopathy before biopsy.

### Analysis of children with peripheral lymphadenopathy [^116TgLXC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In this study, the clinical and laboratory features of children with lymphadenopathy were evaluated. Over a 3-year period, 126 patients were referred to the clinic for lymphadenopathy. Twenty-eight of cases have diseases mimicking lymphadenopathy; 98 (mean age: 86 ± 55 months) have lymphadenopathy. Localized, limited, and generalized involvement was found in 52%, 30%, and 18% of patients. The most common localization was the head and neck region. The causes of lymphadenopathy were benign diseases in 75 patients. Sixty percent were reactive lymphadenopathy, 39% were lymphadenitis. Lymphadenitis was more frequently localized and bigger than 3 cm compared with reactive adenopathy (p = .02, p = .004). Twenty-three patients have malignant diseases whose mean age was higher than others (p = .002). The enlargement of supraclavicular nodes was more likely due to malignant disease (p = .001). The risk of malignant disease was higher in patients who had generalized lymphadenopathy, lymph nodes bigger than 3 cm, hepatosplenomegaly, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. In conclusion, this study pointed out the important clues for the differential diagnosis, which were present in the history, physical, and laboratory findings.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders including RA, SLE and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Ultrasound features to differentiate COVID-19 vaccine-induced benign adenopathy from breast cancer related malignant adenopathy [^114fzP57]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objective

To identify nodal features used to distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-Induced benign reactive adenopathy from malignant adenopathy.

Materials and Methods

This IRB-approved, single-institution, retrospective study compared features of 77 consecutive patients with benign adenopathy secondary to a messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine with 76 patients with biopsy-proven malignant adenopathy from breast cancer. Patient demographics and nodal features were compared between the two groups using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. A receiver operating characteristic analysis with the maximum value of Youden's index was performed for the cutoff value of cortical thickness for predicting nodal status.

Results

The mean cortical thickness was 5.1 mm ± 2.8 mm among benign nodes and 8.9 mm ± 4.5 mm among malignant nodes (p < 0.001). A cortical thickness ≥ 3.0 mm had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 21% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–0.68). When the cutoff for cortical thickness was increased to ≥ 5.4 mm, the sensitivity decreased to 74%, while the specificity increased to 69% (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70–0.84). Cortical thickness correlated with nodal morphology type (r² = 0.57). An axillary node with generalized lobulated cortical thickening had a 7.5 odds ratio and a node with focal cortical lobulation had a 123.0 odds ratio compared to one with diffuse, uniform cortical thickening only (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Cortical thickness and morphology are predictive of malignancy. Cortical thickness cutoff of ≥ 5.4 mm demonstrates higher specificity and improved accuracy for detecting malignant adenopathy than a cutoff of ≥ 3.0 mm.

### Significance of asymptomatic tonsil asymmetry [^113GFJLX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymmetry of tonsils that arouses suspicion for malignancy is one of the indications for tonsillectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of occult malignancy in patients with asymptomatic unilateral tonsillar enlargement. Study design and setting A prospective controlled trial was carried out in two institutions, Beyoglu Research and Training Hospital and Karaelmas University Hospital, during a 6-year period. Of patients selected for tonsillectomy, patients with unilateral tonsillar enlargement were identified and were included in this study. Patients who had risk factors that were significant for malignancy were excluded. After excision, two tonsil specimens were measured before sending for histology. Matched controls with symmetric tonsils underwent the same procedures. Preoperative diagnosis of tonsil asymmetry with the postoperative histologic diagnosis were correlated for the incidence of malignancy.

Results

Of the 792 patients undergoing tonsillectomy, 53 patients (6.69%) with asymmetry of tonsils and who had no other risk factors for malignancy underwent tonsillectomy. The size difference of the tonsils ranged from 0 to 19 mm. In the control group of 51 patients with symmetric tonsils, the size difference ranged from 0 to 8 mm. The analysis showed statistically significant difference in the degree of asymmetry between the two groups (P < .001). Most of the specimens contained reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in both groups (58.49% and 54.9%, respectively). No malignancies or unusual pathological findings were encountered on histologic examination in either group. Conclusion and significance Tonsil asymmetry may only be apparent in patients with an otherwise normal physical examination, secondary to benign hyperplasia or anatomical factors. Therefore, the presence of tonsil asymmetry without factors such as suspicious appearance, significant systemic signs and symptoms, progressive enlargement of the tonsil, concomitant neck adenopathies, and history of malignancy or immunocompromise, may not indicate malignancy, as a sole clinical feature.

### Widespread reactive lymphatic and splenic FDG avidity after mRNA COVID vaccination [^116P7xSb]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 75-year-old woman with history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in remission develops new widespread FDG-avid lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis on surveillance PET/CT, as well as intense FDG uptake in the spleen, without evidence of local recurrence. Short-term follow-up PET demonstrates near-complete resolution of FDG-avid lymphatic and splenic FDG avidity without interval change in management. Further history reveals that the patient received her fifth dose of COVID mRNA vaccine 6 days before the abnormal PET. Although unilateral axillary adenopathy after COVID vaccination is well-recognized, this widespread symmetric lymphatic and splenic FDG avidity is a significantly rarer phenomenon.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114M5qfM]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma — monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis criteria and SLL diagnostic caveat: An absolute monoclonal B lymphocyte count < 5000/mm³ that persists more than 3 months without palpable adenopathy or other clinical features of lymphoproliferative disorder is MBL; cells of the same phenotype may be seen in reactive lymph nodes, so diagnosis of SLL should only be made when effacement of lymph node architecture is seen, and bone marrow examination is not helpful for the diagnosis of MBL.

### Management of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy detected on breast MRI in the era of COVID-19 vaccination [^116yFxER]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Early clinical experience with COVID-19 vaccination suggests that approved COVID-19 vaccines cause a notably higher incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy on breast MRI compared with other vaccines. Guidelines are needed to appropriately manage unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy detected by MRI in the era of COVID-19 vaccination and to avoid biopsies of benign reactive nodes. This article examines the available data on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and offers a basic strategy for assessing axillary lymphadenopathy on MRI and guiding management. At our institution, we are adding questions regarding the date(s) and laterality of administration of COVID-19 vaccination to the intake form given to patients before all breast imaging examinations. We consider MRI-detected isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination arm to most likely be related to the COVID-19 vaccine if it develops within 4 weeks of administration of either dose. In these cases, we assess the lymphadenopathy as BI-RADS 3 and recommend that follow-up ultrasound be performed within 6–8 weeks after administration of the second dose. These guidelines may be refined as we acquire further data on the expected time course of axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination. Until that time, this management pathway will help avoid unnecessary biopsies of benign vaccine-related reactive lymphadenopathy.

Infectious Etiologies

HIV

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes progressive immunodeficiency through the gradual destruction of CD4 + T-lymphocytes, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other complications. Currently, in the USA, there are 16,350 yearly deaths from AIDS-related illnesses.

Lymphadenopathy is one of the more common manifestations of HIV and can occur as a direct effect of HIV itself or secondarily from opportunistic infections and/or HIV-related malignancies. In tuberculosis-endemic regions, mycobacterial infections are the most frequent cause whereas reactive lymphadenopathy is more common in non-endemic regions. Reactive HIV adenopathy — or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) — is the result of a series of nodal histologic changes that the virus induces, characterized by concurrent reactive follicular hyperplasia and lysis early on with subsequent follicular regression and finally lymphocyte depletion. PGL is seen in up to 50–70% of HIV patients. Lymph nodes are typically symmetric and painless and most commonly involve cervical, submandibular, and axillary chains. Mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal lymph nodes may be involved as well. Significant hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rare.

PGL does not have a characteristic imaging appearance. Lymph nodes are discrete, homogeneous, and less than 1.5 cm in size. Calcifications, perinodal infiltration, and nodal necrosis are uncharacteristic. Lymph nodes appear isodense to muscle on non-contrast CT and homogeneously enhance with contrast (Fig. 2a). On MRI, they are T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense, and similarly enhance to those on CT.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111BfqA5]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact on mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

Differentiating reactive and pathological IMHL

A univariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine factors that differed significantly between patients with reactive and pathological IMHL (table 2). In univariate analysis, factors associated with an increased likelihood of reactive lymphadenopathy included increasing age (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.11), white British ethnicity (OR 4.65, 95% CI 1.76 to 12.26) and the presence of comorbidity (OR 27.86, 95% CI 9.49 to 81.77); factors associated with a reduced likelihood of a reactive lymphadenopathy were symptoms of weight loss (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) and fevers (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.45) and lymph node characteristics including increased numbers of enlarged lymph node stations (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99) and larger lymph node diameter (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79). Multivariate analysis showed increasing age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13; p = 0.033) and the presence of at least one relevant comorbidity (OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.20 to 41.04; p = 0.003) to predict for reactive lymphadenopathy and increased maximum lymph node size (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; p = 0.00004) to predict pathological IMHL.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116VZewi]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sjögren's syndrome

SS represents one of the rheumatologic conditions in which lymphadenopathy is most commonly observed. Benign, reactive lymphadenopathy is observed in 10–56% of cases, with patients tending to be younger and with a shorter disease duration, and with a predominance of females over males. Over 90% of cases are localized with involvement of cervical lymph nodes, while other possible involved areas are the axillary and supraclavicular regions. Extra-glandular involvement is significantly more common in patients with lymphadenopathy. More specifically, the frequency of salivary gland swelling, peripheral nervous system involvement, palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, neutropenia and lymphopenia is higher in patients with lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, positivity rates of ANA and anti-Ro-SSA antibodies are higher in this subset of patients, while correlation with higher titres of RFs and cryoglobulinemia has been reported but not confirmed in different cohorts. Finally, lymphadenopathy has been reported to correlate with higher focus score. Overall, lymphadenopathy correlates with disease activity and this has been formalized with the inclusion of lymphadenopathy in the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Activity Index (ESSAI). All these features correlate with an increased risk of lymphoma development. Indeed, lymphadenopathy has been indicated as a potential predictor of lymphoma development. Similar to SLE and RA, benign lymphadenopathy in SS seems to be characterized by reactive follicular hyperplasia with increased number of lymphoid follicles, similar to that observed in the ectopic lymphoid tissue of SS salivary glands.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116dCCqq]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Imaging

Doppler US is an easily accessible tool with which to investigate lymphadenopathy. The presence of nodal matting, surrounding soft tissue oedema and prominent hilar vascularity, for instance, are suggestive of a reactive inflammatory process. Features suggestive of underlying malignancy are nodal hypoechogenenicity and alteration in nodal vascularization, with presence of avascular areas, displacement of vessels and peripheral vascularity.

CT and MRI techniques allow better characterization of nodal tissue, assessment of distribution and possible identification of other pathological lesions. 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET is often able to discriminate between reactive and malignant lymph nodes based on the levels of standardized uptake values (SUVs) and selecting the most active lymph node for diagnostic biopsy. US and CT also represent indispensable tools to guide lymph node biopsy or fine-needle aspiration. Table 1 illustrates the most important clinical and radiological 'red flags' that may point towards a neoplastic or infectious aetiology of lymphadenopathy.

Table 1.
'Red flags' associated with malignancy or infection that may be useful in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy

Histological findings

Open excisional biopsy allows the histologic evaluation of intact tissue, providing information about the cellularity and architecture, and is preferred when lymphoma is suspected. While core needle biopsy provides limited information regarding lymph node architecture, it bears lower morbidity and provides some information on tissue architecture and material for immunohistochemical, genetic and molecular analysis. Complete lymph node excision is generally preferred but core biopsy is recommended when anatomical accessibility precludes excising an intact lymph node. Lastly, fine-needle aspiration provides cells for cytological analysis, most useful in cases of suspected recurrence of malignancy. Lack of information about tissue architecture and limited sampling renders this technique minimally useful for the diagnosis of lymphoma.

### Reactive lymph nodes in pediatric practice [^1115uysS]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

A variety of unusual reactive conditions may be seen in lymph nodes from the pediatric age group. Some of these, such as the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, reflect underlying abnormalities of the immune system and cellular control processes, while others are related to viral infections or are of unknown cause. Many of these conditions can mimic malignant neoplasms, so it is important that pathologists recognize these unusual reactive patterns.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^1127CGjH]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy (LA) is common and affects patients of all ages. An annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% has been estimated for the general population. Patients with lymphadenopathy present to a wide range of medical specialties. When physicians are faced with these patients, the critical tasks are to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes, to identify serious medical conditions that require specialist care, and to reassure patients with benign reactive lymphadenopathy or self-limiting diseases.

The possibility of malignancy raises the most concern among patients and health care professionals. Prompt referral for definitive investigations and treatment cannot be overstated, as cancer is perhaps the disease people fear most. Despite the incidences of many cancers being broadly similar in England compared with other European countries and the USA, the corresponding survival rates are poorer (Table 1

Table 1
Five-year relative survival of common cancers). To address this problem, the British government proposed, in September 2000, the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan to provide a comprehensive strategy for bringing together prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care for cancer to improve survival. The current guideline recommends all patients with lymphadenopathy of more than 1 cm in size persisting for 6 weeks to be referred urgently for further evaluation.

Apart from cancer, there are also other medical conditions presenting with LA that will require urgent medical attention. This would include infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both of which pose an important public health problem. In addition, immune-induced injury disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis will also require specialist care.

### Zoonotic filariasis caused by novel brugia sp. nematode, United States, 2011 [^115kLubR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Removal of an affected lymph node without additional treatment is often considered sufficient treatment for zoonotic filariases. However, for the patient reported here, persistence of inguinal swelling prompted a repeat biopsy 4 months later; the specimen again demonstrated reactive follicular hyperplasia, although no parasites were seen. Because the patient's initial clinical signs and subsequent persistent adenopathy were reminiscent of unilateral lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, and induration that are typical of B. malayi or B. timori filariasis, and the microfilariae in the original biopsy sample appeared to be viable, we empiricially prescribed a standard dosage of oral doxycycline for 6 weeks, followed by single doses of ivermectin at 400 μg/kg and 800 mg albendazole. The patient has been well, without further adenopathy or eosinophilia, for > 2 years. Because adult filariae can live for > 10 years, the place of acquisition cannot be stated with certainty.

The prevalence of zoonotic infection with Brugia spp. nematodes is unknown. Many reported cases are asymptomatic or diagnosed incidentally during evaluation for persistent adenopathy. Conversely, differentiation of zoonotic from classical filariasis is unlikely in disease-endemic areas; most cases published since the initial 1962 case report occurred in the United States. Most case-patients were from the Northeast, including New York (8 cases), Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (3 cases each); single cases have been identified in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Louisiana, Florida, and California. Four other cases have been reported: 3 in South America (Colombia, Brazil, Peru) and 1 in Africa (Ethiopia). Only a few Brugia species have been identified, including B. leporis, found in rabbits in the northeastern United States; B. beaveri, found in raccoons and bobcats in the southern United States; and B. guyanensis, found in coatimundi and other vertebrates in South America. Definitive identification with molecular techniques will better identify causative species and help clarify many of the ecologic and epidemiologic questions surrounding zoonotic filarial infections.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### A study of patients with isolated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy undergoing EBUS-TBNA [^115cELZr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main findings

The cause of IMHL was investigated in 100 consecutive patients referred for EBUS-TBNA at a tertiary UK centre. A pathological diagnosis was confirmed in 52 patients, and 48 patients were categorised as having reactive lymphadenopathy (n = 48) after repeat sampling or a minimum of 6 months follow-up (mean 16.8 months). EBUS-TBNA correctly diagnosed 91% of patients with an overall sensitivity of 82.7% and NPV of 84.2% (95% CI 72.6% to 91.5%).

The study also investigated the potential of a number of prospectively recorded patient-related and lymph node-related covariates to differentiate reactive from pathological IMHL. Multivariate analysis showed that age, the presence of comorbidity associated with IMHL and lymph node size to be most discriminating. Lymph node size was the strongest predictor of aetiology, with a maximum lymph node diameter of 15 mm or less always reactive (n = 16) and always pathological when greater than 25 mm (n = 25). The association of increasing age with reactive IMHL was primarily due to patients diagnosed with granulomatous disorders being significantly younger; no difference in age was seen with patients diagnosed with malignancy. There was a very high prevalence of comorbidities known to be associated with IMHL in patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (n = 39/48, 81.2%), significantly higher than patients with pathological lymphadenopathy (n = 7/52, 13.5%; p = < 0.000001). Indeed, a patient with at least one comorbidity was almost 10 times more likely to have reactive rather than pathological IMHL. This supports the evidence of associations in the published literature and underlines the nature of the lymphadenopathy as 'reacting' to underlying comorbidities. The NPV of EBUS-TBNA in low-risk patients, defined as those with a maximum lymph node size less than 20 mm and having at least one comorbidity, was 93.8% (95% CI 79.9% to 98.3%) with only two patients having granulomatous disorders and none having malignancy in this cohort.

### Validity and reliability of transbronchial needle aspiration for diagnosing mediastinal adenopathies [^113UhToR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In our study, we found that the validity of TBNA in different pathologies responsible for mediastinal adenopathy varied considerably. The greatest sensitivity and accuracy were obtained for small cell lung carcinoma and the least for lymphoproliferative diseases. This could be due to the higher diameter of adenopathies in patients with small cell carcinoma, as this type of neoplasia is aggressive and its cells have poor adhesion qualities. The poor results obtained in cases of lymphoma could reflect the need for larger samples to make a specific diagnosis of the type of lymphoma. Moreover, we considered samples that were ambiguous or suggestive but not completely conclusive to be non-adequate. There were no significant differences in TBNA outcomes among non small cell lung carcinomas, extrapulmonary carcinomas, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. Anthracotic and reactive adenopathies presented special situations. In many of them, the next step was the follow-up, taking into account the low clinical suspicious of specific processes. However, according to a recently published systematic review, these differences are not observed in most published studies when TBNA is performed with ultrasound (EBUS-TBNA) and the sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA is much higher than the reported in this study with convencional TBNA alone.

The low NPV we found for all pathologies (≈ 10%) as compared to published NPVs is particularly notable because the NPV may influence patient management. It is possible that the restrictive definitions we used for FN and TN contributed to this low NPV. A recent retrospective study analyzed the results of TBNA of mediastinal adenopathies in 194 patients (157 with lung cancer). The NPV of TBNA was 29% if all results were included and 64% if only adequate samples were evaluated. However, results similar to ours (NPV = 11–20%) were reported in several recent studies using endoscopic ultrasound in patients with lung cancer and sarcoidoisis. This suggests that any negative test should be verified by other techniques, even when only a large number of lymphocytes are present, because the NPVs for these cases in our study were less than 70%.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

### The "cluster of black pearls" sign of sarcoid lymphadenopathy: a new sign on thin-section contrast-enhanced multidetector CT [^117RNnE3]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify a specific diagnostic sign for sarcoid adenopathy on contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) based on nodal morphology.

Materials and Methods

A prospective study was performed on 105 patients with 1654 nodes. Of this, 18 patients with sarcoidosis formed the study group. The control group consisted of the remaining 87 patients with other proven disease entities of metastatic adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and reactive adenopathy for comparison. CT examinations were undertaken using a 64-section helical mode in the arterial and venous phases with a 0.5-mm section thickness. The lymph nodes were evaluated for various morphological criteria and the presence of the "cluster of black pearls" (CBP) sign. The CBP sign was considered present when tiny round nodules each measuring 1–2 mm were seen distributed uniformly within the whole or part of the lymph node.

Results

The CBP sign had a significance of p < 0.001, 83% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 91% positive predictive value, and 96% negative predictive value on a per node basis and a sensitivity of 100% on a per patient basis.

Conclusion

The CBP sign is an accurate morphological sign differentiating sarcoid from other adenopathy.

### Lymph nodes as gatekeepers of autoimmune diseases [^1156wdiJ]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

In Sjogren's syndrome (SS), lymphadenopathy is known to be localised to the cervical LN and possibly associated with salivary gland swelling and the presence of some autoantibodies. However very little is currently known about the cellular components of the cervical LN in SS which definitely warrants further investigation.

The extensive presence of lymphadenopathy in autoimmune diseases is evident; however, in the majority of cases, possibly excluding MS, this presence is rarely specific enough to be considered a diagnostic factor. The strong presence of lymphadenopathy in established disease is likely reflective of chronic inflammation. Evidence to date suggests that it is important to rule out the lymphadenopathy as a consequence of malignancy, particularly in the case of SS, infection or as a major defining feature of rarer diseases, such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related diseases, where aetiology and autoimmune components are even more elusive. A clear focus on the specific LNs proximal to inflammatory sites that characterise each of these diseases provides a more accurate picture. This, in turn, explains why in SLE, where multiple tissue sites are involved, there is more generalised lymphadenopathy. These findings provide compelling evidence for further investigation into LN changes and suggest an activated tissue site with increased immune cell infiltration.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for evaluating lymphadenopathy in the pediatric emergency department: case series and review of literature [^114LuJXs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Children present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with enlarged lymph nodes due to a broad spectrum of conditions ranging from benign causes like reactive lymph nodes to adverse conditions like malignancy. Identifying sonographic features typical of infection, inflammation, and neoplasms will help assist clinicians in deciding the disposition of the patients from the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound has become an essential adjunct for diagnostic assessment in pediatric emergency medicine. The wider accessibility of ultrasound along with greater resolution using high-frequency probes places this noninvasive, nonradiation-based bedside examination, an ideal tool for real-time examination of the lymph nodes in the EDs.

Case Series

We present a series of cases in which the point-of-care ultrasound examination proved valuable in the timely diagnosis and expedited care of lymph node pathologies secondary to reactive, infectious, and malignant processes. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point-of-care ultrasound will facilitate diagnosis in children with lymph node swelling and should be considered in children of all ages. While assessing the lymph node pathology at the bedside, describe the shape, size, internal echotexture, borders, vascularity, and the pattern of the perinodal soft tissue to differentiate between a normal, reactive, infectious, inflammatory, or malignant underlying pathology.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### A case of Kawasaki disease masked by pustular type psoriasiform eruptions [^111Uxqfn]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The absence of culprit drugs and minimal eosinophils on histology made the diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis unlikely. Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, the diagnosis of pustular psoriasis was made, and the patient was treated with mid-potency topical corticosteroids. Significant improvement was noted at 6-day follow-up with resolution of pustules and decreased erythema. At the 2-week follow-up, the patient still had a low-grade fever and a red and fissured lip with a strawberry tongue. Striking periungual desquamation appeared on the fingers and toes (Fig 3). The patient lacked cervical adenopathy and conjunctivitis. Laboratory tests found that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and platelet count were elevated.

In light of the new clinical findings and the reactive thrombocytosis, atypical KD was diagnosed. Fortunately, electrocardiography and echocardiography did not detect any cardiovascular abnormalities. Given the delay in the diagnosis of KD, the patient was not a candidate for intravenous immunoglobulin and was treated with low dose salicylic acid.

Diffuse lymphadenopathy has a long differential diagnosis that includes both malignant and benign causes. As part of the lymphadenopathy work-up, many patients undergo [18 F]FDG-PET/CT for purposes of ruling out malignancy. FDG-avid lymph nodes, however, are not specific for malignancy. This review will illustrate the spectrum of nodal findings on FDG-PET/CT with correlation to other cross-sectional imaging and clinical history in patients with representative infectious, inflammatory, and benign lymphoproliferative disorders. These findings are important for the nuclear medicine radiologist to understand, as they can represent common pitfalls in the work-up of lymphadenopathy. While FDG-PET/CT may be limited in ascertaining a definitive diagnosis in a disease process as the cause of lymphadenopathy, it can help to narrow this differential and rule out certain diseases in the correct clinical context.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### The diagnostic yield of excisional biopsy in cervical lymphadenopathy: a retrospective analysis of 158 biopsies in adults [^117GVttR]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cervical lymph nodes are the most common site of peripheral lymphadenopathy. The underlying etiologies are usually benign and self-limiting but may include malignancies or other severe life-threatening diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the various underlying pathologies of cervical lymphadenopathy as assessed by the diagnostic yield of excisional lymph node biopsies of the neck in a tertiary adult practice. The evaluation was performed in light of previous literature and regional epidemiological patterns.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of hospital charts of 158 adult patients who underwent an excisional biopsy for suspected cervical lymphadenopathy at a tertiary referral head and neck service between January 2017 and December 2019.

Results

The most common underlying pathology was unspecific and/or reactive lymphadenitis in 44.5% of specimens, followed by malignant disease in 38.6% of cases. An age above 40 years was significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of malignant disease. Lower jugular and posterior triangle lymph nodes showed higher malignancy rates than other groups (100% and 66.7%, respectively). The overall surgical complication rate was 2.5%.

Conclusions

The results of the current study serve as an indicator of the variety of etiologies causing cervical lymphadenopathy. In particular, given the increasing incidence of malignant diseases in recent decades, the findings should alert physicians to the importance of lymph node biopsy for excluding malignancy in persistent cervical lymphadenopathy especially in older adults. The findings emphasize the value of excisional lymph node biopsy of the neck as a useful diagnostic tool in adult patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^114T2ofA]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The differential for diffuse lymphadenopathy includes numerous malignant and benign etiologies, many of which demonstrate FDG avidity on PET/CT. Traditional quantitative PET/CT parameters, such as SUV max, have not been shown to be able to accurately distinguish among these benign and malignant causes, limiting its role in diagnosis and screening. However, when used in conjunction with other cross-sectional imaging and knowledge of the nodal distribution, extranodal findings, epidemiology, and clinical presentation, FDG-PET/CT can help considerably in narrowing this differential diagnosis. And while currently limited in practice, FDG-PET/CT has the potential to play an increasingly larger role in patients with known causes for diffuse lymphadenopathy in terms of assessment of disease extent and treatment efficacy as well as in regard to treatment planning.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114w4sqo]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in the clinical course of RA and has been reported in up to 82% of patients. Lymphadenopathy in RA tends to be predominantly localized, with preferential involvement of lymph nodes near joints with active arthritis, but swollen lymph nodes tend to be larger than in SLE, with a diameter commonly > 1cm. This anatomical localization likely reflects the role of lymph nodes and lymphatics in the pathophysiology of inflammatory erosive arthritis. Albeit infrequent, generalized lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms has been described at the onset of RA. Not surprisingly, the most affected region is the axilla, as it drains afferent lymphatics from the upper limbs joints. Presence of lymphadenopathy has been correlated with both local and systemic disease activity, specifically correlating with number of tender and swollen joints, higher CRP levels, higher Simple Disease Activity Index, and higher frequency of RA-related interstitial lung disease. Moreover, alterations of sonographic pattern at Power Doppler signal of axillary lymph nodes were found to correlate with US synovitis degree of affected joints. The role of 18F-FDG-PET, despite being useful in monitoring disease severity and treatment response in RA, is not established in the assessment of lymphadenopathy in RA, as increased tracer uptake may mimic lymphoma. Similar to what is reported in SLE, lymphadenopathy tends to be responsive to anti-inflammatory treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, with improvement correlating with remission of synovitis. The response to anti-TNF treatment assessed clinically and at synovial US was demonstrated to correlate with improvement in lymph node Power Doppler scores. Interestingly, the subset of patients with a lower number of lymph nodes involved and lower perfusion scores at baseline despite active arthritis significantly correlate with poorer response to TNF blockade. At histology, RA lymphadenopathy is characterized by marked follicular hyperplasia with possible neutrophilic infiltrate in sinuses and interfollicular areas. After immunosuppressive therapy, follicular hyperplasia regresses and interfollicular and paracortical areas become hyperplastic. Although this is not included in diagnostic guidelines, presence of lymphadenopathy may be an additional tool to differentiate between RA and PsA, as it is significantly more frequent in the former.

Rheumatologic diseases with lymphadenopathy

Systemic lupus erythematosus

Epidemiological data reported a prevalence of lymphadenopathy in SLE patients ranging from 33% to 69%. Enlarged lymph nodes in SLE tend to be soft and non-tender, more often with a diameter < 1 cm, which is below the threshold for being considered enlarged by many physicians. Lymphadenopathy is more frequently reported as generalized, while localized lymphadenopathy has been described in up to 25% of cases and is most frequently observed in younger patients, in the context of an active disease. Lymphadenopathy in SLE patients has indeed been correlated with higher frequency of constitutional symptoms, cutaneous involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, increased titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies and lower complement levels. Moreover, lymphadenopathy tends to resolve with steroid therapy. Although lymphadenopathy may rarely represent the initial presenting sign of SLE, it is not included in SLE classification criteria. Increased lymph node 18F-FDG uptake at PET/CT has been described in few SLE cases, however its interpretation represents a significant challenge as it potentially mimicks lymphoma. The histological findings in lymph node specimens are usually nonspecific and consist of follicular hyperplasia associated with increased vascularity and scattered immunoblasts and plasma cells. The most specific but variably present histological finding is coagulative necrosis with haematoxylin bodies (amorphous aggregates of periodic acid–Schiff-positive basophilic material) or reactive follicular hyperplasia; this presentation is rarely seen. Some lesions may be similar to the hyaline-vascular or mixed histopathological subtypes of CD. Given the clinical overlap between SLE and multicentric CD (MCD), having overlapping histopathological features presents a challenge to making an accurate diagnosis. Similarly, an important differential diagnosis is Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, another condition with histological presentation highly reminiscent of SLE that can be found in association with SLE.

### Toxoplasmosis in a patient receiving ixekizumab for psoriasis [^116izhd5]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

Our patient presented with a 3-month history of dry cough and rhinorrhea associated with tender left axillary lymphadenopathy. She had a history of chronic plaque psoriasis without joint disease since the age of 17 years, affecting her scalp, face, elbows, trunk, knees, and genital region. She was receiving treatment with ixekizumab at a dose of 80 mg every month. She also had a history of depression. She was not receiving any other medications. The patient denied owning cats but did report consuming rare meat regularly. She had no other risk factors for toxoplasmosis.

Serologic testing was positive for anti- Toxoplasma immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG), with a Toxoplasma IgG index of 79.80 (> 8.79 = positive), a Toxoplasma IgM index of 50.00 (> 7.99 = positive), and a low Toxoplasma avidity index of 0.06 (< 0.20 = low). Results of additional serologic investigations were negative, including those for HIV, cytomegalovirus, Bartonella, Epstein-Barr virus, and Q fever. Ultrasonography of the left axilla demonstrated an enlarged axillary lymph node with a thickened hypoechoic cortex, consistent with a reactive lymph node. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed. Histopathologic features were in keeping with reactive adenopathy most likely caused by toxoplasmosis, without evidence of necrosis or lymphoid atypia (Fig 1).

The patient attended the infectious diseases clinic for further evaluation. Serial paired serology demonstrated an increasing IgG titre, a declining IgM titre, and a low Toxoplasma IgG avidity index, supportive of recent primary infection. Owing to concern for disseminated Toxoplasma infection in an immunocompromised patient, a 14-day treatment course with pyrimethamine, leucovorin, and clindamycin was completed. Our patient remains without recurrence of lymphadenopathy and Toxoplasma infection 5 years posttreatment. She continues to follow up in the dermatology clinic every 3 months while on ixekizumab.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^117LKYV7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Other glandular abnormalities — benign-appearing endometrial and glandular cells: Approximately 0.5% to 1.8% of cervical cytology specimens from women 40 years old and older will have endometrial cells. Benign-appearing exfoliated endometrial cells in premenopausal women identified during either the first or the second half of the menstrual cycle are rarely associated with significant pathology, whereas benign-appearing endometrial cells in postmenopausal women are not infrequently associated with significant endometrial pathology. In a study of postmenopausal women with benign-appearing endometrial cells on routine cytology who underwent endometrial biopsy, 8% had significant pathology identified including endometrial adenocarcinoma in 5% of the women. After total hysterectomy, benign-appearing glandular cells derived from small accessory ducts, foci of benign adenosis, or prolapse of the fallopian tube into the vagina have no clinical significance.

### FDG-PET / CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^114vSZkP]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Fig. 6
a Axial PET/CT image depicts bilateral symmetrical areas of avid FDG uptake in the supraclavicular regions (arrows). These may be confused for metastatic supraclavicular adenopathy. b Corresponding axial CECT image detects no focal abnormality in the supraclavicular regions (arrows). Note that the areas of high uptake seen in a correspond to low attenuation fatty tissue (arrows) in b

Often the clinical history points to the cause of FDG uptake; however, inflammatory conditions (such as periodontal disease, dental infection, active atherosclerotic plaques or tuberculosis) and neoplastic disease can coexist. Reactive nodes are commonly encountered in the head and neck, and may result in a decreased specificity of FDG-PET/CT for the nodal staging of head and neck cancers. Precise image fusion, correlation of PET with morphological CT findings and 2D multiplanar reconstructions are essential in order to avoid overdiagnosis of benign conditions as malignancy, as well as missing out on actual pathology. Evaluation of SUVs may help to differentiate between benign and malignant disease, whereby SUVs greater than 3 are considered as a general guide to indicate neoplasm. Nevertheless, SUVs greater than 3 can also occur in acute infection, such as sinusitis, osteomyelitis, suppurative lymphadenopathy and abscess. If diagnostic dilemma still exists, sequential follow-up imaging, US examination of the neck and, at times, US FNAC may be needed.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^116YAGyp]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

PGL is FDG-avid on PET/CT as a by-product of the energy-dependent process of lymphocyte activation in HIV infection (Fig. 2b, c). Lymph node activation occurs in a predictable anatomic sequence in HIV patients, seen as a progressive craniocaudal pattern of FDG uptake in affected lymph nodes. Increasing viremia and lower CD4 counts correlate with more widespread lymphadenopathy and advancement in this nodal spread from the upper to lower torso. In this capacity, FDG-PET/CT serves as a marker for current HIV activity and disease burden. This pattern, however, has only been confirmed in antiretroviral (ART)-naïve patients.

The degree of FDG uptake on PET/CT in HIV-reactive lymph nodes is directly related to viral load and inversely proportional to CD4 count. One study cited a median nodal maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 3.7 for PGL in patients with undetectable viral loads compared with 6.0 in those without viremia. Consequently, reliably differentiating reactive nodal uptake from other causes of lymphadenopathy — most importantly, malignancy — becomes quite limited in patients with higher viremia, as there is a concomitant rise in the SUV max of reactive nodes. This is problematic when one considers the increased risk of malignancy associated with HIV infection. Controlling a patient's viremia prior to imaging thus represents an important strategy in decreasing the incidence of indeterminate findings on PET/CT.

Adding to the complexity of FDG-PET/CT interpretation in HIV patients is the possibility of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a temporary paradoxical clinical worsening of underlying malignancy and/or opportunistic infection that occurs in 10–20% of HIV patients following ART initiation. This clinical deterioration manifests on PET/CT as a worsening of imaging findings, including increasing FDG uptake. Differentiation of IRIS from progression of underlying pathology or development of malignancy is difficult in the acute setting. Therefore, follow-up imaging is crucial.

### Validity and reliability of transbronchial needle aspiration for diagnosing mediastinal adenopathies [^115TSggP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In general, when TBNA is performed, three different situations occur: 1) enough sample is obtained to make a specific cytologic or histologic diagnosis; 2) inadequate or insufficient sample is obtained; or 3) enough sample is obtained for cytology or biopsy (abundant lymphoid cellularity) but it is impossible to affirm whether is the sample is representative of the pathology suspected. In most studies, samples that provided a specific diagnosis were considered TPs, given the high PPV ascribed to the technique. However, there is substantial disagreement about the definitions of FN and TN in the literature; in some studies, only adequate samples were included in the analysis which resulted in overestimation of the validity and reliability of TBNA. In other studies, non-adequate samples that were verified but did not have lymphoid cellularity were considered TNs and not FNs. In still other studies, the definition of FN was based on the influence that the TBNA result had in the final decision about patient management. In 15–25% of TBNAs, a representative sample is obtained but a specific diagnosis cannot be made. For example, if the patient has a carcinoma, it is possible to find a TN (normal or reactive node) or a FN (metastatic adenopathy, although not appearing in cytologic smears or in biopsies obtained by TBNA). In one recent study, the frequency of such cases was 24%. In our opinion, when the sample is inadequate (a few lymphocytes, mucus, blood, bronchial wall cells, few atypic cells, or not enough tissue sample), the sample should be considered a FN because the cellularity does not represent that of the node. Nevertheless, some authors consider that inadequate samples should not be included when evaluating TBNA validity and reliability as a diagnostic tool. TN designations should be reserved for patients with specific pathologies for whom TBNA results were representative of a lymphatic node puncture and the diagnosis was confirmed by other techniques.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting IgG4-RD, being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limbs oedema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized and the most commonly involved lymph node stations are mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical and inguinal. Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts. First, enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features. Second, lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease. Third, lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after diagnosis of extranodal disease. Fourth, generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears. Recently, IgG4-RD has been arrayed into four clinical phenotypes, based on the observation of patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are: (group 1) pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients), (group 2) retroperitoneum and aorta (24%), (group 3) head and neck–limited (24%) and (group 4) Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement (22%). Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of frequency (second most common organ involved after submandibular gland). On the other hand, group 1 features the lowest frequency with 15%, while group 2 and 3 display lymphadenopathy in roughly 25% of cases. At the microscopic level, lymph nodes can express five types of histologic pattern, all characterized by increased accumulation of IgG4+ plasma cells and by a IgG4/IgG ratio > 40% at immunohistochemistry. Pattern 1 is highly reminiscent of the plasmacytic histopathological subtype of MCD and is characterized by intact nodal architecture with hyperplastic follicles as well as follicles with some degree of germinal centre regression and possible penetration by venules. The interfollicular space displays increased high endothelial venules and abundant plasma cells. Pattern 2 shows a typical reactive follicular hyperplasia, encountered in other autoimmune diseases such as SLE and RA. Pattern 3 is characterized by normal or variably regressed follicles with marked expansion of the interfollicular space. This area is filled by prominent high endothelial venules, immunoblasts, small lymphocytes plasma cells and eosinophils. Pattern 4 is notable for the presence of 'transformed' germinal centres, two to four times larger than those of background follicles, which become ameboid or stellate shaped. Their follicles display a thickened mantle zone with inward protrusions into germinal centres. Pattern 5, known as 'inflammatory pseudotumor-like', is the least common and is characterized by replacement of the nodal parenchyma by sclero-hyaline tissue. Collagen fibers in this context may organize into a storiform pattern similar to that observed in other organ involved by IgG4-RD. Importantly, histological patterns may not be fully discriminating and specimens may contain more than one pattern at a time (Fig. 1).

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. < 38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. > 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. 'Red flags' for malignancy are a diameter > 1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### A study of patients with isolated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy undergoing EBUS-TBNA [^111LYFGa]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isolated mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy (IMHL) is a relatively common reason for respiratory physician referral in the UK. The differential diagnosis includes benign granulomatous disorders, for example, tuberculosis (TB) and sarcoidosis, and malignancy, including lymphoma and metastatic carcinoma. Rarer causes include lymphoproliferative disorders, for example, Castleman's disease, primary hypogammaglobulinaemiaand histoplasmosis. Lymph nodes may also enlarge as a reaction to underlying comorbidities, when a designation of 'reactive' lymphadenopathy may be made. Reactive lymphadenopathy has been associated with a number of chronic conditions, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, heart failureand connective tissue disease. Mediastinal lymph node enlargement has been reported to be present in half of the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in one series, irrespective of the degree of airflow obstruction, and between 35% and 66% in patients with severe chronic cardiac failure, where lymphadenopathy may be secondary to raised left atrial filling pressures resulting in increased lymphatic fluid.

Pathological/microbiological confirmation is recommended in patients with IMHL to ensure appropriate treatment. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been shown to be highly effective in the diagnosis of granulomatous IMHL and nodal staging in lung cancer. The sensitivity for lymphoma is lower as larger tissue samples are often required. The REMEDY trial, the only prospective study of EBUS-TBNA in patients with IMHL requiring pathological confirmation, demonstrated high sensitivity (92%) and cost-effectiveness of EBUS-TBNA as a first-line investigation, preventing mediastinoscopy in 87% of patients. However, of 10 patients (10/77, 13%) with a negative EBUS-TBNA, 6 were false negatives, giving a negative predictive value (NPV) of 40%. The authors therefore recommended mediastinoscopy in cases of negative EBUS-TBNA sampling. Of note, however, was the low prevalence of reactive lymphadenopathy (5%) in this study, possibly reflecting the highly selected nature of the population.

The aims of our study were to investigate the causes of IMHL in patients referred to our centre for EBUS-TBNA and determine the diagnostic performance, in particular the NPV, of EBUS-TBNA in this population. In addition, we wanted to prospectively explore clinically measurable variables that could be used to differentiate the reactive from the pathological causes of IMHL.

### Cytogenetic findings in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia: significance of non-clonal T (3; 14) and T (3; 22) [^113gp2x3]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite several reports of the molecular detection of recurrent lymphoma translocations in reactive lymph nodes (LN), cytogenetic analysis is seldom performed on such cases. We report the clinical and cytogenetic analysis results on 30 reactive LN. Of these, 17 cases yielded either no growth (n = 9) or normal metaphases only (n = 8), and seven of the 17 patients subsequently developed lymphoma. Lymphoma developed in all 10 patients with a clonal karyotype (median of 2.6 months). Three patients (1 HIV-positive) had non-clonal t(3;14) or t(3;22). Their lymphadenopathy resolved spontaneously, and none progressed to lymphoma at 4–6 years of follow-up. Molecular methods detected a small B-cell clone in one case and an oligoclonal B-cell population in the other. Cytogenetic analysis may be useful for interpreting cases of lymphoid hyperplasia. A clonal abnormality is highly predictive of concurrent and/or subsequent lymphoma. A lymphoma-specific but non-clonal abnormality does not necessarily herald the development of subsequent lymphoma.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Differentiation of HIV-associated lymphoma from HIV-associated reactive adenopathy using quantitative FDG PET and symmetry [^117Rz9ok]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a semiautomated (18)F-FDG PET/CT measurement of total lesion glycolysis (TLG), maximum and peak standardized uptake value at lean body mass (SUL-Max and SUL-Peak), qualitative estimates of left/right nodal symmetry and FDG uptake for differentiating lymphoma from reactive adenopathy in HIV-infected patients.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 41 whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies performed in HIV-infected patients for clinical reasons. The study received institutional review board approval. Of the 41 patients, 19 had biopsy-proven untreated lymphoma, and 22 with reactive adenopathy without malignancy on follow-up were used as controls. Nodal and extranodal visual qualitative metabolic scores, SUL-Max, SUL-Peak, CT nodal size, and PERCIST 1.0 threshold-based TLG and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were determined. The qualitative intensity of nodal involvement and symmetry of uptake were compared using receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. HIV plasma viral RNA measurements were also obtained.

Results

All of the quantitative PET metrics performed well in differentiating lymphoma from reactive adenopathy and performed better than qualitative visual intensity scores. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were significantly higher for TLG = 0.96, single SUL-Peak = 0.96, single SUL-Max = 0.97, and MTV = 0.96, compared to 0.67 for CT nodal size (p < 0.001). These PET metrics performed best in separating the two populations in aviremic patients, with AUCs of 1 (AUC 0.91 for CT nodal size). TLG, MTV, SUL-Peak and SUL-Max were more reliable markers among viremic individuals, with AUCs between 0.84 and 0.93, compared to other metrics. PET metrics were significantly correlated with plasma viral load in HIV-reactive adenopathy controls. Asymmetrical FDG uptake had an accuracy of 90.4% for differentiating lymphoma from reactive adenopathy in HIV-infected patients.

Conclusion

Quantitative PET metabolic metrics as well as the qualitative assessment of symmetry of nodal uptake appear to be valuable tools for differentiating lymphoma from reactive adenopathy in HIV-infected patients using FDG PET. These parameters appear more robust in aviremic patients.

18F-FDG-PET enables clinicians to stage organ involvement, to select an amenable biopsy site, and to monitor response to treatment. However, PET is not able to distinguish IgG4-related lymphadenopathy from reactive lymphadenopathy.

The presence of IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration in lymph nodes is not specific for IgG4-RD. In fact, isolated lymph nodes with IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration and a compatible histological pattern is not enough to establish a diagnosis of IgG4-RD, even after exclusion of potential disease mimickers, as presence of extranodal disease is required. The diagnosis of IgG4-RD requires a multimodality approach in which target organ involvement evaluated clinically and radiologically needs to be supported by laboratory and histological evidence as well as by exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Differential diagnosis of IgG4-related lymphadenopathy is broad and mainly includes lymphoproliferative disorders, MCD, Ebstein–Barr related lymphadenopathy, sarcoidosis, Rosai Dorfman disease and unspecific reactive lymphadenopathy. Patients with IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration in lymph nodes need to be followed up strictly as they may develop extranodal involvement and be most appropriately diagnosed with IgG4-RD. Lymphadenopathy has been recently described as a clinical marker of poor prognosis, associated with higher disease activity relapse rate.

Background

Isolated mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy (IMHL) may be caused by benign and malignant disorders or be 'reactive'. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has a reported low negative predictive value (NPV) in IMHL, necessitating mediastinoscopy in selected patients. The aim of this study was to examine the NPV of EBUS-TBNA in an IMHL population and determine whether clinical variables differentiate between pathological and reactive IMHL.

Methods

Analysis of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive patients with IMHL referred to a single UK centre for EBUS-TBNA.

Results

100 patients with IMHL had EBUS-TBNA during the study (March 2010–February 2013), mean age 58.6 ± 15.7 years, 63% men, 70% white British and mean follow-up 16.8 ± 8.6 months. Pathological cause of IMHL established in 52 patients (sarcoidosis n = 20, tuberculosis n = 18, carcinoma n = 7, lymphoma n = 6, benign cyst n = 1), 43 from EBUS-TBNA. 48/57 negative EBUS-TBNA samples were true negatives reflecting reactive lymphadenopathy in 48%. The diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA was 91% and NPV was 84.2% (95% CI 72.6% to 91.5%). Multivariate analysis of clinical covariates showed age (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13; p = 0.033), the presence of a relevant comorbidity (OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.20 to 41.04; p = 0.003) and maximum lymph node size (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; p = 0.00004) to differentiate between reactive and pathological IMHL. Stratification of the study population according to comorbidity and maximum lymph node size (< 20 mm) identified a low-risk cohort (n = 32) where the NPV of EBUS-TBNA was 93.8% (95% CI 79.9% to 98.3%).

Conclusions

Reactive lymphadenopathy accounts for a significant proportion of patients with IMHL. In carefully selected patients with IMHL and a negative EBUS-TBNA, surveillance rather than further invasive sampling may be an appropriate strategy.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^114rV41X]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymphadenopathy represents an abnormality in nodal size, number, shape, and/or signal on imaging and is characterized as localized or diffuse. Diffuse lymphadenopathy is a common, non-specific imaging finding, which has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes malignant and benign etiologies. As part of the work-up, many patients undergo 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]fluoro — glucose ([18 F]FDG) positive emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), mainly for ruling out malignancy. FDG-avid lymph nodes, however, are not specific for malignancy. Inflammatory cells avidly take up FDG when undergoing the energy-dependent process of activation. To meet this energy — and thus glucose — demand, inflammatory cells increase their expression of cell-surface glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, and key glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase (Fig. 1). PET/CT exploits these metabolic changes to image inflammatory/infectious disorders in which there is abnormal accumulation of hypermetabolic inflammatory cells.

Fig. 1.
Energy-dependent process of inflammatory cell activation. With activation, inflammatory cells increase their expression of cell surface glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, and key glycolytic enzymes, particularly hexokinase, altogether allowing for increased glucose uptake and utilization. Similarly, [18 F]FDG, a radiolabeled glucose analog, is taken up by and trapped within activated inflammatory cells at higher rates, which PET/CT exploits in imaging inflammatory disorders.

Due to its lack of specificity, FDG-PET/CT cannot definitively rule in a disease process as a cause of diffuse lymphadenopathy. However, it can be used in conjunction with other cross-sectional imaging, clinical history, and epidemiology to narrow this differential diagnosis. This review will illustrate the wide spectrum of findings in patients who exhibit nodal uptake on FDG-PET/CT. Select infectious, inflammatory, and benign lymphoproliferative etiologies will be discussed (Table 1).

### Imaging of cervical lymphadenopathy in children and young adults [^116sgVwj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This article describes the role of imaging in evaluating cervical lymphadenopathy in patients from birth to their mid-20s, illustrates imaging features of normal and abnormal lymph nodes, and highlights nodal imaging features and head and neck findings that assist in diagnosis.

Conclusion

Cervical lymph node abnormalities are commonly encountered clinically and on imaging in children and young adults. Although imaging findings can lack specificity, nodal characteristics and associated head and neck imaging findings can assist in determining the underlying cause.

Imaging

Typical manifestations

Chest HRCT is recommended for the initial imaging evaluation of CVID patients with suspected ILD. Patients with CVID may have several presentations on HRCT: 1) No evidence of lung involvement; 2) CVID-related airways disease, characterized by airway thickening, bronchiectasis, mucus plugs and tree-in-bud nodularity; 3) GLILD; and 4) other interstitial lung disease, including organizing pneumonia (OP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Typical GLILD CT findings include pulmonary nodularity, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening, typically with lower lung and peribronchovascular predominance, (Fig. 2 a and b). The pulmonary nodules may be solid, ground-glass or mixed density, and a ground-glass halo may be present around solid nodules. Notably, GLILD almost always manifests with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, which may increase the confidence of radiological diagnosis.,

Fig. 2
(a) Typical HRCT findings of GLILD; coronal (left) and axial (right) images show lower lung predominant ground glass abnormality and consolidation, with scattered nodules. Splenomegaly and adenopathy are present (arrows). (b) Findings compatible with GLILD; coronal (left) and axial (right) images show patchy lower lung ground glass abnormality. Nodules are not present. Splenomegaly and adenopathy are present (arrows). (c) Findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis; coronal (left) and axial (right) images show upper lung predominant perilymphatic nodules with areas of conglomeration in a patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Spleen size is normal. (d) Interstitial inflammatory infiltrates composed predominantly of small mature lymphocytes and scattered lymphoid aggregates, some of which contain reactive germinal centers (insert), that widens the alveolar walls. The right lower corner inset is a high magnification view showing a reactive germinal center. (e) Lower magnification view of (d) showing lymphoid hyperplasia with nodular to irregular distribution. (f) Granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes. (g) Follicular bronchiolitis characterized by the presence of bronchiolocentric lymphoid follicles with germinal centers.

A subset of patients with GLILD may present with pulmonary fibrosis, with findings of reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and pulmonary volume loss. Similar to other forms of non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the presence of pulmonary fibrosis, especially if it is progressive, is associated with worse prognosis compared to non-fibrotic cases.

### Lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination with increased FDG uptake may be falsely attributed to oncological disorders: a systematic review [^112R1Lic]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic that continues to cause numerous deaths to date. Four vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of July 2021 to prevent the transmission of COVID-19: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen. These vaccines have shown great efficacy and safety profile. One side effect that has been widely reported is post-COVID-19 vaccination lymphadenopathy. Due to the mimicry of the lymphadenopathy for metastases in some oncologic patients, there have been reports of patients who underwent biopsies that showed pathologic confirmation of benign reactive lymphadenopathy secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, understanding the incidence of lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccinations will help guide radiologists and oncologists in their management of patients, both present oncologic patients, and patients with concerns over their newly presenting lymphadenopathy. A systematic literature search was performed using several databases to identify relevant studies that reported lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination. Our results revealed that several cases have been detected in patients undergoing follow-up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography-computerized tomography scans where lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection site show increased uptake of FDG. Thus, knowledge of the incidence of lymphadenopathy may help avoid unnecessary biopsies, interventions, and changes in management for patients, especially oncologic patients who are at risk for malignancies.

Diagnostic Testing

Question 1: Should Lymph Node Sampling Be Performed in a Patient Presenting with Asymptomatic Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy?

Rationale for question

Isolated involvement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a common presentation of sarcoidosis, and is readily detected by a routine chest X-ray. Many such patients are asymptomatic, and sarcoidosis is only suspected on the basis of radiographic testing for an unrelated reason. Patients with sarcoidosis with asymptomatic lymph node involvement generally have self-limited disease, and do not require treatment. However, the finding of enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes during radiographic testing is often alarming to healthcare providers and patients alike, primarily out of concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as occult malignancy or latent infection. Previous studies have reported that asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is almost always caused by sarcoidosis, and, given the benign nature of this phenotype, there is clinical equipoise for pursuing diagnostic sampling in such patients.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 2,106 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 75 was reviewed. One study reported enrolling patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so the panel decided to separately consider 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis. The study that enrolled patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy confirmed sarcoidosis in 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 61–81%), but found lymphoma in 10% (95% CI, 5.3–19%) and other diagnoses (i.e. nonlymphomatous malignancy, silicosis, fibrosis, and amyloidosis) in 7.7% (95% CI, 3.6–15.8%). The 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis collectively included 556 patients who underwent at least 1 sampling procedure. Sarcoidosis was confirmed in 85% (95% CI, 82–88%) of patients, an alternative diagnosis was made in 1.9% (95% CI, 1–3.7%) of patients, and sampling was nondiagnostic in 11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of patients. Among the alternative diagnoses, 38% (95% CI, 14–69%) were TB and 25% (95% CI, 7.1–59%) were lymphoma. The only complication reported was a case of mediastinitis that occurred after an esophageal endoscopic ultrasound procedure.

### Active pulmonary tuberculosis: something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue [^114qj2qE]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Lower lobe disease, adenopathy, and pleural effusions are common in children but less common in adults. These findings therefore became known as atypical disease in adults, whilst the upper lobe disease observed in most adults became known as typical reactivation tuberculosis. The term "atypical" might be misleading because certain patterns are in fact typical for the immunocompromised status. Although most tuberculosis cases in immunocompromised individuals are related to reactivation of latent tuberculosis, the radiological and clinical manifestations more frequently resemble primary TB. Upper lobe cavitary disease is usually seen in infected immunocompetent hosts, whereas immunocompromised patients often present with lower-lung disease, adenopathy and effusions. In the paediatric population of active TB, an upper lobe predominant distribution was identified in 36–82% of cases which was associated with lymphadenopathy in up to 15% of cases. Imaging appearances of active PTB are independent of the time since infection and thus cannot differentiate primary from post-primary TB. In fact, the advances in molecular epidemiology in the 1990s have led to the discovery that the radiographic appearances of TB depends on immune status and therefore the suggested terminology for TB infection is "active TB".

Tuberculoma represents a pulmonary nodule and may be the only abnormality seen on chest radiographs in approximately 5% of patients with active TB. Satellite nodules around the tuberculoma, with typically smooth, sharply defined margins, may be present in up to 80% of cases. When solitary, active tuberculomas may be mistaken for malignancy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
A 37-year-old female had a routine chest radiograph (a) which demonstrated a solitary pulmonary nodule in the left mid zone (arrow). CT (lung window, axial plane — (b) confirms the presence of a 27 mm nodule in the lingula (arrow) with adjacent tiny satellite nodules (arrowheads) but no lymphadenopathy. Sputum smears were negative but TB culture from bronchoalveolar lavage was positive for M. Tuberculosis

### Imaging of head and neck lymph nodes [^114L7e9y]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The cervical lymph nodes can be affected by a variety of infectious, inflammatory, benign, and malignant pathologic conditions. Clinical history and physical examination with the complementary use of imaging is essential to accurately make a diagnosis or appropriate differential. Knowledge of cervical lymph node anatomy, drainage pathways, morphologic variations, and common nodal pathology is key to correct interpretation of cervical lymph nodes on imaging. Computed tomography (CT), MR, ultrasound, and PET/CT are complementary imaging modalities that can be used in the evaluation of cervical lymph node pathology.

### Validity and reliability of transbronchial needle aspiration for diagnosing mediastinal adenopathies [^112T3cGA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Data interpretation

All samples with high lymphoid cellularity (at least 30%) suggesting a lymph node puncture or the existence of many neoplastic cells or cytological/histological findings that allowed for a specific diagnosis ("diagnostic samples") were considered "adequate samples". Samples with atypias or dubious, mucousy, bloody, or tracheobronchial wall cellularity were considered "non-adequate".

In all patients with TBNA performed in more than one lymph node station, the best diagnosis or the most adequate, if there was disagreement, was selected. Every patient was considered as an analysis unit.

All diagnostic samples, those with abundant lymphoid cellularity confirmed by a surgical technique, and those with benign pathology that did not change or disappeared after six months were considered true positives (TP). TPs were not further confirmed by a surgical technique due to the very high specificity of TBNA; false positives (FP) are extremely infrequent. Cases yielding only a very high lymphoid cellularity in patients with specific pathologies such as carcinomas, lymphomas, tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis, and whose surgical biopsies produced results similar to those of TBNA were considered true negatives (TN). The samples with lymphoid cellularity not confirmed by surgical techniques or follow-up and all patients with non-adequate TBNAs were considered false negatives (FNs).

The diagnosis of carcinoma or lymphoma was made according to standard criteria. Sarcoidosis was diagnosed when sarcoid granulomas were found and other diseases with similar clinical or radiologic findings could be reasonably excluded. Tuberculosis was diagnosed when the cytohistologic samples showed necrotizing granulomas with or without Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolation and the patient had a good response to antituberculosis treatment. Anthracotic or reactive adenopathies were diagnosed according to clinical criteria, occupational exposure, cytohistologic results (numerous benign lymphocytes and resolution of patient process or few lymphocytes plus numerous anthracotic pigment-laden macrophages), and clinical-radiologic follow-up (stabilization or disappearance of the nodes), and were considered non-specific pathologies.

Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical parameters to differentiate between reactive and pathological lymphadenopathy

Patients were then stratified into a 'low risk' of pathological IMHL, defined as the presence of at least one comorbidity and a maximum lymph node diameter of less than 20 mm, and high risk defined as the absence of comorbidity and a maximum lymph node diameter greater than 20 mm. Age was excluded because patients with malignancy were not of a significantly different age to patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (figure 2). A total of 32 patients were categorised as low risk, which included 30 patients with reactive lymphadenopathy, 1 patient with TB and 1 patient with sarcoidosis. This compared with 68 patients categorised as high risk, which included 50 patients with a pathological cause and 18 patients with a reactive cause of IMHL. The sensitivity and specificity of this model was 96.2% and 62.5%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 73.5% and NPV 93.8% (95% CI 79.9% to 98.3%).

### Radiology of castleman disease: the pivotal role of imaging in diagnosis, staging, and response assessment of this rare entity [^112oJwfj]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Castleman Disease (CD) is a rare entity that typically presents as an enhancing nodal mass in the mediastinum or head and neck region on computed tomography (CT). It may manifest as unicentric or multicentric regions of lymph node enlargement. A key clinical issue in the context of CD is delayed diagnosis, which contributes adversely to patient outcome, given that accurate diagnosis facilitates earlier treatment of this curable disease. This article will address relevant imaging aspects, with reference to typical and atypical imaging features of CD, illustrated using examples from our specialist centre; the imaging journey for patients with CD; and will provide practical pointers to radiologists in differentiating CD from other benign and malignant causes of enhancing lymphadenopathy, including lymphoma and neoplastic adenopathy. We will also review current classification tools and staging challenges with reference to World Health Organization guidelines, International Working Group guidelines as well as the Lugano classification. Finally, we will discuss the potential role of additional imaging techniques in CD, highlighting novel imaging methods and expanded utilities from our specialist centre.

### Atypical lymphoid hyperplasia mimicking lymphoma [^116uRcvM]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The distinction between reactive and neoplastic lymphoid infiltrates is a common problem in clinical practice and can be problematic. The clinical implications for both the patient and the treating clinician are profound. In this article, we discuss six of the common entities that can present as atypical lymphoid hyperplasia and thus can mimic malignant lymphomas, with emphasis on morphologic features, immunophenotypic findings, and molecular correlates that help distinguish these disorders from neoplastic conditions. The six conditions to be discussed in detail include reactive follicular hyperplasia versus follicular lymphoma; progressive transformation of germinal centers versus nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma; immunoblastic proliferations versus diffuse large B-cell lymphomas; variant forms of Castleman disease that may mimic a number of lymphoid cancers; Kikuchi's disease versus large cell lymphomas; and finally, dermatopathic lymphadenopathy and its distinction from lymph nodes showing early involvement by cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Mycosis fungoides).

### Preoperative distinction of parotid lymphomas [^117XbSUr]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical parotidectomies place parotid lymphoma patients at increased risk of morbidity because of the diffuse infiltrative nature of the disease. These tumors usually respond to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but are difficult to distinguish from other benign parotid gland tumors preoperatively. We sought to identify clinical and radiologic features that could aid in the preoperative distinction of parotid lymphomas.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective chart review of 248 superficial parotidectomy patients.

Results

Of 248 parotid lesions, 22 (8.8%) were lymphomas (21 non-Hodgkin's, 1 Hodgkin's). The lymphoma cases included four patients with a history of autoimmune disease, and four with a previous diagnosis of lymphoma. Palpable painless masses were present in all cases (14 right, 7 left, 1 bilateral). Two patients had multiple palpable parotid nodules and five had palpable cervical adenopathy. Of 17 patients receiving preoperative CT scans, 4 more patients were revealed to have bilateral disease, 7 more patients had cervical adenopathy, and 5 more patients had multiple parotid nodules. Tumors were poorly circumscribed in 7 of 17 (41%), and diffuse parotid changes were noted in 2. Preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed in 10 of the 22 lymphomas, revealing 3 reactive nodes, 3 suspicious for lymphoma and 3 nondiagnostic.

Conclusions

Although parotid lymphomas are uncommon, a history of autoimmune disease or previous lymphoma; clinical or radiologic evidence of bilateral, multiple, or poorly circumscribed parotid lesions; and cervical lymphadenopathy should suggest this diagnosis. This may alter the proposed surgery and decrease the potential morbidity associated with superficial parotidectomy in cases of parotid lymphoma.

### Abstract… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY Because the upper extremities that axillary lymph nodes drain are commonly exposed to local infection and injury, most axillary lymphadenopathy is nonspecific or reactive in etiology. Infectious sources of prolonged lymphadenopathy such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis rarely manifest with lymphadenopathy alone. INGUINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY Inguinal lymphadenopathy is common, with nodes enlarged up to 1 to 2 cm in diameter in many healthy adults, particularly those who spend time barefoot outdoors. 19 Benign reactive lymphadenopathy and infection are the most common etiologies, and inguinal lymphadenopathy is of low suspicion for malignancy. GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as lymphadenopathy found in two or more distinct anatomic regions, is more likely than localized adenopathy to result from serious infections, autoimmune diseases, and disseminated malignancy. It usually merits specific testing.

Common benign causes include adenoviral illness in children, mononucleosis, and some pharmaceuticals, and these can usually be identified with a careful history and examination. Generalized adenopathy infrequently occurs in patients with neoplasms, but it is occasionally seen in patients with leukemias and lymphomas, or advanced disseminated metastatic solid tumors. Hodgkin's lymphoma and most metastatic carcinomas typically progress through nodes in anatomic sequence. Patients who are immunocompromised and those with AIDS have a wide differential for generalized lymphadenopathy, including early human immunodeficiency virus infection, activated tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and Kaposi's sarcoma, which can present with lymphadenopathy before visible skin lesions appear.
22. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is non-specific but typically represents nodal inflammation from an infection.

In rare cases, painful or tender lymphadenopathy can result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a neoplastic node or from pressure on the nodal capsule caused by rapid tumor expansion. Lymphadenopathy is classically described as a node larger than 1 cm, although this varies by lymphatic region. Palpable supraclavicular, iliac, or popliteal nodes of any size and epitrochlear nodes larger than 5 mm are considered abnormal.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^1111EHYk]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

IgG4-RD can affect nearly any organ except synovial tissue. This "fibro-inflammatory" disease presents with tumefactive (puffy) inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis with a predilection for glandular tissue. Figure 1 illustrates the manifestations of IgG4-RD by organ system. The most common organ manifestations from two large cohorts, one Japanese and one American, are shown in Table 1. In patients presenting with the better-known features of IgG4-RD, such as autoimmune pancreatitis, orbital disease and major salivary gland involvement, the disease tends to be recognized and histologically confirmed earlier, but patients referred to hematologists may present with less obvious features of IgG4-RD, and a high index of suspicion is needed to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Common reasons for referral to a hematologist include lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Figure 1.
Manifestations of IgG4-related disease by organ system. The most common primary disease features are indicated in bold.

Table 1.
Clinical characteristics of patients from two large published cohorts.

Lymphadenopathy

IgG4-related lymphadenopathy is one of the three most common manifestations of IgG4-RD, affecting 30–60% of patients with IgG4-RD in most large cohorts (Table 1). IgG4-lymphadenompathy may be generalized or localized (the latter typically contiguous with involved organs such as pancreas and lungs). Parallel enlargement of salivary, lacrimal and parotid glands is common. Five morphological subtypes, all of which display increased IgG4 + plasma cells, have been described (see Figure 2 for examples): –
Multicentric Castleman disease-like: preserved nodal architecture with patent sinusoids and hyperplastic follicles; abundant mature plasma cells in interfollicular areas with some eosinophils, similar to lymphadenopathy in multicentric Castleman disease or autoimmune disease.
Reactive follicular hyperplasia: increased IgG4 + plasma cells in germinal centers and often in the interfollicular zones with some eosinophils present.
Interfollicular expansion pattern: expanded interfollicular zones with small lymphocytes, plasmablasts and mature plasma cells and eosinophils which may resemble lymphoma (e.g. angioimmunoblastic lymphoma). Examples are given in Figure 2A–C.
Progressive transformation of germinal center-like: scattered larger or transformed follicles containing plasma cells. An example is given in Figure 2D, E.
Inflammatory pseudotumor-like: lymph node partially effaced by a fibro-inflammatory infiltrate and storiform fibrosis; this subtype is considered most specific for IgG4-RD in lymph nodes. An example is given in Figure 2F.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^114JtQ6Z]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Lymphadenopathy at the crossroad between immunodeficiency and autoinflammation: an intriguing challenge [^114KVjMn]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathies can be part of the clinical spectrum of several primary immunodeficiencies, including diseases with immune dysregulation and autoinflammatory disorders, as the clinical expression of benign polyclonal lymphoproliferation, granulomatous disease or lymphoid malignancy. Lymphadenopathy poses a significant diagnostic dilemma when it represents the first sign of a disorder of the immune system, leading to a consequently delayed diagnosis. Additionally, the finding of lymphadenopathy in a patient with diagnosed immunodeficiency raises the question of the differential diagnosis between benign lymphoproliferation and malignancies. Lymphadenopathies are evidenced in 15–20% of the patients with common variable immunodeficiency, while in other antibody deficiencies the prevalence is lower. They are also evidenced in different combined immunodeficiency disorders, including Omenn syndrome, which presents in the first months of life. Interestingly, in the activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disorders and regulatory T cell disorders, lymphadenopathy is one of the leading signs of the entire clinical picture. Among autoinflammatory diseases, the highest prevalence of lymphadenopathies is observed in patients with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) and hyper-immunoglobulin (Ig)D syndrome. The mechanisms underlying lymphoproliferation in the different disorders of the immune system are multiple and not completely elucidated. The advances in genetic techniques provide the opportunity of identifying new monogenic disorders, allowing genotype-phenotype correlations to be made and to provide adequate follow-up and treatment in the single diseases. In this work, we provide an overview of the most relevant immune disorders associated with lymphadenopathy, focusing on their diagnostic and prognostic implications.

TBNA Validity and Reliability

Adequate samples were obtained for 439 (75.7%) patients. Cytohistologic diagnoses could be made for 343 (59.1%) patients and there was abundant lymphoid cellularity in 96 (16.6%) patients. Samples obtained through TBNA were considered non-adequate for 141 (24.3%) patients. Of the 237 patients for whom a specific diagnosis could not be made based on TBNA (141 with inadequate samples + 96 with only lymphoid cellularity in the samples), diagnoses were ultimately established for 106 (44.7%): 65 patients were diagnosed using surgical techniques and 41 patients were diagnosed during clinical-radiologic follow-up.

Table 3 shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy for TBNA. Sensitivity and accuracy were lower for lymphomas than for other pathologies except anthracotic and reactive adenopathies. The NPV was low for every diagnosis group and there were no significant differences among the groups.

The diagnoses of 63 of the patients whose samples had abundant lymphoid cellularity and could not support a specific diagnosis were ultimately verified. Of them, 42 were considered TPs (all were anthracotic or reactive adenopathies), 14 were TNs, and seven were FNs (sensitivity, 85.7%; NPV, 66.7%; accuracy, 88.9%).

Factors Influencing the Acquisition of Diagnostic Samples

In univariate analysis (Table 4), factors associated with the acquisition of diagnostic samples with p < 0.20 were type of disease, type of needle used, adenopathy diameter, and the existence of indirect signs at the insertion site. In multivariate analysis, only adenopathy diameter and the existence of indirect signs at the insertion site were independent predictors of acquiring a diagnostic sample (Table 4).

### Reactive eosinophil proliferations in tissue and the lymphocytic variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome [^116VAFSE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2019 Society for Hematopathology and European Association for Haematopathology Workshop reviewed the spectrum of neoplastic, nonneoplastic, and borderline entities associated with reactive eosinophilia in tissue.

Methods

The workshop panel reviewed 46 cases covered in 2 workshop sessions.

Results

The 46 cases were presented with their consensus diagnoses during the workshop. Reactive eosinophilia in lymph nodes and other tissues may be accompanied by or be distinct from peripheral blood eosinophilia. Reactive etiologies included inflammatory disorders such as Kimura disease and IgG4-related disease, which may show overlapping pathologic features and reactions to infectious agents and hypersensitivity (covered in a separate review). Hodgkin, T-cell, and B-cell lymphomas and histiocytic neoplasms can result in reactive eosinophilia. The spectrum of these diseases is discussed and illustrated through representative cases.

Conclusions

Reactive eosinophilia in lymph nodes and tissues may be related to both nonneoplastic and neoplastic lymphoid proliferations and histiocytic and nonhematolymphoid processes. Understanding the differential diagnosis of reactive eosinophilia and the potential for overlapping clinical and pathologic findings is critical in reaching the correct diagnosis so that patients can be treated appropriately.

### Epstein-Barr virus burden in adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113GXS96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a presumed primary or reactivated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serologic response had evidence of an active EBV infection.

Background

Patients with SLE often have what appears to be a primary or reactivated EBV serologic response. If these patients then present with fever, fatigue, adenopathy or leukopenia, it is not clear whether these symptoms are caused by worsening SLE or EBV infection. Establishing the correct diagnosis is crucial for management.

Methods

We examined the EBV burden in 13 adolescents with SLE and a presumed primary or reactivated EBV serologic response. All were taking prednisone; 2 each were also on azathioprine or intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide. EBV serologies were performed for all, and EBV burdens were assessed via immortalization assays and EBV DNA amplification of blood and saliva at least once.

Results

Seven patients had serologic patterns indicative of a primary EBV infection, while six had serologies indicative of a reactivated (secondary) EBV infection. Two of the latter were the only ones in whom a small amount of biologically active EBV was detected.

Conclusion

In our series active EBV infection was not seen in most patients, despite serologic data that could be interpreted as a primary or reactivated infection. Thus the serologic profiles were more likely a consequence of immune dysregulation secondary to SLE or its therapy rather than rampant infection with EBV.

### Lymphadenopathy at the crossroad between immunodeficiency and autoinflammation: an intriguing challenge [^117Q81Y4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathies can be part of the clinical spectrum of several primary immunodeficiencies, including diseases with immune dysregulation and autoinflammatory disorders, as the clinical expression of benign polyclonal lymphoproliferation, granulomatous disease or lymphoid malignancy. Lymphadenopathy poses a significant diagnostic dilemma when it represents the first sign of a disorder of the immune system, leading to a consequently delayed diagnosis. Additionally, the finding of lymphadenopathy in a patient with diagnosed immunodeficiency raises the question of the differential diagnosis between benign lymphoproliferation and malignancies. Lymphadenopathies are evidenced in 15–20% of the patients with common variable immunodeficiency, while in other antibody deficiencies the prevalence is lower. They are also evidenced in different combined immunodeficiency disorders, including Omenn syndrome, which presents in the first months of life. Interestingly, in the activated phosphoinositide 3‐kinase delta syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)‐related lymphoproliferative disorders and regulatory T cell disorders, lymphadenopathy is one of the leading signs of the entire clinical picture. Among autoinflammatory diseases, the highest prevalence of lymphadenopathies is observed in patients with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) and hyper‐immunoglobulin (Ig)D syndrome. The mechanisms underlying lymphoproliferation in the different disorders of the immune system are multiple and not completely elucidated. The advances in genetic techniques provide the opportunity of identifying new monogenic disorders, allowing genotype–phenotype correlations to be made and to provide adequate follow‐up and treatment in the single diseases. In this work, we provide an overview of the most relevant immune disorders associated with lymphadenopathy, focusing on their diagnostic and prognostic implications.

### Role of EUS for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy [^113pvKE2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Imaging of mediastinal adenopathy by EUS — capabilities and nodal station access include that radial EUS provides CT-like images but cannot perform FNA, whereas linear EUS produces an "approximately 180-degree" image and allows FNA; EUS can access "Stations 8 and 9" and posterior "station 7", "station 5" if enlarged, "station 4L" but not usually "4R" unless enlarged, and intrapulmonary nodes are inaccessible.

### The clinical importance of axillary lymphadenopathy detected on screening mammography: revisited [^112Bo37K]. Clinical Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to re-evaluate our protocol for the management of isolated axillary lymphadenopathy (ALP) on mammographic screening.

Methods

In a retrospective review of 200,716 women screened at the South West London Breast Screening Service (SWLBSS) over 7 years, 72 women with ALP with an otherwise normal mammogram were identified. Thirteen patients were not recalled, nine of who had a known underlying diagnosis and the remainder had longstanding unchanged mammograms. Fifty-nine patients were recalled for further clinical assessment and investigations, including ultrasound, further mammographic views, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), blood tests and a chest radiograph. Those with a definite diagnosis were referred for appropriate management and those with benign reactive cytology on FNAC reviewed at 6 weeks with subsequent referral for excision of persisting abnormal nodes.

Results

The ultimate diagnosis was benign in 45 cases: 26 benign reactive changes, 11 arthritides, five with dermatological and viral conditions and three with tuberculosis. Malignancy was diagnosed in 13 cases: four with metastatic breast carcinoma and nine with lymphoma/leukaemia. The total number of newly diagnosed malignancies was 20% of women recalled. Another 5% of patients had active tuberculosis. Of the 22 patients with benign reactive cytology, one had significant pathology on excision biopsy: tuberculosis. Over 95% of the results from excision biopsy in these patients did not alter management.

Conclusion

In the majority of patients, the FNAC results were representative of the final excision pathology. The present study suggests that excision biopsy could be omitted for those patients whose FNAC and culture are negative.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115KjozA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Lymphogranuloma Venereum

LGV is caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3. LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive infection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A — K that cause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations of LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. Rectal exposure among MSM or women can result in proctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of LGV infection, and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus. Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been reported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection. LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic infection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic colorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also been reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can also be asymptomatic. A common clinical manifestation of LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited genital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. However, by the time persons seek care, the lesions have often disappeared. LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe, with bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy. Oral ulceration can occur and might be associated with cervical adenopathy. Persons with genital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary bacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and nonsexually transmitted pathogens.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of the thyroid and extracranial head and neck [^114Vdny4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node ultrasound evaluation — Sonographic examination of cervical lymph nodes may be comprehensive or focused, as appropriate for the clinical question and scenario. The size and location of abnormal lymph nodes should be documented, and suspicious nodal morphology including, but not limited to, calcification, cysts/ focal echogenic areas that are unrelated to a fatty hilum, and abnormal blood flow should be documented. Round shape and absence of echogenic hilum, although reported in malignant nodes, are findings with poor specificity in thyroid cancer. Location of abnormal lymph node(s) should be documented with annotations and/or enough visual information to describe the location according to the image-based nodal classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, or in a fashion that allows the referring clinician to convert the location of abnormal nodes to that system. Node evaluation should be performed at centers with experienced personnel, and lymph node size varies with nodal compartment with node size often less important in malignancy assessment than nodal morphology. Enlarged cervical nodes can be seen in lymphoma and other malignancies but are often reactive and are seen in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory disease processes such as postviral syndromes and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In the pediatric population, cervical lymph node size, echotexture, vascularity, and potential nodal suppuration or abscess-formation evaluation are important in the evaluation of acute lymphadenitis.

### Multimodality imaging of indolent B cell lymphoma from diagnosis to transformation: what every radiologist should know [^116oyQff]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Imaging approach to transformation

An imaging algorithm for management of suspected histologic transformation is presented in Fig. 9.

Imaging algorithm for management of suspected histologic transformation

Clinical scenario

Patients with HT could present to the radiologist in two ways: as asymptomatic patients undergoing surveillance for lymphoma or CLL with evidence of HT on imaging, or patients with clinical signs or symptoms suspicious for HT, including systemic signs, such as fatigue, infections or bleeding, "B" symptoms (fever, profuse night sweats, and unexplained weight loss), adenopathy or organomegaly, and increased LDH or hypercalcemia.

Imaging evaluation

Asymptomatic patients are generally imaged with CT or PET/CT. Symptomatic patients can undergo PET/CT if the primary lymphoma is known to be FDG avid; CT if the disease is not FDG avid, to evaluate imaging characteristic of nodal disease or extranodal involvement of disease or in cases of suspected emergent conditions (splenic rupture, bowel obstruction). MRI should be reserved in cases of potential extranodal involvement, such as bone marrow, liver, kidney, central nervous system, or soft tissue involvement. Ultrasound may be useful to study morphology and sonographic characteristics of superficial lymph nodes, as a first line imaging method to study focal extranodal involvement or to guide biopsy (Fig. 2). Once PET/CT has been obtained, images should be checked for presence of discrepancy in FDG avidity within the nodal groups or extranodal sites of disease, evidence of new or increased organomegaly and whenever possible, presence of decreased density of lymph nodes. On CT, US, and MR, presence of discrepant nodal enlargement, organomegaly, or morphologic and signal characteristics of HT, such as decreased lymph node density, heterogeneous echogenicity, or increased T2-hyperintensity for nodal disease, and typical imaging features, mentioned earlier in the paper, for extranodal involvement should raise suspicion for HT.

### FDG-PET / CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^111FKyWj]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Fig. 5
HIV positive patient with SCC of the left piriform sinus. a Axial PETCT illustrates a nodular area of high FDG uptake at left level II (asterisk) and bilateral nodular areas of symmetrical high FDG uptake laterally in the neck (arrows). There is an additional nodular area of high FDG uptake in the right retropharyngeal region (arrowhead). All nodular areas of high FDG uptake appear to represent metastatic adenopathy. b Corresponding axial CECT image shows an enlarged enhancing left level II node (asterisk). No suspicious adenopathy is seen at the other sites of increased FDG uptake including the lateral sides of the neck as well as the right retropharyngeal region. c Corresponding coronal PET/CT image confirms the linear nature of the foci of high FDG uptake in both sternocleidomastoid muscles (arrow) and in the right longus colli muscle (arrowheads). Areas of avid nodular FDG uptake are seen at left level II and III (asterisks). d Corresponding coronal CECT image confirms that the linear areas of FDG uptake correspond to neck muscles. Metastatic cervical adenopathy is confirmed at left level II and III (asterisks). The high uptake in the right longus colli and bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles was related to involuntary contraction in this very anxious patient

Increased FDG uptake potentially causing false-positive findings

Inflammation and infection

As mentioned above, benign conditions like inflammation, infection and granulomatous diseases may show increased FDG uptake in head and neck cancer patients, thereby mimicking malignancy. The uptake in these cases is attributed to increased glycolysis in activated inflammatory cells (mainly macrophages). Increased FDG uptake is typically seen at sites of infection, indwelling ports and catheters, foreign body granulomas, reactive nodes, vasculitis and in active atherosclerotic plaques (Fig. 7). Recent studies have shown that FDG uptake not only allows reliable identification of vulnerable plaques in the carotid arteries but also reflects the severity of atherosclerotic vessel wall inflammation. Therefore, precise image fusion between PET and CT data sets, as well as correlation with CECT, is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis of carotid plaque uptake as metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. 7). This pitfall is typically encountered when only unenhanced CT scans are available for image interpretation and whenever patient motion between the CT and the PET acquisition leads to mis-coregistration of images (see below).

### IgG4-related lung disease as a differential diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disease: atypical presentation of an atypical disease [^115AJZWM]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The presence of multiple adenopathies is frequent in IgG4-RD, being the first manifestation in some cases.

When lymphadenopathy is generalised, the differential diagnosis becomes more complex. In our patient, the initial diagnosis considered lymphoma, but other diseases such as Castleman disease and disseminated malignancy were also considered as differentials.

Our case fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD, with an extensive involvement outside the lung, therefore, the diagnosis was made.

Learning points

Diagnosing IgG4-related lung disease (RLD) can be a challenge, since initial imaging changes tend to be nonspecific, leading to confounding interpretations, such as malignancy, infectious process or other pulmonary disorders
The patient's clinical history, culture results (if available), pathology and laboratory results (high serum levels of IgG4) can be helpful diagnostic tools
The spectrum of differential diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (RD) is wide, and it includes, among others, malignant primary or lymphoproliferative processes. Considering this, surgical biopsy is essential for a conclusive diagnosis
Glucocorticoids are the first line treatment for patients with IgG4-RD, and a positive response supports the potential diagnosis of IgG4-RLD. However, biopsy gives the definite diagnosis.
