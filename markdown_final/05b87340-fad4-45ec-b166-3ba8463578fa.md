## Question

High troponin 1000, in 2 hours no chest pain no EKG CHANGES IN SEPSIS PATIENT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a very high troponin of 1000 ng/L in a septic patient without chest pain or ECG changes, and whether this represents type 2 myocardial infarction or non-ischemic myocardial injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome in sepsis. Then, I should verify the troponin assay and whether the value truly exceeds the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Next, I will review the universal definition to distinguish myocardial injury from myocardial infarction, and specifically whether this fits type 2 MI. After that, I need to check for alternative explanations for troponin elevation in sepsis, including renal dysfunction and catecholamine surge. Finally, I will outline immediate management, the role of serial troponins and echocardiography, and when, if ever, to pursue coronary angiography, anchoring decisions to contemporary guidelines and sepsis literature.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. In sepsis, troponin elevation is common and often reflects non-thrombotic myocardial injury rather than plaque rupture, so the absence of chest pain and ischemic ECG changes substantially lowers the likelihood of type 1 MI and shifts the differential toward type 2 MI or non-ischemic myocardial injury, especially given supply–demand mismatch, microvascular dysfunction, and direct inflammatory toxicity in sepsis [^114o1awW] [^112vc2ao].

> Wait, let me verify the troponin value and assay context. A troponin of 1000 ng/L is extremely high and, if using conventional units where the 99th percentile URL is typically around 14–50 ng/L depending on the assay, this represents a roughly 20–70 fold elevation above the URL, which would meet the biomarker criterion for myocardial injury. However, I should confirm the exact assay, its URL, and whether the reported unit is ng/L versus ng/mL to avoid a unit error, because some laboratories report in ng/mL where 1.0 ng/mL equals 1000 ng/L and would be far less dramatic than it appears at first glance [^113JETdr] [^115B1QtG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MI yet. I need to apply the Universal Definition framework: myocardial injury is present when troponin is above the 99th percentile with a dynamic rise and/or fall, but myocardial infarction requires evidence of ischemia by symptoms, ECG, imaging, or angiography. Without ischemic symptoms or ECG changes, this pattern supports myocardial injury but not MI, and if there is a convincing ischemic mechanism from supply–demand mismatch in sepsis, it may be labeled type 2 MI only when corroborating ischemic evidence is present [^114o1awW] [^113Sh2Tc] [^112taSra].

> I will now examine alternative explanations for such a marked troponin rise in sepsis. Mechanisms include cytokine-mediated myocyte injury, microvascular dysfunction, catecholamine surge with subendocardial ischemia, and impaired renal clearance. Importantly, studies show troponin elevation in sepsis correlates with severity of illness and renal dysfunction, and may not reflect large-vessel coronary disease, so I should check renal function and consider that a very high value could still be non-ischemic in this context [^112vc2ao] [^112LxJKN].

> Next, I should review immediate management priorities. The focus must remain on sepsis care: early antibiotics, source control, hemodynamic optimization with fluids and vasopressors to a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, and close monitoring. I should avoid reflexively initiating antiplatelet therapy or heparin in the absence of ACS features, because troponin elevation alone is not an indication for antithrombotics in non-thrombotic injury, and inappropriate anticoagulation can cause harm in septic patients [^112W1ABT].

> Let me consider serial troponin dynamics and cardiac imaging. I should double-check a second hs-cTn in 1–3 hours to assess for a significant rise or fall, recognizing that in sepsis the kinetics may be blunted and that small deltas can be misleading; concurrently, transthoracic echocardiography can help distinguish septic cardiomyopathy, regional wall motion abnormalities suggesting ischemia, or pericardial effusion, and can guide hemodynamic management without exposing the patient to invasive testing prematurely [^113Sh2Tc] [^111L8TPT] [^114o1awW].

> But wait, what if the troponin continues to rise and new ischemic ECG changes appear. In that scenario, I should reconsider the diagnosis toward type 1 or type 2 MI and escalate evaluation with cardiology consultation; coronary angiography is generally reserved for patients with persistent ischemia, hemodynamic compromise, malignant arrhythmias, or a convincing ACS phenotype, and observational ICU data suggest that many "MIs" detected by troponin plus ECG in septic patients are missed clinically yet carry high mortality, underscoring the need for careful, context-aware interpretation rather than automatic catheterization [^1128awwu] [^114o1awW] [^11613zoQ].

> I should confirm the prognostic implications and follow-up. Elevated troponin in sepsis is associated with worse outcomes, but after adjustment for confounders such as severity of illness and renal function, it may not independently predict mortality, so I should treat it as a marker of severity and ensure longitudinal cardiovascular risk assessment after recovery; if the patient survives, outpatient evaluation for underlying coronary disease is reasonable once the acute illness abates [^113UBjQp] [^115BP7zh].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not overcall MI here. With a troponin of 1000 ng/L, no chest pain, and a non-ischemic ECG in sepsis, the most accurate initial diagnosis is acute myocardial injury due to sepsis rather than type 1 MI. Type 2 MI remains possible only if ischemic features emerge, and management should prioritize sepsis care, serial troponins, echocardiography, and selective cardiology input rather than routine antithrombotics or invasive angiography in the absence of ACS features [^114o1awW] [^113Sh2Tc] [^112W1ABT].

---

In sepsis, a troponin of 1000 ng/L with no chest pain or ECG changes most often reflects **non-ischemic myocardial injury** from cytokine-mediated inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and supply–demand mismatch [^112vc2ao] [^116JQX4P], rather than acute coronary syndrome [^111L8TPT]. This degree of elevation is common in sepsis and correlates with severity and mortality, but **does not mandate ACS treatment** in the absence of ischemic features [^113UBjQp] [^112W1ABT]. Management should focus on **sepsis care**, with serial troponins and echocardiography to assess for evolving cardiac dysfunction; cardiology consult is reasonable, but invasive coronary evaluation is not indicated without ischemic symptoms or ECG changes [^114o1awW].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of troponin elevation in sepsis

Several **non-ischemic mechanisms** can explain troponin release in sepsis:

- **Cytokine-mediated injury**: TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β cause myocyte apoptosis and necrosis [^notfound].

- **Microvascular dysfunction**: Endothelial injury and microthrombi cause ischemia without epicardial coronary obstruction [^117SjFtp].

- **Supply–demand mismatch**: Hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia increase myocardial oxygen demand while reducing supply [^111L8TPT].

- **Direct toxin-mediated injury**: Bacterial endotoxins and catecholamine surge can injure myocytes directly [^111L8TPT].

---

## Clinical significance of troponin elevation in sepsis

Troponin elevation in sepsis is common and associated with **severity and mortality** [^113UBjQp]. Prevalence ranges from 12% to 85% depending on assay sensitivity and population [^117SjFtp] [^111j3Anu]. Elevated troponin independently predicts higher short- and long-term mortality, even after adjusting for confounders [^113bMkoq] [^1177rNsb]. It also correlates with septic cardiomyopathy and myocardial dysfunction, which are linked to worse outcomes [^111j3Anu].

---

## Diagnostic approach to troponin elevation in sepsis

In sepsis, **troponin elevation alone does not establish ACS**; a structured approach is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tool** | **Findings suggestive of acs** | **Findings suggestive of non-ischemic injury** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical symptoms | Chest pain, dyspnea, syncope | No chest pain, sepsis symptoms |
| 2 | ECG | ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave inversion, new Q waves | No ischemic changes |
| 3 | Serial troponin measurements | Rise and/or fall pattern ≥ 20% | Stable or minimal change |
| 4 | Echocardiography | Regional wall motion abnormalities | Global dysfunction, no regional abnormalities |
| 5 | Coronary angiography | Coronary occlusion | Normal or non-obstructive coronaries |

---

In this case, the absence of chest pain and ECG changes, along with a very high troponin, strongly favors **non-ischemic myocardial injury** from sepsis rather than ACS [^114o1awW].

---

## Management implications

Management should **prioritize sepsis care** — antibiotics, hemodynamic support, and source control — while monitoring for evolving cardiac dysfunction. Serial troponins and echocardiography help detect new regional wall motion abnormalities or rising troponin trends that would prompt reconsideration of ACS. Cardiology consultation is reasonable, but invasive coronary angiography is not indicated without ischemic symptoms or ECG changes [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Troponin elevation in sepsis is a marker of severity and higher mortality risk, though it is not an independent predictor after adjustment for illness severity and organ dysfunction [^113UBjQp]. Persistent or rising troponin may signal ongoing myocardial injury and worse outcomes, warranting closer monitoring and aggressive supportive care [^11189R3p].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A troponin of 1000 ng/L in sepsis without chest pain or ECG changes most likely reflects **non-ischemic myocardial injury** from sepsis-related inflammation and supply–demand mismatch. Management should focus on sepsis care, serial troponins, and echocardiography; invasive coronary evaluation is not indicated without ischemic features. This approach avoids unnecessary interventions while addressing the underlying septic process and its cardiac effects.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

High-STEACS early rule-out clinical decision pathway for chest pain with nonischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) specifies that symptom onset ≥ 3 hours and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) < 5 ng/L or high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) < 6 ng/L leads to rule out low risk with discharge home and outpatient follow-up, while baseline hs-cTnI 5 ng/L–99th percentile or hs-cTnT 6 ng/L–99th percentile prompts retesting at 3 hours to assess 0–3-hour Δ < 3 ng/L versus 0–3-hour Δ ≥ 3 ng/L (the latter indicating additional evaluation and testing); hs-cTnI or hs-cTnT > 99th percentile is labeled abnormal higher risk and also indicates additional evaluation and testing, and although trials used ≥ 2 hours from symptom onset, the pathway recommends requiring a ≥ 3-hour period between chest pain onset and the first troponin measurement to qualify for rule out at time 0, with additional evaluation including consideration of hospital observation or admission and noninvasive anatomic or functional testing.

Myocardial infarction definition — operationalizing high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) testing for diagnosis and rule-out: To establish the diagnosis of an acute MI, a rise and/or fall in cTn values with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile URL is required, coupled with a high clinical and/or ECG likelihood of myocardial ischemia. hs-cTn assays shorten time to diagnosis in many patients to within 3 hours of symptom onset, but some patients rule-in late at 6 hours and late presenters (> 12–18 hours) on the downslope may require longer sampling; with hs-cTn, the magnitude of these changes has been reported in the range of 18% to 30%. For rule-out, strategies using very low hs-cTn on presentation or no change with persistently normal values over a 1–2 hour period have been advocated; a single sample rule-out using a very low value (in many cases the LoD of the assay) has high sensitivity and high negative predictive value, but this strategy should not be used in those who present early (< 2 hours after the onset of chest discomfort). For sampling, blood samples should be drawn on first assessment (designated as 0 hour) and repeated 3 to 6 hours later, or earlier with hs-cTn assays, and sampling beyond 6 hours may be required in certain patients.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^116xMWsK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Troponin‐T elevation is seen commonly in sepsis and septic shock patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We sought to evaluate the role of admission and serial troponin‐T testing in the prognostication of these patients.

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective cohort study from 2007 to 2014 on patients admitted to the intensive care units at the Mayo Clinic with severe sepsis and septic shock. Elevated admission troponin‐T and significant delta troponin‐T were defined as ≥ 0.01 ng/mL and ≥ 0.03 ng/mL in 3 hours, respectively. The primary outcome was in‐hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1‐year mortality and lengths of stay. During this 8‐year period, 944 patients met the inclusion criteria with 845 (90%) having an admission troponin‐T ≥ 0.01 ng/mL. Serial troponin‐T values were available in 732 (78%) patients. Elevated admission troponin‐T was associated with older age, higher baseline comorbidity, and severity of illness, whereas significant delta troponin‐T was associated with higher severity of illness. Admission log 10 troponin‐T was associated with unadjusted in‐hospital (odds ratio 1.6; P = 0.003) and 1‐year mortality (odds ratio 1.3; P = 0.04), but did not correlate with length of stay. Elevated delta troponin‐T and log 10 delta troponin‐T were not significantly associated with any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Admission log 10 troponin‐T remained an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.4; P = 0.04) and 1‐year survival (hazard ratio 1.3; P = 0.008).

Conclusions

In patients with sepsis and septic shock, elevated admission troponin‐T was associated with higher short‐ and long‐term mortality. Routine serial troponin‐T testing did not add incremental prognostic value in these patients.

### Simplified predictive instrument to rule out acute coronary syndromes in a high-risk population [^113QxYPU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether diagnostic protocols based on cardiac markers to identify low‐risk chest pain patients suitable for early release from the emergency department can be applied to patients older than 65 years or with traditional cardiac risk factors.

Methods and Results

In a single‐center retrospective study of 231 consecutive patients with high‐risk factor burden in which a first cardiac troponin (n) level was measured in the emergency department and a secondn sample was drawn 4 to 14 hours later, we compared the performance of a modified 2‐Hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Assess Patients with Chest Pain Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarker (ADAPT) rule to a new risk classification scheme that identifies patients as low risk if they have no known coronary artery disease, a nonischemic electrocardiogram, and 2n levels below the assay's limit of detection. Demographic and outcome data were abstracted through chart review. The median age of our population was 64 years, and 75% had Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction risk score ≥ 2. Using our risk classification rule, 53 (23%) patients were low risk with a negative predictive value for 30‐day cardiac events of 98%. Applying a modifiedrule to our cohort, 18 (8%) patients were identified as low risk with a negative predictive value of 100%. In a sensitivity analysis, the negative predictive value of our risk algorithm did not change when we relied only on undetectable baselinen and eliminated the secondn assessment.

Conclusions

If confirmed in prospective studies, this less‐restrictive risk classification strategy could be used to safely identify chest pain patients with more traditional cardiac risk factors for early emergency department release.

### A prospective study of the impact of serial troponin measurements on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and hospital and six-month mortality in patients admitted to ICU with non-cardiac diagnoses [^111R33F6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Association with sepsis and vasopressor use

On the first day in ICU, 105 patients (73%) satisfied ≥ 2 criteria for SIRS. During their stay in ICU, 104 (72%) patients were septic. The diagnosis of sepsis was associated with increased ICU mortality (28% versus 8%) and increased hospital mortality (35% versus 15%).

Treatment with one or more inotropic or vasoactive drug was necessary in 86 patients of whom 98% received norepinephrine and 6 patients were on two or more medications. Use of vasoactive drugs was associated with both ICU and hospital mortality (37% versus 2%, and 44% versus 7%, respectively).

On the day of troponin rise, 100 patients (69%) had sepsis. Their ICU mortality was 28% compared to 9% in patients who were not septic when they had an elevated troponin level. On the day of troponin elevation, 84 patients (58%) were receiving vasopressors. Their ICU mortality was 37% compared to 2% in patients who were not on vasopressors.

Among patients with a possible or definite MI, 68% of patients were septic and 63% were on vasopressors on the day when the criteria for MI were fulfilled, with similar proportions in those with a definite and possible MI. Only 30% of patients who never had a troponin rise received vasopressor treatment at some stage during their stay in ICU.

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^114TxmAE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions: The Jury Is Still Out

The study by Choi et al challenges the assumption that troponin elevation in sepsis predicts poor outcomes. While elevated troponin may indicate systemic dysfunction, its role as an independent mortality predictor remains unclear. The question persists: Is troponin a sentinel of sepsis‐induced myocardial injury or merely a bystander in multiorgan dysfunction?

Until further clarity emerges, clinicians should be judicious in ordering and interpreting troponin levels, ensuring that their measurement leads to actionable decisions rather than misguided concern. The contrasting findings of various studies highlight the complexity of troponin as a biomarker and the need for better‐defined clinical applications. In the chaos of sepsis, it is imperative to separate the signal of clinically significant myocardial injury, which portends increased death, from the noise of low‐grade myocardial inflammation and troponin leak. Yet a paradigm other than physician heuristics is not currently available. In the ever‐evolving battle against sepsis, perhaps it is time to rethink our biomarkers, assumptions, and clinical approach to troponin in noncardiac disease where the heart is not the star of the show. Much ado about elevation? The jury is still out.

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^11189R3p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications: Should Practice Change?

Despite the lack of clear guidelines, troponin is widely measured in patients with sepsis, with reports suggesting that > 60% undergo testing. In the study by Choi et al, 80% of patients had troponin measured at sepsis recognition, despite unclear clinical benefit. While these findings raise questions about the value of routine measurement, they also highlight the importance of considering the dynamic nature of troponin levels in sepsis. A single measurement at sepsis onset may not capture the full prognostic picture, as troponin elevation can fluctuate over time.

Findings from Jendoubi et al further support this cautious approach, showing that although 47% of patients with septic shock had elevated troponin levels, only persistent elevation at 72 hours was independently associated with the 28‐day mortality rate. Choi et al may have demonstrated that a single elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis diagnosis is not clinically meaningful. Thus, rather than promoting routine or frequent testing, these findings suggest that when troponin is measured, attention to timing and trends may be more informative than a single early measurement.

Cardiac troponin sampling and rapid rule-out considerations in acute chest pain: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays may be used to guide disposition by repeat sampling at 1, 2, or 3 hours from emergency department (ED) arrival, whereas when using conventional cTn assays the sampling timeframe is extended to 3 to 6 hours from ED arrival. CDPs that emphasize rapid rule-out based on single hs-cTn concentrations below the limit of detection should be limited to patients whose symptoms started at least 3 hours before ED arrival, and unlike high-sensitivity assays, clinical decision-making based on single measurement of conventional cTn has not been validated. If clinical suspicion persists after serial cTn measurement, it may be reasonable to repeat cTn assay later (ie, beyond 3 hours for high-sensitivity and beyond 6 hours for conventional assays), and CDPs that include risk scores all perform well overall, with 99% to 100% sensitivity for index-visit AMI and 30-day MACE.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^1177rNsb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with sepsis and septic shock, elevations in TnT are common and are associated with increased prevalence of coronary artery disease and higher severity of illness. After correcting for these factors, elevations in TnT were independently associated with increased risk of short‐ and long‐term mortality. Among patients with elevated TnT, one fifth displayed a significant delta TnT on serial testing. Patients with an elevated delta TnT were not at increased risk of adverse outcomes, calling into question the value of serial TnT testing in this population. Further research is warranted to better understand the cause, pathogenesis, clinical implications, and need for serial testing of TnT levels in patients with sepsis and septic shock.

### Impact of elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis recognition on the clinical outcomes: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^113pGpYe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this nationwide prospective observational study, the relationship between troponin elevation at the time of sepsis recognition and clinical outcomes was examined using propensity score matching among patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU. The principal findings are as follows: (1) in the cohort of eligible patients, elevated troponin levels at sepsis recognition were confirmed in 32.5% of cases, although these findings were not associated with organ support, ICU events, or clinical outcomes; (2) the group with elevated troponin levels demonstrated a lower survival probability after 1 week; and (3) when analyzing correlations with organ failure up to Day 7, only renal dysfunction was associated with elevated troponin levels at the time of sepsis recognition.

In this study, 32.5% of the cohort demonstrated elevated troponin levels upon sepsis recognition. This high prevalence aligns with prior findings, underscoring the necessity of understanding the clinical implications of troponin elevation in patients with sepsis. The frequent occurrence of elevated troponin has sparked interest in its potential as a biomarker for risk stratification and prognostication in this population. However, it has not been determined whether troponin can fulfill this role. Previous studies have identified a significant link between troponin elevation and mortality in sepsis patients. In contrast, recent research by Garcia et al. revealed no significant associations between peak troponin levels during sepsis and 1‐year mortality rates after adjusting for confounders. Our findings indicate that troponin elevation at sepsis recognition was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in a matched cohort of patients with sepsis without prior cardiovascular disease. One potential explanation for these findings is that the troponin levels measured were not peak values, potentially failing to encompass all instances of cardiac injury. Additionally, the exclusion of patients with prior cardiovascular disease may have influenced these results. Moreover, the use of propensity score matching in our study effectively minimized selection bias and confounding, thus ensuring a balanced comparison of key characteristics between the groups.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Patients With and Without Measured Troponin‐T

Table 2
Baseline Characteristics of Patients With Elevated Admission Troponin‐T and Elevated Delta Troponin‐T

Serial TnT testing at 3 hours and 6 hours was performed in 732 (77.5%) patients with a measured admission TnT level. An elevated delta TnT ≥ 0.03 ng/mL was present in 196 (26.8%) patients: 185 (27.4%) patients with an elevated admission TnT and 11 (19.6%) without an elevated admission TnT (P = 0.27). Detailed baseline characteristics of patients with and without significant delta TnT are listed in Table 2. Elevated delta TnT was associated with higher severity of illness as evidenced by higher rates of septic shock, peak lactate levels, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III and day 1 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. N‐terminal‐pro B‐type natriuretic peptide levels were recorded in 191 (25.7%) patients. There were no differences in N‐terminal‐pro B‐type natriuretic peptide levels in patients with and without elevated TnT (4283 [1633–11 542] versus 3356 [963–6205] pg/mL; P = 0.25) and significant delta TnT (4435 [1561–9523] versus 4128 [1657–12 053] pg/mL; P = 0.79).

Clinical Outcomes

In‐hospital and 1‐year mortality rates in the overall cohort were 25.9% and 56.3%, respectively. Median follow‐up was 135 (interquartile range 11–903) days, with 53 (5.6%) patients lost to follow‐up. Unadjusted 1‐year survival using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was lower in patients with elevated admission TnT (P = 0.03 by log‐rank test; Figure 1 A). There was a stepwise increase in in‐hospital mortality (P = 0.007) with increasing quartiles of admission TnT (Figure 2), but this was not seen for 1‐year mortality (P = 0.20). Patients with an elevated admission TnT did not have a higher rate of in‐hospital mortality than patients without elevated admission TnT (26.3% versus 22.2%; P = 0.47). Among hospital survivors, admission and delta TnT were not independent predictors of 1‐year survival (Figure 3 A and 3 B).

Introduction

Sepsis is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in a similar number of fatalities as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) each year. 1, 2 Cardiovascular dysfunction occurs in nearly 70% of septic patients and can manifest as hemodynamic instability, cardiac biomarker elevation, myocardial dysfunction on echocardiography, and end‐organ hypoperfusion. 3 Cardiovascular dysfunction in sepsis is associated with worse hospital and long‐term outcomes, necessitating early diagnosis and management. 1

Cardiac troponin‐T (TnT) and troponin‐I (TnI) are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury and have prognostic implications in many primary noncardiac illnesses including pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke. 4, 5 Increased sensitivity of the contemporary TnT assay has resulted in more frequent clinical detection of myocardial injury from noncoronary causes, including critical illness. 5, 6 Elevations in TnT levels are present in up to 60% of all intensive care unit (ICU) patients and identify patients with increased risk of short‐term and long‐term mortality. 6, 7

Up to 85% of patients with sepsis and septic shock have detectable cardiac TnT levels using standard troponin assays, and troponin levels have demonstrated a variable association with mortality. 2, 8 Cardiac TnT levels correlate with the presence of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. 8, 9, 10 TnT levels in patients with sepsis correlate with duration of hypotension and extent of vasopressor support. 11, 12, 13 Prior studies evaluating the role of troponins in sepsis and septic shock were limited by the use of different troponin assays, small sample sizes, variations in definitions of elevated troponin levels, and loss of patients to follow‐up. 2 These studies display marked heterogeneity because of lack of uniform adaptation of the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit as the standardized cutoffs. 14 Thus, the epidemiology and prognostic value of troponin levels in patients with sepsis depend not only on the assay used but also on the cutoff values used.

This study sought to evaluate the prognostic value of TnT in patients with sepsis and septic shock. We hypothesized that in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, elevated admission TnT would correlate with short‐ and long‐term mortality and length of stay. Furthermore, we hypothesized that an increase in TnT on serial measurement would be of incremental value in risk stratification of these patients.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our nationwide prospective observational study found that troponin elevation at sepsis recognition was highly prevalent but not associated with increased hospital mortality, ICU mortality, or length of stay in a propensity score‐matched cohort of sepsis patients without prior cardiovascular disease. Future research should focus on developing evidence‐based guidelines for the optimal use of troponin testing in patients with sepsis.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^115mYgm6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity troponin validation and conventional-troponin comparisons show divergent performance in serial testing cohorts. A 4-year prospective observational study in 15 US emergency departments demonstrated a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.4% for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T below 6 ng/L and an NPV of 99.3% for a level less than 19 ng/L at 0 and 3 hours. In a prospective cohort substudy using repeated conventional troponin testing, only 1 MACE was identified among 215 low-risk patients with sensitivity 98.9% (95% CI 93.4% to 99.9%), and a subsequent formal validation did not identify any MACE among 177 patients (21%) deemed low risk. Additional Class III studies using high-sensitivity troponin reported very high sensitivity (> 98%) in certain low-risk cohorts. By contrast, secondary analyses using conventional troponin with a 2-hour accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP) reported sensitivity 88.2% (95% CI 63.6% to 98.5%) and 83.9% (95% CI 66.3% to 94.5%) when obtained at presentation and 2 hours. Extending conventional troponin testing to 3 to 4 hours among non-high-risk patients with a negative result yielded only 1 MACE (0.26%) at 30 days.

### Myocardial injury in patients with sepsis and its association with long-term outcome [^112kqzbT]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is frequently complicated by the release of cardiac troponin, but the clinical significance of this myocardial injury remains unclear. We studied the associations between troponin release during sepsis and 1-year outcomes.

Methods and Results

We enrolled consecutive patients with sepsis in 2 Dutch intensive care units between 2011 and 2013. Subjects with a clinically apparent cause of troponin release were excluded. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) concentration in plasma was measured daily during the first 4 intensive care unit days, and multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to model its association with 1-year mortality while adjusting for confounding. In addition, we studied cardiovascular morbidity occurring during the first year after hospital discharge. Among 1258 patients presenting with sepsis, 1124 (89%) were eligible for study inclusion. Hs-cTnI concentrations were elevated in 673 (60%) subjects on day 1, and 755 (67%) ever had elevated levels in the first 4 days. Cox regression analysis revealed that high hs-cTnI concentrations were associated with increased death rates during the first 14 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.59 and hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–2.62 for hs-cTnI concentrations of 100–500 and > 500 ng/L, respectively) but not thereafter. Furthermore, elevated hs-cTnI levels were associated with the development of cardiovascular disease among 200 hospital survivors who were analyzed for this end point (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.50).

Conclusions

Myocardial injury occurs in the majority of patients with sepsis and is independently associated with early-but not late-mortality, as well as postdischarge cardiovascular morbidity.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^114o1awW]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury and/or infarction in critically ill patients — Elevations of cardiac troponin (cTn) values are common in intensive care unit patients and are associated with adverse prognosis regardless of the underlying disease state. Some elevations may reflect type 2 MI due to underlying CAD and increased myocardial oxygen demand, whereas in other patients type 1 MI may occur because of plaque disruption leading to thrombosis in a coronary artery. Other patients may have elevated cTn values with marked decreases in ejection fraction (EF) due to sepsis caused by endotoxin, with myocardial function recovering completely with normal EF once the sepsis is treated. It is frequently challenging for the clinician caring for a critically ill patient with a severe single organ or multiorgan pathological condition to decide on a plan of action when the patient has elevated cTn values, and if and when the patient recovers from the critical illness, clinical judgment should be employed to decide whether, and to what extent, further evaluation for CAD or structural heart disease is indicated.

High-STEACS 0/3-hour algorithm — rule-out criteria and implementation outcomes are as follows: Myocardial infarction (MI) is ruled out if the initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) is < 5 ng/L; if hs-cTnI is ≥ 5 ng/L or the patient is an early presenter, a second hs-cTnI is obtained 3 hours after presentation and MI is ruled out if the change is < 3 ng/L with values remaining below the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). Although early presenters may be defined as presenting within 2 hours of chest pain onset, we recommend using the more conservative 3-hour criterion for the time from chest pain onset. In a stepped-wedge randomized implementation across 7 hospitals in Scotland (N = 31,492), length of stay decreased from 10.1 ± 4.1 to 6.8 ± 3.9 hours (P < 0.001) and emergency department discharge increased from 50% to 71% with similar 30-day safety outcomes; U.S. observational data showed 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value (NPV) for 30-day death or MI when combined with a normal ECG, and performance also extended to the Roche fifth-generation hs-cTnT assay using the LoQ cutoff of 6 ng/L.

### Impact of elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis recognition on the clinical outcomes: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^1149TqhX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions and Outcome Measures

Cardiac troponin levels were measured at each participating institution using either troponin I or troponin T assays. Due to the heterogeneity in assay types (I versus T) and institutional differences in established normal ranges, we standardized troponin results as either normal or elevated based on each institution's own reference ranges rather than analyzing absolute values. Due to variation in the assays used to measure troponin and the methodologies employed across different institutions, it was imperative to establish the normal range values specific to each facility. Based on these institution‐specific reference ranges, we categorized the eligible patients into 2 groups: patients with elevated troponin levels and the control group, the latter of which comprised individuals with troponin levels within the normal range. We defined the elevated troponin group as patients whose cardiac troponin levels at sepsis recognition exceeded the 99th percentile upper reference limit according to each center.,

The primary outcome was hospital mortality, comparing patients with elevated and normal troponin levels. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, ICU mortality, and ICU length of stay. We examined the clinical management of patients during their ICU stays, including the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, high‐flow oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and vasopressors from ICU admission to ICU Day 3. We also collected data regarding clinical events that occurred during ICU stays, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To assess changes in organ dysfunction during the first week after admission to the ICU, we used the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, both total and for each component, from ICU admission to day 7. Septic shock was defined as persistent arterial hypotension requiring a vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg and a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L despite adequate volume resuscitation.

### A comparative 30-day outcome analysis of inpatient evaluation vs outpatient testing in patients presenting with chest pain in the high-sensitivity troponin era. A propensity score matched case-control retrospective study [^113LsedR]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of chest pain presenting to any of Geisinger health system 12 acute care hospital emergency rooms in the period from January 2017 to September 2019. The study aims to compare the 30‐day incidence of ACEs in MI rule‐out patients undergoing inpatient vs outpatient evaluation. Patients were considered for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria: older than age 18, had at least two sets of high‐sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) with the highest measurement being 50 ng/L or less, have ruled out for MI based on a flat troponin trend (absolute rise < 5 ng/L), 10 and had at least 30 days of follow‐up as defined by having an encounter with a Geisinger healthcare provider any time after 29 days of the index ER visit. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, acute heart failure, or sepsis were excluded.

After obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval, the electronic medical record (EMR) was queried to identify our study subjects as well as extract data regarding patients demographics, comorbidities, prior coronary revascularization, results of emergency room laboratory tests, ischemia evaluation within 30 days of the index ER visit including stress testing, coronary computed tomography angiography, and invasive coronary angiography. The electronic record was also searched for the occurrence of coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days and within 1‐year following the ER encounter. Chest pain characteristics and electrocardiography (EKG) results were obtained via manual chart review. Chest pain quality was decided based on treating clinicians' interpretation and, if not available, applying Diamond‐Forrester criteria. 12 EKG results were categorized into normal findings, abnormal findings, and ischemic based on HEART score criteria. 3

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^111GHSkQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent low-risk chest pain — single troponin testing: In adult patients with recurrent, low-risk chest pain, insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against a single conventional troponin measurement, while high-sensitivity assays are characterized by cTn measurement within the normal range in at least 50% of healthy individuals with high precision, defined as a coefficient of variance (CV) ≤ 10% at the 99th percentile. Among nine studies with indirect evidence, 72 out of 15,715 patients (0.5%) with low-risk chest pain had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30 days, and the pooled incidence after a single, normal high sensitivity troponin was 3.4 per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–4.8 per 1000). The main proposed benefit of a single troponin is shorter emergency department (ED) length of stay, with additional potential benefits that patients are spared venipuncture and phlebotomy and hospitals may have lower health-care costs, though these benefits were not addressed by the included studies; the principal harms are missed AMI and MACE that might have been identified with serial testing. Professional guidance differs, with the American Heart Association (AHA) recommending serial troponins and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) providing an option for a single troponin to exclude AMI.

### Early high-sensitivity troponin elevation and short-term mortality in sepsis: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113UBjQp]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation is a well-established phenomenon in sepsis. However, the clinical significance of this phenomenon with high-sensitivity (hs) assays and the current sepsis definition needs to be settled.

Research Question

What is the association between early serum cTn levels measured by hs-assays and the risk of short-term mortality in septic patients?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic review using a comprehensive PubMed, Scopus, and Embase search. Studies were eligible if they reported association data on early hs-cTn and mortality in an adult sample with sepsis that met the Sepsis-3 definition. For the synthesis of the effect of hs-cTn on mortality, we applied random effect models on the pooled unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR and aOR, respectively) of elevated vs. normal hs-cTn serum values, and on the crude standardized mean difference (SMD) of hs-cTn between survivors and non-survivors.

Results

In total, 6242 patients from 17 studies were included, with short-term mortality rates ranging from 16.9% to 53.8%. Using a crude analysis, non-survivor patients showed higher hs-cTn than survivors (SMD of 0.87, 95%CI: 0.41–1.33). Elevated hs-cTn was associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.41–2.25). However, this prognostic effect was absent in studies that adjusted for different confounders (aOR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.99–1.14).

Discussion and Conclusions

Non-survivors of sepsis exhibited significantly elevated hs-cTn levels. While elevated hs-cTn levels are associated with an increased risk of mortality, they are not independently associated with this outcome in sepsis.

### Simplified predictive instrument to rule out acute coronary syndromes in a high-risk population [^111Yyepq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether diagnostic protocols based on cardiac markers to identify low-risk chest pain patients suitable for early release from the emergency department can be applied to patients older than 65 years or with traditional cardiac risk factors.

Methods and Results

In a single-center retrospective study of 231 consecutive patients with high-risk factor burden in which a first cardiac troponin (cTn) level was measured in the emergency department and a second cTn sample was drawn 4 to 14 hours later, we compared the performance of a modified 2-Hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Assess Patients with Chest Pain Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarker (ADAPT) rule to a new risk classification scheme that identifies patients as low risk if they have no known coronary artery disease, a nonischemic electrocardiogram, and 2 cTn levels below the assay's limit of detection. Demographic and outcome data were abstracted through chart review. The median age of our population was 64 years, and 75% had Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction risk score ≥ 2. Using our risk classification rule, 53 (23%) patients were low risk with a negative predictive value for 30-day cardiac events of 98%. Applying a modified ADAPT rule to our cohort, 18 (8%) patients were identified as low risk with a negative predictive value of 100%. In a sensitivity analysis, the negative predictive value of our risk algorithm did not change when we relied only on undetectable baseline cTn and eliminated the second cTn assessment.

Conclusions

If confirmed in prospective studies, this less-restrictive risk classification strategy could be used to safely identify chest pain patients with more traditional cardiac risk factors for early emergency department release.

Single high-sensitivity troponin T — diagnostic performance in low-risk cohorts is quantified: In 1,138 patients, almost one third had a troponin level less than 5 ng/L with a sensitivity of 99% (0.3% risk of MACE), whereas using the 99th percentile cutoff of 14 ng/L identified two thirds as negative but sensitivity decreased to 92% (1.3% risk of MACE). A meta-analysis of single results below the limit of detection (< 5 ng/L) in patients with a nonischemic ECG reported across eleven studies and 2,825 patients a pooled sensitivity of MACE at 98%.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^111L8TPT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

No prior studies have evaluated the role of serial TnT or TnI testing in septic patients. The current investigation demonstrated that elevated admission TnT predicted higher short‐ and long‐term mortality without an incremental prognostic benefit of serial TnT testing in these patients. The presence or absence of cardiac injury, as defined by elevated admission TnT level, appears to be more relevant than the magnitude of cardiac injury, as defined by delta TnT levels. Nonetheless, log 10 TnT values had an independent linear association with short‐ and long‐term mortality.

Despite its increasingly frequent recognition, the etiopathogenesis of TnT elevation in sepsis remains unclear. 5 Flow‐limiting coronary artery disease is infrequently documented in these patients, alluding to alternate mechanisms of TnT elevation other than AMI. 8 Electrocardiography and echocardiography in these patients rarely demonstrate ischemic changes, and few patients have inducible ischemia on stress testing or occlusive coronary thrombus on autopsy. 8, 26, 30 Postulated causes for troponin elevations in septic patients include ischemic mechanisms (eg, supply–demand imbalance or microvascular spasm or thrombosis) and nonischemic mechanisms (eg, reversible myocardial membrane leakage of cytosolic TnT pool or direct cellular toxicity from inflammatory mediators, microbial toxins, or excessive catecholamine levels). 7, 31, 32 While relative hypovolemia, inadequate resuscitation, and prolonged hypotension may contribute to myocardial injury in patients with septic shock, fluid resuscitation does not appear to influence the subsequent values of hs‐TnT on serial testing. 12

A characteristic rise and fall of TnT in the presence of ischemic symptoms or other evidence of myocardial ischemia defines AMI. Ischemia is often difficult to identify in critically ill patients, adding to uncertainty regarding the need for serial measurement of TnT. 33 This study identified a significant delta TnT in one fifth of patients with elevated admission TnT, yet this carried no incremental prognostic value. The slow downslope of the time–concentration curve for TnT complicates interpretation of single TnT values or delta TnT values when the sampling time is not consistent with respect to sepsis onset time. A changing pattern of results is documented early after events when the concentration–time curve is rising, but subsequently even AMI does not always manifest a recognizable changing pattern of values. 34 Thus, it is unclear how strong this consideration is for clinical care in the population with sepsis and septic shock, which could confound our assessment of this cardiac biomarker in the critically ill population.

### The electrocardiogram for sepsis: how close are we? [^111ehto8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

In daily clinical practice the diagnosis of sepsis is imprecise and often delayed. In part, this is because the diagnosis is based on a clinical picture of signs and symptoms. This basis has significant implications, as there is evidence that early events in sepsis may determine outcome. A more objective set of measurements for confirming the diagnosis of sepsis has long been sought. Several sepsis biomarkers have been evaluated and shown to have a moderate degree of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of bacterial infection. Efforts are now being directed toward evaluating the utility of biomarker profiles, containing multiple markers, for risk assessment and diagnosis in patients with suspected sepsis.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^111BS9fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

During this 8‐year period, 1757 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were admitted to the ICUs at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Sixty‐nine (3.9%) patients did not have research authorization, and 744 (42.4%) did not have a measured TnT, leaving a final study population of 944 (53.7%) patients. Baseline characteristics and unadjusted outcomes of patients with and without measured TnT are presented in Table 1. Patients in whom TnT was measured had greater baseline cardiovascular comorbidity and higher severity of illness at ICU admission. Of the 944 patients with a measured admission TnT, 845 (89.5%) had elevated admission TnT ≥ 0.01 ng/mL, with a median TnT of 0.06 (interquartile range 0.03–0.14) ng/mL. Baseline characteristics of the cohorts with and without TnT elevation are detailed in Table 2. Patients with elevated admission TnT were older and had higher rates of coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and baseline comorbidity. Patients with elevated TnT had higher severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score) and received less fluid resuscitation during their ICU stay; there were no differences in the vasopressor or ventilatory requirements between the 2 cohorts.

### Troponin elevation in coronary vs. non-coronary disease [^114af43e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction is defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Cardiac troponins (cTn) are the most sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury and with the new high-sensitivity troponin methods very minor damages on the heart muscle can be detected. However, elevated cTn levels indicate cardiac injury, but do not define the cause of the injury. Thus, cTn elevations are common in many disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the clinical work it may be difficult to interpret dynamic changes of troponin in conditions such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute perimyocarditis, Tako-tsubo, acute heart failure, and tachycardia. There are no guidelines to treat patients with elevated cTn levels and no coronary disease. The current strategy of treatment of patients with elevated troponin and non-acute coronary syndrome involves treating the underlying causes. The aim of this paper is to review data from studies of non-ACS patients with acutely elevated troponin who in clinical practice may be difficult to discriminate from ACS patients.

Because of the skewed nature of admission TnT values, these values were converted to log 10 TnT for continuous analyses (Figure 4). Unadjusted admission log 10 TnT was associated with higher in‐hospital (OR 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2–2.1]; P = 0.003) and 1‐year mortality (OR 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1–1.7]; P = 0.04). Admission log 10 TnT did not demonstrate a significant correlation with ICU (estimate −0.18, SE 0.30; P = 0.55) or hospital length of stay (estimate 1.12, SE 0.94; P = 0.23). In a multivariate model using logistic regression, admission log 10 TnT remained an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (unit OR 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–2.1]; P = 0.04, Table 3). Using Cox proportional hazards model, admission log 10 TnT was an independent predictor of 1‐year survival (hazard ratio 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1–1.6]; P = 0.008, Table 3).

Classification, evaluation, and management of myocardial injury — myocardial injury is defined as any cardiac troponin (cTn) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), and it is acute when there is a dynamic rise and/or fall exceeding assay variation (> 20% relative change) with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile; chronic injury remains elevated but stable on serial measurements. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) requires both acute myocardial injury and evidence of myocardial ischemia, which can be met by the following: symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, new pathological Q waves, new ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities on cardiac imaging, or acute coronary thrombus/erosion on invasive coronary angiography. Five distinct MI subtypes are noted; type 1 MI occurs due to acute plaque disruption, and type 2 MI is due to myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch in the absence of atherothrombosis, with type 2 MI requiring symptoms, ECG changes, new wall motion abnormalities, or coronary angiographic findings to be considered an MI. Table 5 organizes the differential by acute myocardial injury (rising and/or falling cardiac troponin) versus chronic myocardial injury (stable elevation in cardiac troponin) across cardiovascular causes and noncardiovascular causes.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^113K1ac5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

HEART score versus HEART pathway in low-risk chest pain — In derivation work, the HEART score incorporated a single conventional (not high-sensitivity) troponin measure, and, although rare, patients with an elevated troponin level can have a low-risk score, and the HEART score can indicate low risk in patients with acute ischemic changes on ECG or known CAD. In contrast, the HEART pathway is an accelerated diagnostic protocol, which uses a modified-HEART (mHEART) score and serial troponin measurements; to be low risk by the HEART pathway, patients must meet all of the following criteria: a HEART score of 0–3, no troponin elevation on serial testing, no ischemic ECG changes, and no prior CAD (prior MI, CABG, or PCI). Implementation of the HEART pathway is associated with decreased hospitalizations and death and MACE rates ≤ 0.5% among low-risk patients, which meets the international standard for 'acceptable' clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Mayo Clinic Rochester and was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study. The study population included a historical cohort of all consecutive adult ICU admissions for severe sepsis and septic shock from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2014. This study was designed and conducted before the publication of recently updated sepsis definitions, so the 2001 American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus criteria were used to define sepsis. 1 Severe sepsis was defined as consequent organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension, and septic shock was defined as hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation of 30 mL/kg body weight. Hypoperfusion was defined as blood lactate level ≥ 2.3 mmol/L, organ dysfunction as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 2, and hypotension as systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg or a reduction of ≤ 40 mm Hg from baseline. 15 Patients with denial of research authorization, readmissions for severe sepsis, known pregnancy, and lack of available TnT levels were excluded from this study.

Cardiac TnT was measured with the fourth‐generation TnT electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using the Roche Cobas e411 analyzer. The 99th percentile of upper reference limit value for this assay is < 0.01 ng/mL and the 10% coefficient of variability value is 0.035 ng/mL. Admission TnT values were defined as the first measured TnT level within 6 hours of ICU admission. An elevated admission TnT level was defined as TnT ≥ 0.01 ng/mL consistent with the assay used and prior data from our center. 6, 16 A significant delta TnT level was defined as a rise in 3‐ and 6‐hour TnT ≥ 0.03 ng/mL compared with the admission TnT value. A delta TnT of > 0.03 ng/mL exceeds the coefficient of variability for this assay, defining a change that cannot occur because of the imprecision of assay alone.

Acute chest pain risk scores — HEART, EDACS, and ADAPT performance and criteria: In a randomized clinical trial of the HEART pathway versus standard care among 282 patients with possible ACS, there was a 12% reduction in objective cardiac testing at 30 days (P = 0.048). A U.S. implementation study reported that a HEART score ≤ 3 combined with a nonischemic ECG and 0- and 3-hour cTn < 99th percentile identified 30.7% of patients as low risk and eligible for early discharge, with a 30-day rate of death or MI of 0.4%. EDACS requires a nonischemic ECG and serial conventional cTn values < 99th percentile over 2 hours, and validation studies in the United States demonstrate a 30-day major adverse cardiac event rate of ≤ 1% in those classified as low risk. The 2-Hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Assess Patients With Chest Pain Symptoms Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarker (ADAPT) pathway uses a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score of 0, a nonischemic ECG, and 0- and 2- hour cTn concentrations < 99th percentile to identify low-risk patients with a 30-day major adverse cardiac event risk < 1%, but with less efficacy than the HEART and EDACS pathways.

### Identifying survivors of sepsis at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes [^115BP7zh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated troponin levels are found in approximately 50% of critically ill patients and have been associated with adverse outcomes. Hence, elevated troponin levels may be useful for future risk stratification in survivors of sepsis as suggested by this study. However, the appropriate troponin cutoff levels remain to be determined. There are legitimate concerns that indiscriminate troponin testing or use of highly sensitive assays will return many positive results of uncertain clinical significance that may result in subsequent procedures and treatments of questionable therapeutic value. Among the 39,590 eligible patients in this study, only a third had troponins drawn during hospitalization and were ultimately included in this study (see Figure 1 in the article by Garcia and colleagues). Speculating about the factors behind the clinical decision to obtain a troponin level versus not is intriguing, and one wonders how the 25,544 patients who did not have a troponin level measured differed from patients included in this study who did and had "normal" levels. Comparing cardiovascular outcomes in such groups will be necessary on the path forward to validating troponin and determining appropriate cutoff values for long-term cardiovascular risk prognostication in survivors of sepsis.

In conclusion, the association of increased troponin levels with adverse incident cardiovascular outcomes after sepsis is an intriguing finding that may signal a significant step toward identifying survivors of sepsis at high-risk for these outcomes. Future studies will show whether troponin levels alone or perhaps in combination with other biomarkers (e.g. markers of persistent inflammation or immunosuppression) will accurately identify patients that may benefit from targeted preventative interventions after hospital discharge.

### The etiology and prognostic significance of cardiac troponin I elevation in unselected emergency department patients [^116Bi9LA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin elevations are associated not only with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but also with multiple other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.

Study Objectives

To investigate the etiology and clinical significance of cardiac troponin I elevations in an unselected Emergency Department (ED) patient cohort.

Methods

The study population consisted of 991 consecutive troponin-positive patients admitted to the ED of a university hospital with ACS as the presumptive diagnosis. Cardiac troponin I was measured on admission and a follow-up sample was obtained at 6–12 h. Clinical diagnosis was ascertained retrospectively using all the available information including electrocardiogram, clinical data, laboratory tests, and available coronary angiograms.

Results

At admission, 805 (81.2%) patients were already troponin positive; of these, the troponin elevation was related to myocardial infarction (MI) in 654 (81.2%) patients. Finally, 83.0% of the troponin elevations were due to MI, 7.9% were related to other cardiac causes, and 9.1% to non-cardiac diseases. The leading non-cardiac causes were pulmonary embolism, renal failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Non-cardiac patients with elevated troponin I at admission showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality (26.7% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.002) compared to cardiac patients.

Conclusion

Elevated troponin levels for reasons other than MI are common in the ED and are a marker of poor in-hospital prognosis.

### A prospective study of the impact of serial troponin measurements on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and hospital and six-month mortality in patients admitted to ICU with non-cardiac diagnoses [^117SjFtp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a sensitive and specific marker of myocardial injury and is firmly established in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Troponin elevation is common in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (12 to 85%) and associated with increased morbidity, mortality and length of stay. There are multiple potential aetiologies of troponin rises, including cardiac causes, such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), MI, heart failure and pericarditis/myocarditis, and non-cardiac causes, such as sepsis, pulmonary disease, renal impairment and intracranial events, but MI and sepsis are the most important causes in this patient cohort.

There is evidence that the mechanism of troponin release and the prognostic significance of an elevated troponin level vary depending on the underlying cause. In patients with severe sepsis, troponin release can occur in the absence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease and may be due to transient loss in membrane integrity with subsequent troponin leakage or microvascular thrombotic injury. Ver Elst et al. performed post-mortem examinations in patients with septic shock and found similar non-specific changes in troponin positive and troponin negative patients, including elongated myocardial fibers and interstitial oedema but no evidence of MI. Other studies not restricted to sepsis showed that 36 to 71% of patients with elevated troponin levels had ischaemic changes on electrocardiogram (ECG), which therefore defines them as MIs by the consensus criteria.

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of MI in ICU patients is complicated by the frequent absence of clinical symptoms, the presence of confounding comorbidities and the difficulty of interpreting ECG changes and troponin elevation in the context of critical illness. Two studies by Lim et al. conducted at a single centre, found that MI, as defined by raised troponin levels and contemporaneous ischaemic ECG changes, occurred in 26 to 36% of ICU patients. Hospital mortality in patients with MI was 43%, compared to 27% in those with elevated troponin only. More than half of the MIs diagnosed by prospective screening were missed by the clinical team, although the associated mortality was similar irrespective of whether the events were recognised or not (39% vs. 35% ICU mortality and 50% vs. 35% hospital mortality, respectively, with non-significant P -values).

### Impact of elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis recognition on the clinical outcomes: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^112QYtR8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Sepsis, a life‐threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, imposes a significant health care burden due to high morbidity and mortality. Although sepsis can affect any organ system, the heart is particularly vulnerable. Such cardiac involvement, termed septic cardiomyopathy, is a common complication characterized by left ventricular dilation and decreased function, and contributes to increased mortality. Diagnosis is typically conducted via echocardiography, and treatment focuses on infection control and supportive care.

Cardiac troponins (I and T) serve as sensitive and specific markers for myocardial injury, offering valuable insights for early risk stratification across various clinical settings. In patients with sepsis, troponin levels are frequently elevated and associated with increased mortality. However, the role of troponin elevation in risk stratification remains controversial. Recent meta‐analyses suggest a significant association between troponin elevation and increased mortality in patients with sepsis, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of this relationship. However, previous studies suffer from small sample sizes and insufficient characterization of cohorts of patients with sepsis. Moreover, lack of consideration of confounding variables introduces selection bias, complicating the interpretation of troponin levels in this population.

In this study, we aim to overcome these limitations by using data from the Korea Sepsis Alliance, a prospective sepsis cohort. We investigated the relationships between elevated troponin levels at sepsis recognition and the clinical outcomes of sepsis. Furthermore, we examined changes in organ dysfunction over 1‐week periods, comparing patients with elevated troponin at sepsis recognition to those without.

Introduction

The cardiac Troponin test has a key role in the diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Over utilization and inappropriate requests for it have created a heavy workload for laboratory staff, increased costs to the health care system, and unnecessarily increased the length of stay and costs for patients. The aim of this study was to make and standardize all requests of Troponin more accurate and scientific without causing any burden to the patients, doctors or laboratory section.

Methods

A total number of 1073 requested serum Troponin-T Tests in the Emergency department)ED) of Hamad General hospital were reviewed retrospectively during the period from start of October/2014 to end of December /2014, then a data analysis was done including sex, race, age, a proper history taking and physical examination in addition to electrocardiographic (ECG) records and any necessary aid can be helpful before making any decision for Troponin request, then our results were compared to other studies and international results.

Results

Out of 1073 involved cases, there were only 208 patients with elevated serum Troponin-T levels, representing about 19.38%, those whom were proved to have acute coronary syndrome were only 83, representing 7.7% from the whole studied cases, (having a cardiac cause for their chest pain). Although patients who describe chest pain to the emergency physician represent an immediate challenge, but still we conclude that there is over utilization of Troponin test which increases workload and costs.

Conclusions

The majority of chest pain complaints are not due to (ACS). Non-cardiac chest pain is the second most common reason presentation to the ED and accounts for approximately 2 to 5 percent of all visits worldwide. Unnecessary and inappropriate requests for serum troponin should be reduced. The reduction in these requests eases the workload, cuts test and labor costs. Reducing unnecessary testing can lead to shortening stay times also beneficial for patients.

Acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — troponin sampling, prior testing, and single-sample rule-out: In patients for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, repeat measurements after the initial sample are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays. Institutions should implement a clinical decision pathway (CDP) with a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, and previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs. For patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

### Circulating high sensitivity troponin T in severe sepsis and septic shock: distribution, associated factors, and relation to outcome [^115S19C5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock are commonly complicated by myocardial dysfunction, even in patients without pre-existing coronary artery disease, and cardiac failure may contribute to poor outcome in these patients. Early recognition of myocardial injury and ventricular dysfunction in severe sepsis and septic shock may improve short-term prognosis, but is difficult to diagnose.

Cardiac troponins T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are components of the myofibrillar contractile apparatus of cardiomyocytes. Measurement of troponins is routinely used for diagnosis of myocardial necrosis in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and to identify patients benefiting from early medical and coronary interventions. Recently, several studies have also reported detectable cTnT or cTnI levels in patients with sepsis, but their predictive value has not been firmly established. Explanations for the diverging results regarding utility of troponin testing in sepsis may be inadequate sample size and use of troponin assays with limited sensitivity and precision in the low concentration range. However, a new and highly sensitive assay for cTnT (hs-cTnT) measurement now allows detection of concentrations tenfold lower than with previous assays. The clinical benefit of using this novel hs-cTnT assay has been demonstrated in patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function, as the hs-cTnT assay detected measurable levels of troponin T in 97.7% of these patients, and improved risk stratification beyond standard patient evaluation. In contrast, only 1.3% of these patients would have had measurable levels of cTnT with the conventional fourth-generation assay.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that hs-cTnT would be detectable in a high proportion of patients with sepsis or septic shock, be associated with conventional risk markers in sepsis, and provide superior prognostic information compared to a conventional fourth-generation cTnT assay.

Intermediate-risk patients — using ESC 0/1-hour or ESC 0/2-hour algorithms, approximately 25% of patients will be classified as at intermediate risk and may require additional observation and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) measurement 3 to 6 hours later. Many will undergo predischarge noninvasive testing, a subset may be sufficiently low risk to consider discharge without inpatient testing, and close follow-up is recommended, preferably within 7 days.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^116m9Cde]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Troponin-T elevation is seen commonly in sepsis and septic shock patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We sought to evaluate the role of admission and serial troponin-T testing in the prognostication of these patients.

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective cohort study from 2007 to 2014 on patients admitted to the intensive care units at the Mayo Clinic with severe sepsis and septic shock. Elevated admission troponin-T and significant delta troponin-T were defined as ≥ 0.01 ng/mL and ≥ 0.03 ng/mL in 3 hours, respectively. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1-year mortality and lengths of stay. During this 8-year period, 944 patients met the inclusion criteria with 845 (90%) having an admission troponin-T ≥ 0.01 ng/mL. Serial troponin-T values were available in 732 (78%) patients. Elevated admission troponin-T was associated with older age, higher baseline comorbidity, and severity of illness, whereas significant delta troponin-T was associated with higher severity of illness. Admission log 10 troponin-T was associated with unadjusted in-hospital (odds ratio 1.6; P = 0.003) and 1-year mortality (odds ratio 1.3; P = 0.04), but did not correlate with length of stay. Elevated delta troponin-T and log 10 delta troponin-T were not significantly associated with any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Admission log 10 troponin-T remained an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.4; P = 0.04) and 1-year survival (hazard ratio 1.3; P = 0.008).

Conclusions

In patients with sepsis and septic shock, elevated admission troponin-T was associated with higher short- and long-term mortality. Routine serial troponin-T testing did not add incremental prognostic value in these patients.

### Prognostic value of troponins in sepsis: a meta-analysis [^113bMkoq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

The role of biomarkers such as troponin in risk stratification of sepsis is still debated. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the relation between troponin elevation in sepsis and mortality.

Methods

All observational studies from Embase, Medline and those manually searched up to September 2010 were included. Studies identified were those which reported on patients with a diagnosis of sepsis and if a 2 × 2 table could be constructed based on troponins and death. We pooled the relative risk (RR) and odds-ratio (OR) using the inverse variance method in studies that conducted univariate and multivariable (adjusted) analysis.

Main Results

Thirteen studies encompassing 1,227 patients were included. The prevalence of elevated troponin was 61% ([95%] CI 58–64%). Elevated troponin was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (RR 1.91; CI 1.63–2.24), with homogeneity across studies. In adjusted analysis (four studies comprising 791 patients) according to prognostic scores, elevated troponin was associated with an increased risk of death (OR 1.92; CI 1.35–2.74). The area under the ROC curve was 0.68 (CI 0.63–0.71). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 77% (CI 61–88) and 47% (CI 30–64) with heterogeneity across studies. It corresponded to positive and negative likelihood ratios of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.20–1.90) and 0.49 (CI 0.38–0.64), respectively.

Conclusions

Elevated troponin identifies a subset of patients with sepsis at higher risk of death. Further studies are needed to define the precise role of troponins and their optimal cut-offs.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin change thresholds and prior testing definitions — Evidence-based criteria do not exist to define change thresholds for hs-cTn at the 3- to 6.0-hour timepoint; although a 20% relative change from the baseline measurement has been proposed to define significant change, this threshold lacks specificity at low hs-cTn values in part due to assay imprecision; therefore, at lower hs-cTn values near the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), absolute changes should be used to define clinically-significant change, whereas at higher troponin values, a 20% relative change in values may be a more reasonable threshold; clinical judgment is needed to interpret small fluctuations in hs-cTn values over serial measurements; recent normal testing is considered an invasive or CT coronary angiogram < 2 years without evidence of coronary plaque or a stress test < 1 year without ischemia.

Algorithm for intermediate-risk patients — Emergency department observation zone care includes to repeat high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) at 3–6 hours, perform risk stratification with modified History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) score or Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS), and review prior testing; patients with no or minimal increase in hs-cTn from last measured value and any of the following — recent normal testing, chronic elevations in hs-cTn that are similar to levels measured previously, or low modified HEART score (≤ 3) or EDACS (< 16) — are reclassified as lower risk and consider discharge with outpatient noninvasive testing in selected patients (see Section 5.8); if any of the following are present — significant increase in hs-cTn from last measured value, ongoing or recurrent chest pain concerning for ischemia, or new ECG findings consistent with ischemia — patients are reclassified as abnormal/higher risk and classify as per Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI) (see Section 5.7); those not meeting criteria to reclassify to lower- or higher-risk categories should consider noninvasive testing before discharge (see Section 5.6).

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^112W1ABT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^114Vr7k9]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponins are sensitive and specific biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. We evaluated troponin, CK, and ECG abnormalities in patients with septic shock and compared the effect of vasopressin (VP) versus norepinephrine (NE) on troponin, CK, and ECGs.

Methods

This was a prospective substudy of a randomized trial. Adults with septic shock randomly received, blinded, a low-dose infusion of VP (0.01 to 0.03 U/min) or NE (5 to 15 μg/min) in addition to open-label vasopressors, titrated to maintain a mean blood pressure of 65 to 75 mm Hg. Troponin I/T, CK, and CK-MB were measured, and 12-lead ECGs were recorded before study drug, and 6 hours, 2 days, and 4 days after study-drug initiation. Two physician readers, blinded to patient data and drug, independently interpreted ECGs.

Results

We enrolled 121 patients (median age, 63.9 years (interquartile range (IQR), 51.1 to 75.3), mean APACHE II 28.6 (SD 7.7)): 65 in the VP group and 56 in the NE group. At the four time points, 26%, 36%, 32%, and 21% of patients had troponin elevations, respectively. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were similar between patients with positive versus negative troponin levels. Troponin and CK levels and rates of ischemic ECG changes were similar in the VP and the NE groups. In multivariable analysis, only APACHE II was associated with 28-day mortality (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.033).

Conclusions

Troponin elevation is common in adults with septic shock. We observed no significant differences in troponin, CK, and ECGs in patients treated with vasopressin and norepinephrine. Troponin elevation was not an independent predictor of mortality.

### 40th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 24–27 March 2020 [^11593hiu]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods:

We enrolled 101 patients with sepsis and mean SOFA score 5,2 respectively in which cTnT level was measured more than once and analyzed there ECG and Echo findings. Patients were classified into three groups:definite MI (rise and fall cTnT ≥ 20% and contemporaneous changes on ECG and/or Echo), possible MI (rise and fall cTnT ≥ 20% and no other findings), myocardial injury (cTnT rise less than 20%)

Results:

Data from 101 patients were analyzed (49% female; mean age 61.9 (SD 16.9)). A total of 101 patients had at least one elevated cTnT more than 0.03 mkg/l. In 71 (70%) of patients cTnT level rised more than 20% from the first elevated measurement.64 (63%) of patients met MI criteria considering new ECG and Echo findings. The overall mortality rate in all patients was 53.9%. The mortality rate didn't differ significantly in three groups: in the definite MI group 62.4%, in the suspected MI group 52%, in the non MI cTnT elevation group 56,4%, p = 0,6. Coronary angiography was performed in 46 (73%) of patients from the definite MI group, PCI was performed in 18 (39%) of patients. The mortality rate in the invasive group was not significantly lower comparing to the nonivasive group 29% vs 37,8%, p = 0,06. Bleeding complications were significantly more frequent in the definite MI group 13% vs 7% and 8% respectively

Conclusions:

cTnT level elevation is associated with poor outcome regardless coronary or non coronary injury. Myocardial revascularization may be beneficial in patients with sepsis and definite MI, but it is also associated with increased bleeding risk.

Acute chest pain — risk-based disposition with the clinical decision pathway specifies that those "assigned to the abnormal/high-risk category" "should be further classified according to the Universal Definition of MI into type 1 or 2 MI or acute or chronic nonischemic cardiac injury", and "High-risk patients should usually be admitted to an inpatient setting for further evaluation and treatment". For intermediate risk, patients "should undergo additional observation with repeat hs-cTn measurements at 3 to 6 hours and risk assessment using either the modified History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) score or the ED Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS)", and "Noninvasive testing should be considered for the intermediate-risk group unless low-risk features are identified using risk scores or noninvasive testing has been performed recently with normal or low-risk findings".

### Association between troponin-I levels and outcome in critically ill patients admitted to non-cardiac intensive care unit with high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors [^112cyth5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Another difference is that Lim et al. systematic review suggested an association between troponin elevation and length of ICU stay, while our study did not demonstrate such an association.

Our study indicated a level-dependent association of troponin-I elevation with hospital mortality in patients who were less than 50 years of age, those not on vasopressors, and who were non-diabetics. These findings are surprising and may, at first, appear to be counterintuitive. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with studies that showed no association between troponin-I and mortality in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis and in elderly ill patients presenting to the Emergency Department. The observed increased mortality in patients who were less than 50 years of age and non-diabetics is consistent with the findings of Lim and Whitlock which showed that patients with elevated troponin levels for other than myocardial infarction had a worse outcome compared to those who did have myocardial infarction; with diabetes and old age being two of the most significant risk factors for myocardial infarction. Although our study did not distinguish between elevated troponin-I levels caused by myocardial infarction or due to other known causes of troponin-I elevation (e.g. sepsis, hypovolemic shock, pulmonary embolism or inflammatory mediator related myocardial cell injury), it is plausible that it takes a significant injury to the myocardium in patients with lower cardiovascular risk such as those who are young patients, not on vasopressors and non-diabetics, to cause troponin-I elevation compared to patients with higher cardiovascular risk factors such as older patients, on vasopressors and with diabetes. This finding needs further validation in future studies. Based on current data, troponin measurement in critically ill patients may have prognostic value, but whether it can guide specific therapeutic interventions remains unknown and will need to be tested in randomized controlled trial.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction… [^113zV6Wm]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Patients were stratified by time of onset of symptoms and according to cardiac troponin concentration at presentation. Individual patient concentrations are shown with box and whisker distribution and probability density plots. Peak concentration is the highest troponin concentration obtained on serial sampling. The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. 1 Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing.

2 These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, 3, 4 but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed. Patients presenting within 2 hours of symptom onset had lower troponin concentrations and were more likely to have concentrations at less than the 99th percentile, compared with those presenting later. Posterior STEMI was more common in patients presenting with troponin at less than the 99th percentile. Despite significant advances in the sensitivity of cardiac troponin testing, more than 1 in 4 patients with STEMI have troponin concentrations at less than the ESC-recommended rule-in threshold at presentation.

Patients presenting within 2 hours were more likely to have a troponin concentration at less than the 99th percentile; however, even in those who presented later, 1 in 6 had troponin concentrations at less than the diagnostic threshold.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^112LjfVh]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Our example patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with shortness of breath due to acute pneumonia complicating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A transient elevation of troponin to a level three times the upper limits of normal occurred following a period of hypotension and hypoxia while he was septic. He had constant diffuse chest pains since he first felt ill, and his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with lateral T wave inversion, unchanged from prior ECGs. His shortness of breath was attributed to his pulmonary disease, and no coronary intervention performed. He recovered to where he could be discharged, and further cardiac evaluation was deferred to the discretion of his primary care provider following further recovery from his acute illness. The problem is how best to describe the episode for purposes of documentation and subsequent follow-up.

There is no ICD-9 code to document myocardial injury (as evidenced by transient elevations in cardiac biomarkers) that occurs because of severe extra-cardiac problems such as sepsis, but according to the new Universal Definition of MI, this can be called a TYPE 2 MI. Having this diagnosis available is a definitive improvement compared with the 2000 ESC/ACC consensus on redefinition of MI. The 2000 document stated that 'any amount of myocardial necrosis caused by ischaemia should be labeled as MI'. This statement implied that a typical rise and fall of troponin alone was adequate to make the diagnosis of acute, evolving, or recent MI. In the final (2000) summary, it was stated that the rise and fall in biomarkers should be accompanied by at least one additional finding (symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging findings as noted above). However, this inconsistency left an open question as to when a transient biomarker elevation such as that just described constitutes an MI, and what to label it if it is not an MI.

### Cardiac troponin for assessment of myocardial injury in COVID-19: JACC review topic of the week [^113Bzomj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Increases in cardiac troponin indicative of myocardial injury are common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with adverse outcomes such as arrhythmias and death. These increases are more likely to occur in those with chronic cardiovascular conditions and in those with severe COVID-19 presentations. The increased inflammatory, prothrombotic, and procoagulant responses following severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increase the risk for acute nonischemic myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction, particularly type 2 myocardial infarction, because of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hemodynamic instability in critically ill patients. Myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from SARS-CoV-2 are important etiologies, but primary noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis, probably cause more of the myocardial injury. The structured use of serial cardiac troponin has the potential to facilitate risk stratification, help make decisions about when to use imaging, and inform stage categorization and disease phenotyping among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Impact of elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis recognition on the clinical outcomes: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^115bamsJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis‐induced cardiac dysfunction, known as septic cardiomyopathy, is a common complication associated with increased mortality. Cardiac troponins serve as markers for myocardial injury and are frequently elevated in patients with sepsis. However, the role of troponin elevation at sepsis recognition in risk stratification remains controversial.

Methods and Results

This nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study analyzed 2141 adult patients with sepsis without prior cardiovascular disease from the Korean Sepsis Alliance registry. These patients were classified as having either elevated troponin levels or troponin levels in the normal range at the time of sepsis recognition, according to the reference ranges specific to each participating institution. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and propensity score matching was used to control for confounding factors. In the propensity score‐matched cohort (523 pairs), there were no significant differences in hospital mortality (35.2% versus 32.7%, odds ratio [OR], 1.12 [95% CI, 0.86–1.44], P = 0.396), hospital length of stay (13.0 versus 15.0 days, OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99–1.00], P = 0.128), intensive care unit mortality (24.7% versus 25.0%, OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.74–1.30], P = 0.886), or intensive care unit length of stay between the elevated troponin and control groups. However, landmark analysis revealed that the elevated troponin group had a lower survival probability after 1 week (log‐rank P = 0.033) and significantly higher kidney Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores from intensive care unit admission to day 7 (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Troponin elevation at sepsis recognition was not significantly associated with increased hospital mortality or worse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^116MwESE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A significant association between TnT levels and various markers of renal insufficiency was present, but the prognostic significance of TnT for in‐hospital mortality was independent of renal function, and excluding patients with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction did not change the nature of our results (results not demonstrated). Cardiac TnT and TnI have been previously evaluated in patients with renal disease including end‐stage renal disease, but further dedicated studies are needed to guide the interpretation of the individual troponin subtypes in patients with sepsis and kidney dysfunction. 35, 36

This study has several important limitations. Use of a retrospective database carries inherent selection and informational bias in addition to the utilization of an older definition of sepsis that has since been revised. TnT levels were measured in approximately half of the septic population, with evidence of bias toward measuring TnT levels in sicker patients. Therefore, the true epidemiology of TnT elevation among unselected patients with sepsis and septic shock cannot be inferred, nor can determination of whether TnT values influenced clinical care be made. Likewise, one quarter of patients had only a single TnT level measured, limiting the ability to estimate the prevalence of elevated delta TnT. Few patients had downstream cardiac testing such as echocardiography or coronary angiography to help define the incidence of AMI among patients with elevated TnT levels. Our institution uses the TnT assay universally, so conclusions about the incidence and prognostic value of TnI elevations cannot be determined in this cohort. Additionally, since the hs‐TnT assay was approved for use in the United States in 2017, we could not use these assays in our patients. Though the hs‐TnT assay has demonstrated greater sensitivity and negative predictive value in AMI, there are limited data comparing these 2 assays in the septic population. 37 The development of the sepsis‐3 criteria could influence the interpretation of the results of this study. 38 However, this cohort of severe sepsis and septic shock are less likely to be missed with either definition because they comprise the extreme spectrum of illness. 39 The study duration also correlated with the evolution of critical care ultrasonography and changes in healthcare delivery at the Mayo Clinic, both of which conceivably could have influenced our study results. 40, 41 Finally, the single‐region, single‐institution, and referral center nature of the Mayo Clinic could impact the generalizability of findings to other populations.

Rapid 0/1-hour hs-cTn protocols — limitations and modification: Disadvantages include algorithm complexity, sensitivity to timing of blood draws, and relegation of approximately one-quarter of patients to an observation zone with limited evidence for subsequent evaluation and treatment; a modification of the 0/1-hour protocol adds a 3-hour hs-cTn measurement for those in the observation zone and classifies all patients at 3 hours based on hs-cTn changes through 3 hours, although a recent study questioned whether this provides a sufficiently high NPV; late presenters on a descending cTn trend may show little or no change over 1 to 2 hours, and identification requires correlating the clinical presentation with hs-cTn results and considering additional serial hs-cTn measurements.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^116uJVMe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the largest single‐center cohort of patients admitted with severe sepsis and septic shock who had TnT levels measured, this investigation demonstrated that (1) elevated admission TnT was associated with higher baseline comorbidity, higher severity of illness, and multiorgan dysfunction; (2) elevated admission TnT was associated with higher unadjusted 1‐year mortality, but not higher in‐hospital mortality; (3) admission log 10 TnT was independently associated with in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality on multivariate analysis; and (4) elevated delta TnT was associated with unadjusted in‐hospital mortality but was no longer significant on multivariate analysis.

Prior studies on sepsis and septic shock have presented conflicting data on the association of clinical outcomes with troponin elevation. The timing of troponin measurement, troponin assay used (ie, TnT versus TnI), and hemodynamic stability at the time of troponin measurement differ substantially in prior studies. 2, 7, 8 The majority of prior studies have examined short‐term mortality, while this study included assessment of 1‐year death rate. The importance of longer follow‐up is underscored by the finding that TnT levels predicted both in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality. The skewed distribution of TnT values significantly affects the results when not using log‐transformed TnT values.

### An emergency medicine approach to troponin elevation due to causes other than occlusion myocardial infarction [^111zidQy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Troponin is an integral component of the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, troponin may be elevated in conditions other than OMI.

Objective

This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with a focused evaluation of troponin elevation in patients with myocardial injury due to conditions other than OMI.

Discussion

ACS includes the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), which incorporates assessment for elevated troponin. Troponin I and T are the most common biomarkers used in assessment of myocardial injury and may be released with myocyte injury and necrosis, myocyte apoptosis and cell turnover, and oxygen supply demand mismatch. Troponin elevation is a reflection of myocardial injury, and many conditions associated with critical illness may result in troponin elevation. These include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Cardiac conditions include heart failure, dysrhythmia, and dissection, while non-cardiac causes include pulmonary embolism, sepsis, stroke, and many others. Clinicians should consider the clinical context, patient symptoms, electrocardiogram, and ultrasound in their assessment of the patient with troponin elevation. In most cases, elevated troponin is a marker for poor outcomes including increased rates of mortality.

Conclusions

Troponin can be elevated in many critical settings. The causes of troponin elevation include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Clinicians must consider the clinical context and other factors, as an inappropriate diagnosis of OMI may result in patient harm and misdiagnosis of another condition.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) observation — serial measurement protocol and downstream actions are specified: serial hs-cTn measurements over 3 to 6 hours are required, with a significant rise identifying acute myocardial injury and possibly MI; if hs-cTn is unchanged, patient selection for additional noninvasive testing should consider prior testing, symptom likelihood of ACS, historical hs-cTn, risk scores, and access to rapid follow-up, and if discharged without testing, early follow-up is recommended.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^113AUp6p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The Mayo Clinic Multidisciplinary Epidemiology and Translational Research in Intensive Care Laboratory ICU DataMart has comprehensive ICU data and uses previously validated electronic search algorithms for detection of sepsis and septic shock. 17, 18, 19 Data were electronically abstracted from the electronic health record using validated search algorithms as previously described. 20, 21 Laboratory, imaging, and physiological parameters closest to ICU admission were abstracted. The severity of illness was measured using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Mortality data were abstracted from the Mayo Clinic databases, the state of Minnesota electronic death certificates, and the Rochester Epidemiology Project death data system. 22 Two independent reviewers (SV, MK) performed manual chart reviews to ensure accuracy and fidelity of data when needed.

The primary outcome was in‐hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included 1‐year mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. In all patients, these outcomes were compared in patients with and without significant TnT elevation and between admission TnT quartiles. In patients with serial TnT measurements, these outcomes were compared across groups based on presence or absence of elevated admission and delta TnT levels.

### Impact of elevated troponin level at the time of sepsis recognition on the clinical outcomes: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^112oje55]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, because the troponin levels recorded were not peak enzyme values but rather measurements at the time of sepsis recognition, they do not fully reflect the extent of cardiac injury in patients with sepsis. In addition, our study analyzed troponin levels only at the time of sepsis recognition, without follow‐up measurements. Although this single time‐point measurement allows for early risk stratification, it does not capture the dynamic changes in cardiac injury that may occur during the course of sepsis. Second, the upper limit of normal for elevated troponin, established from healthy volunteers, may not apply to patients with severe acute conditions, as recent data indicate that the cutoff for these patients could be > 4 times higher. Third, the lack of standardized troponin measurement schemes across participating centers created several limitations. This not only hindered our ability to compare the prognostic value of different troponin cutoff levels, but also prevented us from analyzing important parameters such as the duration of troponin elevation and peak values. Fourth, as an observational cohort study, there is potential for residual confounding despite the use of propensity score matching, and although this method helps balance key characteristics between groups, it may exclude some patients, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Fifth, our use of renal SOFA scores as a measure of kidney dysfunction has inherent limitations. The SOFA scoring system cannot differentiate between acute and chronic kidney disease, which may have influenced our findings regarding renal dysfunction. Although the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria would provide a more accurate assessment of acute kidney injury, the retrospective nature of our study and the lack of baseline creatinine data prevented us from performing this analysis. Finally, the lack of detailed ECG and echocardiographic data in our study restricts our assessment of the link between troponin elevation at sepsis recognition and septic cardiomyopathy, highlighting the need for future studies to include comprehensive echocardiographic assessments to clarify this relationship and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that routine troponin testing at sepsis recognition may not provide additional prognostic value for short‐term outcomes in patients with sepsis without prior cardiovascular disease, despite its widespread use in current clinical practice.

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^112vc2ao]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a common and challenging condition in critical care, demanding precise risk stratification and aggressive management to improve patient outcomes. Cardiac troponins, highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury, are frequently measured in critically ill patients with sepsis. Multiple mechanisms contribute to troponin release in this setting, including supply–demand mismatch, direct myocardial inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and impaired renal clearance. Cardiac involvement in sepsis, often manifested as septic cardiomyopathy with ventricular dysfunction, has been extensively studied. In this context, cardiac troponins are commonly used as biomarkers of myocardial injury.

### A prospective study of the impact of serial troponin measurements on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and hospital and six-month mortality in patients admitted to ICU with non-cardiac diagnoses [^1128awwu]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Troponin T (cTnT) elevation is common in patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and associated with morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to determine the epidemiology of raised cTnT levels and contemporaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) changes suggesting myocardial infarction (MI) in ICU patients admitted for non-cardiac reasons.

Methods

cTnT and ECGs were recorded daily during week 1 and on alternate days during week 2 until discharge from ICU or death. ECGs were interpreted independently for the presence of ischaemic changes. Patients were classified into four groups: (i) definite MI (cTnT ≥ 15 ng/L and contemporaneous changes of MI on ECG), (ii) possible MI (cTnT ≥ 15 ng/L and contemporaneous ischaemic changes on ECG), (iii) troponin rise alone (cTnT ≥ 15 ng/L), or (iv) normal. Medical notes were screened independently by two ICU clinicians for evidence that the clinical teams had considered a cardiac event.

Results

Data from 144 patients were analysed (42% female; mean age 61.9 (SD 16.9)). A total of 121 patients (84%) had at least one cTnT level ≥ 15 ng/L. A total of 20 patients (14%) had a definite MI, 27% had a possible MI, 43% had a cTNT rise without contemporaneous ECG changes, and 16% had no cTNT rise. ICU, hospital and 180-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with a definite or possible MI.

Only 20% of definite MIs were recognised by the clinical team. There was no significant difference in mortality between recognised and non-recognised events.

At the time of cTNT rise, 100 patients (70%) were septic and 58% were on vasopressors. Patients who were septic when cTNT was elevated had an ICU mortality of 28% compared to 9% in patients without sepsis. ICU mortality of patients who were on vasopressors at the time of cTnT elevation was 37% compared to 1.7% in patients not on vasopressors.

Conclusions

The majority of critically ill patients (84%) had a cTnT rise and 41% met criteria for a possible or definite MI of whom only 20% were recognised clinically. Mortality up to 180 days was higher in patients with a cTnT rise.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112JPWow]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Modifications of TIMI score — among emergency department chest pain patients, an accelerated diagnostic pathway (ADP) using a modified TIMI of zero with ECG and troponin I at 0 and 2 hours resulted in greater early discharge with one missed MACE, and studies of repeat troponin testing and altered cutoffs showed variable sensitivity and specificity. A Class II trial randomized 542 patients to standard care versus ADP and the ADP enabled discharge within 6 hours more often (19% versus 11%) with one missed MACE in the ADP group (n = 270). In multicenter data with TIMI 0 to 2, sensitivity with conventional troponins at 0 and 2 hours was 83.9% (95% CI 66.3% to 94.5%), while adding a second troponin plus ECG at 2 hours yielded sensitivity 99.2% (95% CI 97.5% to 99.8%) for 30-day MACE. Modified TIMI cutoffs had mixed performance: at a cutoff of less than or equal to 3, sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI 91.7% to 98.4%) with specificity 51%; at a cutoff of less than or equal to 2, sensitivity was 91% and specificity 54%; in a cohort of 1,758 emergency department patients, cutoffs of less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 2, or less than 3 missed greater than 10% of 30-day MACE. Authors concluded that neither the original nor modified TIMI score is sufficiently sensitive at any score above zero to safely risk-stratify patients even with a normal ECG and troponin, and most authors recommended not relying on TIMI score alone, instead advocating brief observation with repeated troponin testing.

### Cardiac troponins in the intensive care unit: common causes of increased levels and interpretation [^113qE5YB]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Clinical chemistry is an important component of the diagnosis of many conditions, and advances in laboratory science have brought many new diagnostic tools to the intensive care unit clinician, including new biomarkers of cardiac injury like troponin T and I. Interpretation of these clinical laboratory results requires knowledge of the performance of these tests.

Setting and Patients

This article reviews the interpretation and performance of diagnostic markers of myocardial injury in patients with diverse clinical conditions of interest to critical care practitioners.

Conclusions

Cardiac troponin I and T, regulatory components of the contractile apparatus, are sensitive indicators of myocardial injury and have become central to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The troponins are also released in a number of clinical situations in which thrombotic complications of coronary artery disease and resultant acute myocardial infarction have not occurred. These situations include conditions like pulmonary embolism, sepsis, myocarditis, and acute stroke. Elevated troponins in these conditions are thought to emanate from injured myocardial cells and, in most circumstances, have been associated with adverse outcomes. Practitioners should be mindful of the wide spectrum of diseases that may result in elevated troponin when interpreting these measurements.

### Acute coronary syndrome vs nonspecific troponin elevationjamanetwork.com › journals › jamainternalmedicine › fullarticle… [^114RSPeW]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The overall PPV of troponin T for ACS diagnosis was only 56%. The PPV of troponin T level higher than 1. 0 ng/mL in the presence of normal renal function was 90% but was as low as 27% for values of
0. 1 to 1. 0 ng/mL for elderly patients with renal failure. In-hospital and long-term survival rates were significantly better for patients with ACS. Possible mechanisms include the following: mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply in the absence of flow-limiting epicardial stenosis3, 10; imbalance of the autonomic nervous system with resulting excess of sympathetic activity and an increased catecholamine effect on the myocardial cells11; direct myocardial cell injury by traumatic or inflammatory processes; volume and pressure overload resulting in an excessive increase in wall tension with secondary myofibrillary damage12; and impaired renal troponin excretion.
13.

Diagnostic criteria for thrombotic ACS were in accordance with the ESC/ACC guidelines and included a typical rise and fall of cardiac-specific enzyme levels and one of the following: typical ischemic symptoms; electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia; and evidence of significant coronary lesion on coronary angiography. Unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of predictor variables for the diagnosis of ACS. The mean troponin T level was 1. 1 ±
0. 08 ng/mL, the median CPK level was 179 U/L, and the median creatinine level was 1. 09 mg/dL.

The survival analysis further strengthens our conclusion that the NTTE group is truly a distinct subset of patients separate from patients with ACS, since patients with NTTE had a worse prognosis despite the lower levels of troponin T. This is contradictory to the results of the ACS studies and registries, which show a linear correlation between troponin T level and risk of death. 19, 20 As expected, most of the patients with ACS died out of hospital during follow-up, presumably from sudden cardiac death.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to use the following time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements for the evaluation of patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, if serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury:

- 1–3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin

- 3–6 hours for conventional troponin assays.

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^114QKh68]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Looking Ahead: What Should Future Research Prioritize?

The findings by Choi et al, supported by Zheng et al and Jendoubi et al, highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to troponin interpretation in sepsis. Future research should determine whether serial troponin measurements and the trend relative to other biomarkers and renal function, rather than a single time point, better predict clinical outcomes. Investigating troponin's relationship with specific subgroups of patients with sepsis, such as those with concurrent acute kidney injury or chronic cardiovascular disease, will be important. Additionally, establishing clear clinical guidelines on when troponin testing is appropriate in sepsis can help optimize resource use and improve patient management.

While this study offers valuable insights, several limitations warrant consideration. Sepsis is highly heterogeneous, with varying sources of infection and patient comorbidities influencing myocardial risk, troponin levels, and outcomes. Troponin measurements at a single time point may have missed dynamic changes in myocardial injury, while the exclusion of patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease limits generalizability. Additionally, variability in troponin assays across institutions may have led to misclassification, and the lack of echocardiographic data prevents correlation with structural cardiac abnormalities. Moreover, factors beyond myocardial injury, such as renal dysfunction and inflammatory cytokine release, contribute to troponin elevation, complicating a direct causal link to death.

### Significance and interpretation of elevated troponin in septic patients [^116JQX4P]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Because no bedside method is currently available to evaluate myocardial contractility independent of loading conditions, a biological marker that could detect myocardial dysfunction in the early stage of severe sepsis would be a helpful tool in the management of septic patients. Clinical and experimental studies have reported that plasma cardiac troponin levels are increased in sepsis and could indicate myocardial dysfunction and poor outcome. The high prevalence of elevated levels of cardiac troponins in sepsis raises the question of what mechanism results in their release into the circulation. Apart from focal ischemia, several factors may contribute to the microinjury and minimal myocardial cell damage in the setting of septic shock. A possible direct cardiac myocytotoxic effect of endotoxins, cytokines or reactive oxygen radicals induced by the infectious process and produced by activated neutrophils, macrophages and endothelial cells has been postulated. The presence of microvascular failure and regional wall motion abnormalities, which are frequently observed in positive-troponin patients, also suggest ventricular wall strain and cardiac cell necrosis. Altogether, the available studies support the contention that cardiac troponin release is a valuable marker of myocardial injury in patients with septic shock.

High-sensitivity troponin algorithms — stepwise and 0/1-hour protocols and performance are detailed: A stepwise algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I enabled one third of patients to be ruled in or ruled out with the initial value and another one third ruled out with a 2-hour test, totaling 54.6% ruled out for acute MI within 2 hours with an NPV of 99.4% and sensitivity of 97.7% using a high-sensitivity troponin T test. A separate 0- and 1-hour algorithm with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T used rule-out thresholds of an initial level less than 12 ng/L and a 1-hour Δ less than 3 ng/L and rule-in thresholds of an initial level greater than 52 ng/L or a 1-hour Δ greater than 5 ng/L, achieving an NPV of 99.1% but sensitivity of 96.7%, meaning more than 3 patients of every 100 would have false-negative results.

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^116zBTeG]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Generally, all studies on type 2 MI claim to base on the classification in the third universal definition of MI, but there are still vast differences in how the type 2 MI concept is interpreted, especially in relation to myocardial injury. While in some studies, all patients without type 1 MI but with elevated cTn are called type 2 MI, in other studies only myocardial injury caused by the mechanisms that may lead to cardiac oxygen supply/demand mismatch presented in third universal definition of MI are classified as type 2 MI. Some studies even uses specific cut-off values for these mechanisms (eg, tachyarrhythmia > 120 beats per minute) to further sharpen the type 2 MI diagnose. A condition causing much ambiguity is sepsis. In many studies, sepsis is reported as one of the most common causes of type 2 MI. However, according to the third universal definition of MI, the myocardial injury seen in sepsis is not solely related to myocardial ischaemia but rather of a multifactorial nature and should not routinely be classified as type 2 MI. On the other hand, septic shock is postulated as a triggering mechanism of type 2 MI; however, in clinical practice, differentiation between those two conditions may be difficult. Heart failure is another condition causing trouble in this classification. In this study, 78 patients out of 1326 patients had incorrectly received MI diagnose based on elevated cTn levels secondary to heart failure. Elevated cTn in acute heart failure should always raise the suspicion of a type 1 MI, and also indicate an increased wall stress causing either secondary ischaemia or apoptosis and, experimentally demonstrated, also proteolysis of the cardiac contractile apparatus. Cardiac troponins are poor diagnostic markers for an ischaemic versus non-ischaemic aetiology in heart failure. In absence of clinical evidence of ischaemia, the myocardial injury should be regarded as multifactorial. Since both chest discomfort may occur and abnormal ECG findings frequently occur in patients with acute heart failure, assessing the nature of a myocardial injury in this condition constitutes a great clinical challenge.

### Incidence and significance of a positive troponin test in bacteremic patients without acute coronary syndrome [^1142bNR8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of troponin for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, several studies have shown additional conditions in which troponin is elevated, including sepsis. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of an elevated troponin in patients with bacteremia and its significance.

Methods

This was a prospective, noninterventional study. Patients with a positive blood culture were included. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was determined within 4 days of blood culture. A repeat electrocardiogram was obtained in a sample of patients with elevated cTnI and in patients with a negative troponin test. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were obtained for all patients.

Results

A total of 159 bacteremic patients were included. Positive cTnI was detected in 69 patients (43%). Elevated cTnI was associated with a number of underlying diseases, hospitalization ward, severity of the systemic inflammatory condition, and kidney function (P < .05-.001). A repeat electrocardiogram was performed in 39 patients with a positive cTnI and in 28 patients with a negative cTnI. Two of 39 patients (5%) in the positive cTnI group had ischemic changes and 2 patients (5%) had nonspecific changes, whereas only 1 patient (4%) with a negative cTnI had nonspecific changes. Bivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant association for positive cTnI and mortality; however, on multivariate analysis this was no longer significant.

Conclusion

Forty-three percent of bacteremic patients had an elevated cTnI. Risk factors for elevated cTnI were severity of the underlying infection, renal function, and underlying cardiac disease. Increased cTnI was found to be a dependent risk factor and a surrogate marker for death.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^117ADpsc]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that although a considerable number of ICU patients have elevated troponin measurements, and elevated troponin measurements are specific for myocardial necrosis, troponin itself does not distinguish between ischemic and nonischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Interpretation of elevated troponin levels in the ICU must be considered in the context of the patient's symptoms (frequently limited in the ICU) or correlated with ECG findings or other imaging modalities. Most studies have examined elevated troponin levels in the critically ill in isolation, and it is unclear what proportion of patients have actually suffered an MI. One study evaluated troponin with ECGs in 34 consecutive critically ill patients who were mechanically ventilated and underwent thoracic or vascular surgery. It found that 11 patients (32%) had elevated troponin levels, and ECGs were available in 10 patients. Four patients (12%) had ST-segment elevation or depression, meeting criteria for MI; three patients had nonspecific changes and three had no ECG changes. Another study used continuous 12-lead telemetry monitoring in 76 patients admitted with noncardiac conditions. An elevated troponin level was found in 12 patients (15.8%), and six of these patients had transient ischemic events (mainly ST-segment depression) on telemetry.

The importance of a diagnosis that does not alter a patient's prognosis is questionable. Therefore, potentially the most important reason to identify critically ill patients with elevated troponin as having an MI or not having an MI is that the prognosis of these patients may be different. In the noncritically ill population, elevated troponin levels are an independent prognostic marker for short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In the ICU several studies have reported that elevated troponin levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Elevated troponin I is a predictor of mortality in medical-surgical ICU patients, including those without acute coronary syndromes, and in ICU patients with early sepsis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism and following cardiac surgery. In surgical ICU patients, troponin is a predictor of mortality and longer length of ICU and hospital stay. However, most studies have examined troponin alone and did not examine prognosis in relation to those patients who had associated ECG changes (i.e. patients with MI).

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin clinical decision pathways — preferred algorithms for emergency department rule-out: The ESC 0/1 (or 0/2) and High-STEACS approaches are recommended over simply using the 99th percentile URL value at 0 and 3 hours to rule out MI because direct comparisons demonstrate both greater efficacy (more patients ruled out) and greater safety (fewer missed MIs).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to troponin levels, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin as the preferred biomarker because it enables more rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

Rethinking Troponin: Are We Measuring the Right Thing?

If troponin is not an independent predictor of death in sepsis, what might explain its elevation? The findings of Choi et al suggest that renal dysfunction, rather than significant cardiac injury, may be the key player. Indeed, impaired renal clearance complicates troponin interpretation, raising critical questions: Is the utility of troponin tainted in the face of renal dysfunction? Sepsis is a master of collateral damage, and troponin elevation might reflect broader systemic dysfunction rather than large‐scale myocardial injury in all cases.

While sepsis may induce transient cardiac injury, its clinical relevance remains unclear and may be variable depending on severity. Similar to transient troponin elevations after endurance events, where myocardial strain leads to biomarker release without lasting dysfunction, sepsis may cause low‐grade troponin leaks due to systemic stress. Although troponin release is often presumed to represent myocardial injury and new‐onset cardiac dysfunction in sepsis evidence challenges this assumption. Vallabhajosyula et al examined 434 patients with sepsis and found that 48% had new‐onset left ventricular dysfunction; however, admission troponin‐T levels did not differ significantly between those with and without dysfunction (0.07 versus 0.06 ng/mL; P = 0.22). This suggests that troponin elevation in sepsis may not directly reflect structural myocardial impairment. If troponin is merely a bystander, present with varying levels of injury, some clinically significant and others not, its routine measurement warrants reconsideration, especially if other cost‐effective markers offer greater prognostic value.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) — ED troponin testing within 3 hours: Level C recommendations indicate that in adult patients with suspected acute NSTE ACS, conventional troponin testing at 0 and 3 hours among low-risk patients (HEART score 0 to 3) can predict an acceptable low rate of 30-day MACE; a single high-sensitivity troponin below the level of detection on ED arrival, or negative serial high-sensitivity troponin at 0 and 2 hours, is predictive of a low rate of MACE; and in low-risk patients based on validated accelerated diagnostic pathways that include a nonischemic ECG and negative serial high-sensitivity troponins at presentation and at 2 hours, testing can predict a low rate of 30-day MACE allowing for an accelerated discharge pathway from the ED. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified.

Unadjusted and Adjusted Predictors of Short‐ and Long‐Term Mortality

In comparison to patients without significant delta TnT, patients with elevated delta TnT (≥ 0.03 ng/mL) had higher unadjusted in‐hospital mortality (30.6% versus 23%; OR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.03–2.13]; P = 0.04), but no differences in 1‐year survival (P = 0.23 by log‐rank test; Figure 1 B). Unadjusted log 10 delta TnT was not associated with higher in‐hospital mortality (OR 1.3 [95% CI, 0.9–1.9]; P = 0.21), 1‐year mortality (OR 1.2 [95% CI, 0.9–1.7]; P = 0.39) or longer ICU (estimate 0.35, SE 0.48; P = 0.46) and hospital length of stay (estimate −1.38, SE 1.35; P = 0.31). There were no differences in in‐hospital (P = 0.06) and 1‐year (P = 0.77) mortality across delta TnT quartiles (Figure 5). Log 10 delta TnT was not an independent predictor of short‐ or long‐term mortality on multivariate analysis (Table 3).

To convert hs-cTnT to micrograms per liter, multiply by 0.
001. Exposure Dynamic change in SCr during the ED visits. Main Outcomes and Measures Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the log-linear regression of kinetic change in hs-cTnT. Logistic regression models were applied to calculate odds ratios for change in hs-cTnT indicating acute myocardial injury in association with change in SCr, and to assess the diagnostic performance of hs-cTnT for MI in patients with chest pain.

Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study of patients in the ED suggests that dynamic change in SCr among patients with AKI was associated with hs-cTnT concentrations indicative of acute myocardial injury. These observations were accompanied by poor performance of recommended hs-cTnT–based algorithms for MI risk stratification. The estimated change in hs-cTnT velocity in association with the change in SCr velocity in visits by patients with no MI is illustrated in eFigure 6A and B in Supplement 1. The estimated changes in hs-cTnT velocity were
3. 9% per hour for an SCr increase of 5% and 4. 6% per hour for an SCr decrease of 5%. In this cohort study, we found that elevated and dynamic hs-cTnT concentrations indicative of acute myocardial injury are common among patients with AKI in the ED and are associated with dynamic changes in SCr.

This finding was reflected by a low clinical accuracy of guideline-recommended hs-cTnT cutoff criteria for MI in patients presenting with chest pain to the ED with concurrent AKI.

### High-sensitivity vs conventional troponin HEART pathway… [^116TndNr]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In a multicenter cohort study of 17 384 ED patients with chest pain risk stratified with a HEART pathway incorporating conventional vs high-sensitivity troponin level, the high-sensitivity troponin group showed a higher rate of acute myocardial infarction diagnosis during the ED visit and a lower rate of AMI diagnosis within 30 days after the visit, along with lower rates of admission, stress testing, and revascularization. Mortality was rare and similar across groups. Meaning This study suggests that a high-sensitivity troponin HEART pathway may be associated with earlier detection of AMI and improved resource use. Importance Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain are routinely risk stratified for major adverse cardiac events using the HEART score pathway, which incorporates clinical features, risk factors, electrocardiography findings, and initial serum troponin testing.

A new HEART pathway incorporating high-sensitivity troponin level may improve risk stratification among patients with possible acute myocardial infarction. Objective To compare health outcomes and resource use among emergency department patients undergoing cardiac risk stratification with a HEART pathway using conventional vs high-sensitivity serum troponin. Design, Setting, and Participants This multicenter pre-post cohort study was conducted between January 1 and September 6, 2021, at 16 Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals during uptake of a high-sensitivity serum troponin assay and included 17 384 adult patients who presented to an emergency department with chest pain and were risk stratified with a HEART pathway based on conventional troponin or high-sensitivity troponin. In the emergency department, 228 of 4944 patients in the high-sensitivity troponin group received a diagnosis of AMI compared with 251 of 12 440 patients in the conventional troponin group. Among those who did not receive a diagnosis of AMI in the emergency department, an additional 60 patients in the high-sensitivity troponin group and 294 in the conventional troponin group received a diagnosis within 30 days. Kidney failure was more common in the hsTn group than in the cTn group.

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^112EuAQD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conflicting Evidence: What Are We Missing?

Multiple studies have demonstrated a correlation between elevated cardiac troponin levels and worse outcomes in sepsis. The findings by Choi et al contrast with those of Frencken et al, who conducted a large observational study measuring high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels daily in patients with sepsis and found that elevated troponin was independently associated with early, but not late, death. Similarly, Zheng et al conducted a meta‐analysis of > 20 000 patients with sepsis, demonstrating a significant association between elevated troponin and death. Choi et al excluded patients with prior cardiovascular disease and used propensity score matching, potentially accounting for confounding factors that may have influenced previous results but may limit generalizability.
