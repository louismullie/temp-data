## Question

Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, including definition, etiologies, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, prognosis, and management, with attention to how it differs from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and scope. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories and their clinical implications. Next, I will examine pathophysiologic mechanisms and reconcile inflammation-centric versus injury/repair models. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic algorithm and imaging features. Then, I should review prognosis and risk stratification. Finally, I will appraise current management, including antifibrotic therapy, supportive care, and research gaps, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these threads together.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis refers to fibrotic lung disease that follows a clearly identifiable inflammatory insult, distinguishing it from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which lacks a known cause and is defined by a UIP pattern and progressive fibrosis in older adults; importantly, postinfectious fibrotic ILD is a recognized subtype within non-IPF fibrotic ILDs, and some postinflammatory cases may evolve into progressive pulmonary fibrosis if they meet standardized criteria for symptomatic, physiologic, and radiologic progression over about a year [^116iGw4y] [^1137baS3] [^111U2VWe].

> I will now examine the major etiologic categories to anchor the scope. Postinfectious fibrosis is well described after severe viral pneumonias, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, with persistent interstitial changes in a substantial minority years later; post-TB fibrotic lung disease is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to chronic lung disease globally; and ARDS-related fibrosis is a classic noninfectious inflammatory precursor, with case-level evidence of postinflammatory fibrosis after ARDS and reports of lung transplantation in this context; less commonly, unilateral postinfectious or aspiration-related abnormalities may be considered low-likelihood ILA and excluded from bilateral ILA definitions unless high-risk features are present [^116KbzJ5] [^116jZBKt] [^114tznXj] [^114KUEM5] [^114ooEuz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I reconcile competing models. Historically, fibrosis was viewed as inflammation-driven, but in IPF the weight of evidence supports an epithelial injury and aberrant wound-healing paradigm with fibroblast foci and minimal inflammation; however, in postinflammatory fibrosis, inflammation is often prominent early and can persist, and emerging data show alveolar fibroblast lineages orchestrate sequential inflammatory and fibrotic programs, with TGF-β driving a transition from inflammatory to fibrotic fibroblast states; this reconciles why anti-inflammatory strategies may help early but antifibrotics are often needed once fibrosis is established [^116rfWsP] [^1171Uh2B] [^114vWzP9] [^111iF8SV].

> Wait, let me verify the key molecular drivers so I don't overstate any single pathway. TGF-β signaling is central across fibrotic contexts, with IL-13 and periostin contributing to matrix remodeling and collagen cross-linking; oxidative stress and NOX4 activity can amplify profibrotic signaling, and fibroblast paracrine signaling sustains a proinflammatory microenvironment; these nodes explain why pleiotropic antifibrotics like pirfenidone and nintedanib have modest but real effects and why combination strategies are being explored [^111eY27j] [^116nmzFx] [^116WQPMw] [^1112NFhQ].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and imaging features, and I need to ensure I align with guideline frameworks. High-resolution CT is the cornerstone: in established fibrosis, expect reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion; in postinfectious cohorts, band-like consolidations and persistent ground-glass opacities may represent structural injury rather than reversible inflammation; UIP features such as subpleural basal honeycombing support an IPF-like pattern when present, but absence of UIP does not exclude fibrosis; multidisciplinary discussion is essential to exclude alternative causes and to classify the fibrotic pattern and likely etiology [^112W1mW2] [^116KbzJ5] [^114nmeQV].

> I should double-check the functional profile and longitudinal assessment. Restrictive physiology with reduced FVC and DLCO is typical; in suspected progressive pulmonary fibrosis, I need to confirm that at least two of the following occur within a year without alternative explanation: worsening symptoms, physiologic decline (FVC ≥ 5% predicted or DLCO > 10% predicted), or radiologic progression (traction bronchiectasis, new reticulation, new or increased honeycombing, or lobar volume loss); importantly, the PPF definition is agnostic to underlying ILD subtype and reflects worse prognosis rather than a distinct diagnosis [^111U2VWe] [^112RRSJX].

> Let me consider prognosis and risk stratification carefully. Postinfectious fibrotic ILD appears to have a lower rate of progression to PPF compared with fibrotic HP or iNSIP, yet progression still confers substantially higher risks of respiratory failure and mortality; older age, severity of the initial inflammatory insult, and the presence of a UIP pattern portend worse outcomes; persistent radiographic abnormalities years after infection, including bands and ground-glass opacities, likely reflect true structural fibrosis rather than transient inflammation [^1137baS3] [^116jZBKt] [^116KbzJ5].

> Now, I need to appraise management, and I should confirm where evidence is strong versus conditional. For IPF, pirfenidone and nintedanib reduce functional decline; for non-IPF progressive fibrosing ILDs, nintedanib is conditionally recommended and pirfenidone is suggested with low-quality evidence, with INBUILD demonstrating benefit across multiple non-IPF ILDs; in postinfectious fibrosis, early immunomodulation may be reasonable if active inflammatory features persist, but once fibrosis is established, antifibrotic therapy is prioritized; supportive care, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation, and transplant referral for advanced disease remain foundational; I should also note that pre-transplant antifibrotic use did not increase post-transplant complications in IPF cohorts, supporting continuation when indicated [^113FB2YV] [^117Nv1VM] [^114KUEM5] [^116QU1KE].

> But wait, what about investigational and adjunctive strategies; I should be cautious. N-acetylcysteine may downregulate TGF-β signaling and enhance H₂S biology, though clinical benefit in established fibrosis remains uncertain; JNK inhibition (e.g. CC-90001) is in phase 2 trials targeting epithelial death and fibroblast activation; neutrophil-directed strategies are being explored in postviral fibrosis; and animal model guidance underscores testing antifibrotics after the inflammatory phase and using complementary models to improve translatability, which informs trial design for postinflammatory fibrosis as well [^116nmzFx] [^113dugo5] [^1148dKFf] [^1173pR7F] [^116gjaH3].

> I should confirm key knowledge gaps so we don't overstate certainty. The natural history of postinfectious fibrosis beyond one year remains incompletely defined, biomarkers to distinguish resolving organizing pneumonia from irreversible fibrosis are lacking, and optimal timing and sequencing of antifibrotic versus immunomodulatory therapy are unsettled; moreover, the extent to which host genetics (e.g. MUC5B) modifies post-COVID fibrosis risk is hypothesis-generating and requires larger, diverse cohorts [^116jZBKt] [^116KbzJ5].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis encompasses fibrotic lung disease arising after identifiable inflammatory insults such as severe viral pneumonia, tuberculosis, or ARDS; pathobiology spans early inflammatory injury with a transition to profibrotic repair programs driven by TGF-β and fibroblast lineage dynamics; diagnosis relies on HRCT patterns, pulmonary function trends, and multidisciplinary exclusion of alternative causes; prognosis varies by etiology and the emergence of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which carries adverse outcomes; management integrates supportive care with antifibrotic therapy for those with a progressive fibrotic phenotype, while recognizing that early inflammatory phases may still respond to immunomodulation and that ongoing research is needed to personalize timing and combinations of therapy [^1137baS3] [^114vWzP9] [^111U2VWe] [^117Nv1VM].

Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis is a **chronic, progressive scarring** of the lung that follows severe inflammatory injury, such as ARDS, severe viral pneumonia, or connective tissue disease [^113Sk9fu]. It is driven by **aberrant wound healing** with persistent fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix deposition, and architectural distortion, leading to restrictive physiology and respiratory failure [^116iGw4y] [^114vWzP9]. Diagnosis relies on **HRCT** showing reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, with pulmonary function tests demonstrating a restrictive defect and reduced DLCO [^112W1mW2]. Management includes antifibrotic therapy (nintedanib or pirfenidone) to slow progression, supportive care, and lung transplantation for advanced disease; prognosis is poor, with median survival of 2–5 years, underscoring the need for early detection and intervention [^113FB2YV] [^116iGw4y] [^117Nv1VM].

---

## Pathogenesis

Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis arises from **aberrant wound healing** after severe alveolar epithelial injury, with persistent fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix deposition, and architectural distortion [^1171Uh2B]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Epithelial injury**: Repeated alveolar epithelial injury triggers abnormal repair [^111vqvzh].

- **Fibroblast activation**: Activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts produce collagen and extracellular matrix, leading to fibrosis [^116iGw4y].

- **Cytokine signaling**: TGF-β, IL-13, and periostin drive fibrosis and matrix remodeling [^111eY27j].

- **Immune dysregulation**: Persistent immune activation sustains fibrosis [^111iF8SV].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Dyspnea**: Progressive exertional dyspnea is the most common symptom [^116KddEp].

- **Cough**: Chronic, dry cough is frequent [^notfound].

- **Fatigue and weight loss**: Common systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Physical examination**: Fine bibasilar crackles ("Velcro" crackles) are characteristic [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on clinical, radiological, and physiological findings:

| **Modality** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| High-resolution CT (HRCT) | - Reticulation <br/> - Traction bronchiectasis <br/> - Honeycombing <br/> - Ground-glass opacities (early) [^112W1mW2] |
| Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) | - Restrictive pattern <br/> - Reduced FVC <br/> - Reduced DLCO [^116KddEp] |
| Histopathology (if biopsy) | - Fibroblast foci <br/> - Collagen deposition <br/> - Architectural distortion [^1171Uh2B] |

---

## Management strategies

Management aims to **slow progression**, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life:

- **Antifibrotic therapy**: Nintedanib and pirfenidone slow FVC decline and disease progression [^111vqvzh] [^116QU1KE].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and vaccination are essential [^notfound].

- **Lung transplantation**: Considered for advanced disease and refractory cases [^115ydfef].

- **Experimental therapies**: JNK inhibitors and other agents are under investigation [^113dugo5].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **poor**, with median survival of 2–5 years. Progressive fibrosis, respiratory failure, and acute exacerbations are common; early diagnosis and antifibrotic therapy can improve outcomes [^116iGw4y] [^111vqvzh].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **novel antifibrotic agents**, biomarker discovery, and personalized medicine. Key areas include:

- **Novel antifibrotic agents**: JNK inhibitors and other targeted therapies [^113dugo5].

- **Biomarkers**: Identification of biomarkers for early detection and monitoring [^111vqvzh].

- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring therapy based on genetic and molecular profiles [^117Nv1VM].

Pulmonary fibrosis animal models — bleomycin timing for antifibrotic testing: The bleomycin model shows acute lung injury (Days 0–7), fibroproliferation (Days 3–14), and established fibrosis (generally Days 14–28). The consensus of the panel is that it is insufficient to only test an antifibrotic compound before evidence of histological fibrosis, and it is more meaningful to deliver the drug therapeutically after histological evidence of fibrosis, no sooner than Days 7–10 postinstillation after the peak of the acute inflammatory phase. When considering therapeutic dosing in other models (e.g., adenoviral–TGF-β), it remains important to ensure that therapies are only administered after the resolution of any inflammation.

6.4 Pathogenesis of chronic eczem: focusing on fibrosis and pigmentation

Tissue remodeling takes place along with the healing process of chronic eczema. This process is histologically represented by fibrosis. Periostin has been shown to influence tissue remodeling, fibrosis, regeneration, and repair. Periostin contributes to collagen fibrillogenesis, collagen cross‐linking, and the formation of extracellular matrix. In allergic reactions, periostin is involved in type 2 immunity and can be induced by IL‐4 and IL‐13. Type 2 cytokine–induced periostin acts on keratinocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines that further enhance the type 2 response, thereby sustaining and amplifying chronic allergic inflammation. A variety of different allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma and AD, are associated with periostin expression.

In addition to periostin, osteopontin plays multiple roles in the regulation of allergic responses, including regulation of IgE response, inflammatory cell migration, and the development of airway fibrosis and angiogenesis. Osteopontin has been increasingly recognized for its involvement in the progression of pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac fibrosis. Osteopontin is also involved in skin fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis, wound healing, and keloid.

IL‐13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. IL‐13 induces transforming growth factor β1 in macrophages through a two‐stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL‐13Rα2. It involves IL‐13 signaling through IL‐13Rα2 to activate an AP‐1 variant, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter.

Besides fibrosis, hyperpigmentation following inflammation is a common condition in dermatology. In general, there have been two proposed mechanisms underlying postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. One is increased melanogenesis in the epidermis (Figure 8a) and the other is deposition of melanin pigment in the dermis (Figure 8b).

FIGURE 8
Mechanisms of hyperpigmentation in chronic eczema. Two types of mechanism underlie postinflammatory pigmentation. (a) Instead of a physiological state, pathological stimuli, such as inflammation, induce the expression of melanogenesis‐related genes via reactive oxygen species (ROS). The synthesized melanin pigment is transferred from melanocytes to epidermal keratinocytes. (b) In the inflammatory condition, CD8 + T cells attack melanocytes as well as keratinocytes, and melanin is scattered in the upper dermis. Macrophages phagocytose melanin, forming melanophages. α‐MSH, α‐melanocyte–stimulating hormone; SCF, stem cell factor.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: an epithelial / fibroblastic cross-talk disorder [^116rfWsP]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and usually progressive lung disorder of unknown etiology. A growing body of evidence suggests that, in contrast to other interstitial lung diseases, IPF is a distinct entity in which inflammation is a secondary and non-relevant pathogenic partner. Evidence includes the presence of similar mild/moderate inflammation either in early or late disease, and the lack of response to potent anti-inflammatory therapy. Additionally, it is clear from experimental models and some human diseases that it is possible to have fibrosis without inflammation. An evolving hypothesis proposes that IPF may result from epithelial micro-injuries and abnormal wound healing.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: prevailing and evolving hypotheses about its pathogenesis and implications for therapy [^1171Uh2B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and usually fatal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, which result in irreversible distortion of the lung's architecture. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms remain to be determined, the prevailing hypothesis holds that fibrosis is preceded and provoked by a chronic inflammatory process that injures the lung and modulates lung fibrogenesis, leading to the end-stage fibrotic scar. However, there is little evidence that inflammation is prominent in early disease, and it is unclear whether inflammation is relevant to the development of the fibrotic process. Evidence suggests that inflammation does not play a pivotal role. Inflammation is not a prominent histopathologic finding, and epithelial injury in the absence of ongoing inflammation is sufficient to stimulate the development of fibrosis. In addition, the inflammatory response to a lung fibrogenic insult is not necessarily related to the fibrotic response. Clinical measurements of inflammation fail to correlate with stage or outcome, and potent anti-inflammatory therapy does not improve outcome. This review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis involves abnormal wound healing in response to multiple, microscopic sites of ongoing alveolar epithelial injury and activation associated with the formation of patchy fibroblast-myofibroblast foci, which evolve to fibrosis. Progress in understanding the fibrogenic mechanisms in the lung is likely to yield more effective therapies.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: multiple causes and multiple mechanisms? [^113xRaZi]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating condition that carries a prognosis worse than that of many cancers. A recent classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias has redefined the diagnostic criteria necessary to determine a diagnosis of IPF. The present authors believe that this redefinition is incorrect, relying as it does on subtle histological differences for the definition of separate disease categories. A further issue affecting IPF research is the polarisation of views around two competing pathogenetic hypotheses. One argues for the primacy of inflammation as the trigger that initiates fibrosis, and the other proposes that fibrosis arises as a consequence of chronic epithelial injury and failure of repair due to aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. The present authors believe that this schism is hampering understanding of IPF and skewing research priorities. It is argued here, instead, that abnormalities in multiple pathways involved in wound healing and inflammation lead to the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and it is suggested that a new rationale for clinical classification and pathogenesis may be more productive in driving the search for novel therapies in the future.

### Role of IPF genetic risk loci in post-COVID-19 lung abnormalities: a cohort study [^116KbzJ5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

We evaluated how IPF risk loci influence post-COVID-19 lung abnormalities at 3 months following severe disease, though it remains unclear if these SNPs influence persistence of abnormalities over longer periods of time, which has important implications for postinfectious lung fibrosis. In a long-term study following SARS-CoV, pulmonary interstitial changes largely improved over time, although some chronic ground glass opacity or band-like consolidation persisted in 38% of patients at 15 years following infection. A study of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV also showed persistent findings in 33% of patients following recovery, although follow-up time was notably shorter ranging from 32 to 230 days after hospital discharge. Although ground glass opacities are commonly thought to represent reversible inflammation, persistence of such findings and bands years after infection would presumably suggest these represent true structural damage and fibrosis. It is unclear what role IPF risk alleles may play in persistent lung abnormalities and ventilatory defects in the long term following COVID-19 or other viral pneumonias, and future studies are needed to better understand pathogenesis of postinfectious lung changes and identify those at greatest risk.

Our small sample size, reduced power, and hospitalised cohort represent important limitations. Patients who died in hospital were necessarily excluded from the cohort and introduced significant survivorship bias. We lacked data on genetic ancestry, and any effects of tested SNPs may be more evident in subgroups with higher frequencies of the risk alleles in question. While MUC5B was associated with reduced post-COVID-19 ground glass and this plausible finding is supported by a similar trend in PFTs and the broader literature, this should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating and requires confirmation in larger population-based studies. In addition, although individuals with pre-existing ILD were excluded, our patients did not undergo systematic pre-COVID-19 HRCT to confirm that observed lung findings were definitively due to COVID-19, which is relevant given SNPs like MUC5B have been associated with interstitial lung abnormalities.

### Modern concepts on the role of inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis [^114bAymW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a uniformly lethal disease with limited biomarkers and no proven therapeutic intervention short of lung transplantation. Pulmonary fibrosis at one time was thought to be a result of inflammation in the lung. Although some forms of pulmonary fibrosis may result from inflammation, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is currently thought to result from cell death primarily and inflammation secondarily.

Objective

To determine the role of inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis in light of our laboratory's published and unpublished research and published literature.

Data Sources

Review based on our laboratory's published and unpublished experimental data with relevant background and clinical context provided.

Conclusions

Although cell death is central to pulmonary fibrosis, the proper cytokine environment leading to macrophage polarization is also critical. Evaluation of this environment is promising both for the development of disease biomarkers and for targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Mechanisms of lung fibrosis resolution [^112xNxGd]. The American Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Fibrogenesis involves a dynamic interplay between factors that promote the biosynthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix along with pathways that degrade the extracellular matrix and eliminate the primary effector cells. Opposing the often held perception that fibrotic tissue is permanent, animal studies and clinical data now demonstrate the highly plastic nature of organ fibrosis that can, under certain circumstances, regress. This review describes the current understanding of the mechanisms whereby the lung is known to resolve fibrosis focusing on degradation of the extracellular matrix, removal of myofibroblasts, and the role of inflammatory cells. Although there are significant gaps in understanding lung fibrosis resolution, accelerated improvements in biotechnology and bioinformatics are expected to improve the understanding of these mechanisms and have high potential to lead to novel and effective restorative therapies in the treatment not only of pulmonary fibrosis, but also of a wide-ranging spectrum of chronic disorders.

### A nutraceutical strategy for downregulating TGF β signalling: prospects for prevention of fibrotic disorders, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis [^116nmzFx]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Tissue cysteine levels can be rate-limiting for H₂S synthesis, and those levels tend to decline in the elderly. Supplemental N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can also boost tissue levels of the key antioxidant glutathione, which can participate in mechanisms that reverse the pro-inflammatory effects of hydrogen peroxide on signalling pathways. Hence, NAC supplementation has been recommended for the elderly, and might be expected to at least modestly aid control of fibrotic syndromes in this group, both by opposing the pro-fibrotic impact of Nox4-derived hydrogen peroxide, and by enhancing H₂S synthesis. Consistent with this speculation, oral administration of NAC has shown favourable effects in multiple rodent models of pathogenic fibrosis. Moreover, NAC also has been shown to downregulate TGFβ signalling in cell cultures.

### Time for a change: is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis still idiopathic and only fibrotic? [^112jGQLv]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible, and typically fatal lung disease characterised by subpleural fibrosis, subepithelial fibroblast foci, and microscopic honeycombing. Although understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms continues to evolve, evidence indicates that distal airway and alveolar epithelial cells are central drivers of the disease. In this Viewpoint, we review the history of naming and classifications used to define the disease now referred to as IPF, in the context of understanding the clinical presentation, causes, and pathogenesis of the disease. We aim to generate discussion on whether, given the substantial progress made in understanding the clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of IPF, a change of name should be considered. To initiate this discussion, we offer new suggestions to update the name of this disease and new approaches to classify all forms of pulmonary fibrosis.

### Interstitial lung disease following coronavirus disease 2019 [^116jZBKt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to summarize the recent data concerning interstitial lung disease after COVID-19, a field where knowledge is evolving very quickly.

Recent Findings

It has been found that a proportion of patients displayed fibrotic-like pattern on chest computed tomography shortly after COVID-19 pneumonia. Those lesions can potentially represent precursors of fibrosis, although most of them will resolve until 1 year postinfection. There was a wide range of the prevalence of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease detected in the literature, which can be attributed to the heterogeneous definition of lung abnormalities and the discrepancy of study design. The severity of acute COVID-19 disease has been linked to increased risk of residual imaging and functional abnormalities, while reduced DLco was the most common functional abnormality in long-term survivors. Studies indicated that pathophysiology of post-COVID interstitial lung disease shares common mechanisms with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Regarding therapeutic strategies of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease, the role of immunosuppressive and antifibrotic treatment is currently under investigation.

Summary

We still need to learn about the natural history of COVID-19 disease, allowing for a better targeting of therapeutic interventions through a multidisciplinary approach.

### Evaluation of progressive pulmonary fibrosis in non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-interstitial lung diseases: a cross-sectional study [^1137baS3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Progressive pulmonary fibrosis is the symptomatic, physiological, and radiological progression of interstitial lung diseases. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between progressive pulmonary fibrosis and demographic characteristics and to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes and mortality.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 221 patients diagnosed with non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung diseases who were followed in the last 5 years. Patient symptoms, clinical, radiological, and demographic data were examined. Risk factors for the development of progressive pulmonary fibrosis and the relationship with clinical outcomes and mortality were examined.

Results

Of the patients, 33.0% (n = 73) had fibrotic idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP), 35.7% (n = 79) had fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP), 18.1% (n = 40) had fibrotic connective tissue disease (CTD) interstitial lung diseases (ILD), and 13.1% (n = 29) had postinfectious fibrotic ILD. The progressive pulmonary fibrosis development rates of the subtypes were 46.5% iNSIP (n = 34), 86.0% fibrotic HP (n = 68), 42.5% fibrotic CTD-ILD (n = 17), and 20.7% postinfectious ILD (n = 6). The presence of progressive pulmonary fibrosis was associated with the development of respiratory failure and mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.04–7.05 and OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.23–3.69). Progressive pulmonary fibrosis development was higher in hypersensitivity pneumonia patients with farmer's lung (OR: 5.06, 95% CI: 1.02–25.18).

Conclusion

Progressive pulmonary fibrosis was more prevalent in older patients. Farming was an important risk factor in the development of hypersensitivity pneumonia-progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Respiratory failure and mortality were higher in those who developed progressive pulmonary fibrosis.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^114ooEuz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The committee discussed whether inclusion of high-risk populations in the definition of ILA should prompt reconsideration of the previous requirement for findings to be bilateral, with bilaterality retained in the definition of ILA for two main reasons. First, the need for abnormalities to be bilateral has been used in previous definitions, and maintaining consistency was desirable in the absence of compelling data to justify the change. Second, it was considered a priority to exclude patients at low risk with unilateral abnormalities that frequently stem from entities unlikely to represent progressive disease, such as postinfectious or aspiration-related abnormalities. Although the definition of ILA states that findings should be bilateral, there are some high-risk populations in which unilateral findings may have clinical relevance. Patients with a strong family history or known genetic variants who have unilateral findings may be at risk of future progression to ILD, even though there may be a long interval between the initial identification of these abnormalities and the future diagnosis of ILD. Patients with CTD and/or occupational exposures may also present with unilateral abnormalities, but data on the risk of progression in such cases is limited, and findings often represent non-ILA etiologies (Table 2).

The Fleischner Society Position Paper identified three main subcategories of ILAs, including nonsubpleural ILAs (i.e. without predominant subpleural localization), subpleural nonfibrotic ILAs (i.e. with predominant subpleural localization and without evidence of fibrosis), and subpleural fibrotic ILAs (i.e. with predominant subpleural localization and with evidence of pulmonary fibrosis). Fibrosis was defined by the presence of architectural distortion with traction bronchiectasis and/or honeycombing and applies to those ILAs that do not meet the extent or pattern criteria for ILD (see Figures E2C and E2D). The committee considered whether it is appropriate to more simply stratify ILAs only by the presence or absence of fibrosis, similar to the approach taken in major ILD patterns and diagnoses that are categorized as fibrotic and nonfibrotic (e.g. nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP] pattern, hypersensitivity pneumonitis [HP]); however, it was acknowledged that there is prognostic significance for each of the three previous categories, which the committee therefore chose to retain.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116iGw4y]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis:

- **Definition**: IPF is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of idiopathic origin, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia.
- **Pathophysiology**: IPF is a disease of unknown cause. Cigarette smoking, older age, male sex, air pollution, occupational exposures, viral infection, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, and genetic polymorphisms are potential risk factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of IPF is estimated at 5.8 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US.
- **Disease course**: In patients with IPF, secretion of profibrotic mediators lead to matrix deposition by myofibroblasts, with a progressive decline in pulmonary function, respiratory failure, and eventual death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for IPF is poor, with a median survival of 3.8 years in adults ≥ 65 years of age in the US.

### Evaluation of progressive pulmonary fibrosis in non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-interstitial lung diseases: a cross-sectional study [^115jtb8e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 123 (55.7%) of the total cohort of 221 patients over the age of 65 years, and 85 (38.5%) were female. The mean age was 65.78 years, and the rate of those currently smoking was 43% (n = 95). Fibrotic iNSIP was present in 73 (33.0%) patients, fibrotic HP in 79 (35.7%), fibrotic CTD-ILD in 40 (18.1%), and postinfectious fibrotic ILD in 29 (13.1%) patients. Surgical biopsy was performed in 40 of 221 patients in this study (18%). During follow-up, respiratory failure developed in 95 (43.0%) patients and mortality occurred in 99 (44.8%) patients. Of the total number of patients, 125 (56.6%) were classified as PPF. The number of patients meeting the definition of PPF in the study population was 34 (46.5%) in iNSIP, 68 (86.0%) in fibrotic HP, 17 (42.5%) in fibrotic CTD-ILD, and six (20.7%) in post-infectious ILD. The age of patients who developed PPF was significantly higher than younger patients (p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients categorised as PPF had shorter survival times (Fig. 1). Demographic data and comparisons of non-PPF and PPF cases are presented in Table 1. When all cases were evaluated (Table 2), patients with age over 65 years had a significantly increased risk of PPF (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.37–4.08). Patients with PPF were more susceptible to respiratory failure (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.01–3.00) and mortality was associated with PPF (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.23–3.69). Although being older and smoking appeared to be protective in terms of PPF in postinfectious ILD, there was no statistical significance. In the other three ILD subgroups, patients older than 65 years were at higher risk of PPF. There was no difference between males and females in terms of PPF. Smoking was associated with the development of PPF in iNSIP (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.11–7.47) and CTD-ILD (OR: 4.04, 95% CI: 1.05–15.47). The presence of PPF was not associated with the number of hospitalizations or exacerbations per year. Patient characteristics of subtypes with PPF are detailed in Table 3. Of the total HP cases (Table 4), 21.5% (n = 17) had bird fancier's lung and 49.3% (n = 39) had farmer's lung. Engaging in a farming-related job increased the risk of PPF (OR: 5.06, 95% CI: 1.02–25.18). No relationship was found between medication and PPF development; the medication rates of the patients and their PPF development status are shown in Table 5.

### Overview of pulmonary fibrosis [^111Piiq5]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a component of over 200 interstitial lung diseases. Some have known etiologies, however, for many diseases, the etiology remains unknown or obscure. This brief review examines the prevalence and classification of these diseases, the approach to be taken for the investigation of a patient suspected of having pulmonary fibrosis, the indications for the performance of lung biopsy, and current thoughts concerning the pathogenesis of the idiopathic forms of fibrotic lung disease. A brief review of established and emerging therapeutic strategies is included.

### A long and winding road: drug development in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1112NFhQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

IPF results from an aberrant wound-healing response after recurrent alveolar epithelial microinjury in genetically susceptible individuals. An intricate network of profibrotic pathways, with feedforward activation, is believed to be involved in disease pathogenesis. At the same time, pathways that play a role in resolution of fibrosis are downregulated. The process of fibrosis is biologically complex and involves multiple simultaneously activated pathways with considerable inbuilt redundancy. As such, a disease such as IPF is unlikely to be effectively targeted by any single compound alone unless that drug is highly pleiotropic in its mechanism of action. Such pleiotropism likely accounts for the (limited yet clinically relevant) efficacy of pirfenidone and nintedanib. Alternative approaches to identifying pleiotropic molecules are to combine therapies, which target specific complementary pathways, or to better identify individuals in whom the specific pathway is active in driving disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: use of animal models for the preclinical assessment of potential therapies for pulmonary fibrosis [^112mNGqa]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary fibrosis animal models — bleomycin route of delivery and model selection: For a single administration of bleomycin, the oropharyngeal route leads to pulmonary fibrosis persisting for up to 6 months while also shortening sedation time, avoiding a surgical procedure and associated postsurgical analgesia, and allowing more rapid post-procedure recovery than intratracheal delivery; the fibrotic response appears similar between these methods, although direct comparisons have not been formally assessed. The panel recommends use of a single oropharyngeal administration of bleomycin and that a second model be considered for preclinical testing; two different models may provide more robust data, with reasonable choices including adenoviral-driven TGF-β overexpression, FITC, asbestos, silica, or locally delivered thoracic radiation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require at least two species for toxicology, but not efficacy studies.

### Successful lung transplantation with graft recovered after thoracoabdominal normothermic perfusion from donor after circulatory death [^114KUEM5]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Lung transplantation with lungs procured from donors after circulatory death (DCD) has been established as an alternative technique to traditional donation after brain death (DBD) with comparable outcomes. Recently, in situ thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion (TA-NRP) has emerged as a novel technique employed in the procurement of cardiac allografts after circulatory death. TA-NRP, in contrast to ex situ machine perfusion, has the advantage of allowing in situ assessment of donor organs prior to final acceptance. However, there are some concerns that this technique may adversely impact the quality of lung allografts. Here, we present a case of a successful bilateral sequential lung transplantation in a patient with postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with lungs procured after normothermic in situ lung perfusion. Apart from the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys were also successfully transplanted from this donor.

### Therapeutic intervention: assessing the role of the international consensus guidelines [^113fhaZh]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The consensus statement released by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has provided guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with IPF. These guidelines suggest the use of conventional treatment options including therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The guidelines statement acknowledged the fact that there is little good-quality evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such therapies in patients with IPF. The statement was published in 2000 and was based on an extensive review of the literature up to and including December 1998. The goal of this review is to reexamine the treatment recommendations of the guidelines statement in the context of data that has since become available.

Stroma

Fibrotic scarring follows severe respiratory infections

Fibroblasts reside in the lung interstitium at low frequency. In response to injury, fibroblasts are activated, leading to an increase in their numbers. Fibroblast activation, which is thought to promote tissue repair, is typically driven by signals from adjacent injured alveolar epithelial cells. Recent studies in mice have shown that during acute respiratory infection, subsets of fibroblasts adopt interferon-responsive, proinflammatory or pro-repair phenotypes. Similarly, fibroblast-derived ECM proteases remodel the lung microenvironment following infection. While this new role for fibroblasts during acute infection is emerging, considerably more is known about their role during wound repair.

Pulmonary fibrosis can develop following severe or persistent damage to the lung induced by respiratory infections, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. Studies of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, both immediately following infection and 15 years later, noted impaired lung function and radiographic findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. A similar scenario is unfolding in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic, with pulmonary fibrosis a common feature of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19, also termed "long COVID". Post-mortem examinations of post-COVID19 lungs have revealed hallmark abnormalities such as alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction, fibroblastic foci, alterations in the extracellular matrix, and immune cell infiltration. While these studies demonstrate the association between pulmonary fibrosis and prior severe respiratory infections, the molecular mechanisms linking these two events has not been established, highlighting the need for further mechanistic studies.

### Pathogenesis of post-tuberculosis lung disease: defining knowledge gaps and research priorities at the second international post-tuberculosis symposium [^114tznXj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-tuberculosis (post-TB) lung disease is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the global burden of chronic lung disease, with recent estimates indicating that over half of TB survivors have impaired lung function after successful completion of TB treatment. However, the pathologic mechanisms that contribute to post-TB lung disease are not well understood, thus limiting the development of therapeutic interventions to improve long-term outcomes after TB. This report summarizes the work of the Pathogenesis and Risk Factors Committee for the Second International Post-Tuberculosis Symposium, which took place in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in April 2023. The committee first identified six areas with high translational potential: 1) tissue matrix destruction, including the role of matrix metalloproteinase dysregulation and neutrophil activity; 2) fibroblasts and profibrotic activity; 3) granuloma fate and cell death pathways; 4) mycobacterial factors, including pathogen burden; 5) animal models; and 6) the impact of key clinical risk factors, including HIV, diabetes, smoking, malnutrition, and alcohol. We share the key findings from a literature review of those areas, highlighting knowledge gaps and areas where further research is needed.

### Eicosanoid lipid mediators in fibrotic lung diseases: ready for prime time? [^111L6Jdw]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Recognition of a pivotal role for eicosanoids in both normal and pathologic fibroproliferation is long overdue. These lipid mediators have the ability to regulate all cell types and nearly all pathways relevant to fibrotic lung disorders. Abnormal fibroproliferation is characterized by an excess of profibrotic leukotrienes and a deficiency of antifibrotic prostaglandins. The relevance of an eicosanoid imbalance is pertinent to diseases involving the parenchymal, airway, and vascular compartments of the lung, and is supported by studies conducted both in humans and animal models. Given the lack of effective alternatives, and the existing and emerging options for therapeutic targeting of eicosanoids, such treatments are ready for prime time.

### Severe progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis post-COVID-19 infection [^112Av2Xn]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with a week-long history of shortness of breath. She had a background of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) which was stable and had not required any antifibrotic treatment. A month prior to this presentation, she was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia, with maximal oxygen requirement of 2L, but was discharged without need for supplemental oxygen. On readmission, she was found to have severe, rapidly progressive pulmonary fibrosis. After all precipitating causes were ruled out, it was felt her recent COVID-19 infection was the exacerbating factor causing progression of pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 infection has been hypothesised to cause long term pulmonary fibrosis, but this is the first case highlighting COVID-19 infection as the causative agent exacerbating IPF.

### Progressive pulmonary fibrosis: should the timelines Be taken out of the definition? [^112owXuB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The new ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT (American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Asociacion Latinoamericana del Torax) guideline on pulmonary fibrosis includes an important section proposing a definition and criteria for the diagnosis of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Multiple definitions of disease progression have been used in clinical studies assessing the efficacy and tolerability of antifibrotic therapy in PPF despite management (also known as interstitial lung disease with a progressive fibrotic phenotype). The guideline authors propose the term PPF (first proposed in a review article) and defining criteria that, if widely adopted, will help to standardize research in the field.

As noted by the authors, satisfying one or more of the proposed criteria (especially decline in pulmonary function tests over 6–12 mo) has been associated with an adverse prognosis, with less evidence that they also identify patients best suited for antifibrotic therapy. A key element of this definition is that changes in respiratory symptoms, physiology, and/or radiologic features should be assessed over the preceding year. However, the benefit:risk assessment guiding management decisions often depends on the kinetics of disease progression. Progression recognized as occurring over 6 months is often considered more worrisome than progression occurring over 2 years. In specifying that progression should occur over a 1-year period, the authors may have intended to discourage clinicians from waiting for 2 years to assess progression, as the enrolment criteria in the INBUILD trial (progression over 6 mo to 2 y) have occasionally been misunderstood to require.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: use of animal models for the preclinical assessment of potential therapies for pulmonary fibrosis [^116gjaH3]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — preclinical assessment of antifibrotic compounds for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — states that the consensus view is that use of the murine intratracheal bleomycin model in animals of both genders, using hydroxyproline measurements for collagen accumulation along with histologic assessments, is the best-characterized animal model available for preclinical testing. Testing of antifibrotic compounds in this model is recommended to occur after the acute inflammatory phase has subsided (generally after Day 7). Robust analyses may also include confirmatory studies in human IPF specimens and validation of results in a second system using in vivo or in vitro approaches. The panel also strongly encourages the publication of negative results to inform the lung fibrosis community. These recommendations are for preclinical therapeutic evaluation only and are not intended to dissuade development of emerging technologies to better understand IPF pathogenesis. For scope, the panel considered three major themes (choice of animal, practical considerations of fibrosis modeling, and fibrotic endpoints for evaluation).

### Progression of fibrosing interstitial lung disease [^1147z1Dh]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Many questions remain to be answered in future studies of PF-ILD: Which antifibrotic and immunosuppressive therapies can be combined safely? What is the incremental benefit of these medications when added to an established background therapy? Should antifibrotics and immunosuppressants be combined upfront or sequentially only in the context of ongoing disease progression? How should response to these treatments be assessed? And how should the additional therapeutic burden be managed, particularly, in polymorbid and frail patients? Additional clinical trials are forthcoming that will provide further insight into these questions, as well as anticipated post-hoc analyses from recently published studies.

### Diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: implications for respiratory care [^116KddEp]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Although poorly understood, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common of the idiopathic interstitial lung diseases. Its etiology is unknown, but how this fibrotic process develops in the lung has been studied over the last 60 years. It is a relatively rare disease, afflicting those 50–70 years of age, slightly more common among men than women, without racial predilection. The most common complaint is progressive shortness of breath. Pulmonary function testing reveals a restrictive ventilatory defect with a diminished diffusion capacity. The lungs demonstrate fibrotic and cystic areas interspersed with normal lung on radiographic and pathologic examination. No definitive medical treatment is available, although most patients are given trials of corticosteroids, alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. On average, patients survive 2–4 years after diagnosis. Lung transplantation has been the only therapy shown to improve survival of those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### The importance of balanced pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in diffuse lung disease [^1146ML7U]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

The lung responds to a variety of insults in a remarkably consistent fashion but with inconsistent outcomes that vary from complete resolution and return to normal to the destruction of normal architecture and progressive fibrosis. Increasing evidence indicates that diffuse lung disease results from an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, with a persistent imbalance that favors pro-inflammatory mediators dictating the development of chronic diffuse lung disease. This review focuses on the mediators that influence this imbalance.

### Challenges in pulmonary fibrosis: 7 – novel therapies and lung transplantation [^115ydfef]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The spectrum of diseases collectively known as pulmonary fibrosis does not have reliable therapeutic options. Many treatment protocols have been the subject of clinical trials, resulting in few significant improvements in outcome. Recently, cellular mechanisms have been the focus of investigations in progenitor cell studies, suggesting an immunomodulatory role for mesenchymal stem cells. The possible role of fibrogenic cytokines and the use of antagonist molecules are promising for future therapies. A range of anti-inflammatory treatments, including macrolide antibiotics, may also hold promise. When medical therapy has been unsuccessful in altering the course of the disease, lung transplantation may offer a significant survival advantage. Improvement in pre-transplant assessment and postoperative care, combined with more effective immunosuppressive regimes, has seen survival rates of 40% after 5 years. New options for therapy will lead to improved survival in coming years.

Research needs and future directions in PPF note that the existing randomized trial included 663 patients with PPF, but numbers within ILD subtypes were small, ranging from only 12 to 173, suggesting potential differential effects and the need for additional trials to identify patient populations most likely to benefit. Additional needs include determining why a subset of ILD patients develops a progressive irreversible fibrotic phenotype despite initial treatment; validating serum biomarkers and omics approaches; validating convolutional neural networks for imaging-based tasks including detection and prognostication; and prioritizing research on timing and sequence of antifibrotic therapy in relation to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.

### Fibroblast paracrine TNF-α signaling elevates integrin A5 expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [^116WQPMw]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, and limited to the lungs. It is characterized by progressive worsening of lung function, and is associated with a poor prognosis.

Although IPF is, by definition, a disease of unknown etiology, a number of potential mechanisms have been suggested over the years. Most patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), the pathologic hallmark of IPF, will manifest a mild to moderate degree of chronic cellular inflammation. Therefore, the inflammation hypothesis has dominated the field of pulmonary fibrosis for decades, and IPF continues to be viewed by many authorities as a chronic inflammatory disease of the lung parenchyma. Like in other fibrotic diseases, IPF lungs have a persistent inflammatory stimulus that sustains and/or stimulates production of growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines, which together stimulate the deposition of connective-tissue elements that progressively remodel and destroy normal tissue architecture. However, while an unremitting immune response can lead to fibrosis, immune-suppressive therapy affords limited benefits. Therefore, the hypothesis has been put forward that active cellular lung inflammation is not a major feature or a requirement for the development of IPF. Instead, the wide spectrum of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors found in the IPF lung is considered to be a result of deregulated wound healing processes.

It is widely accepted that the microenvironment plays a significant role in disease progression. Studies showed that fibrotic fibroblasts manifest pathological control of pathways governing cell proliferation, viability, motility, contractile function and connective tissue production. The increased deposition of matrix proteins seen in IPF may result from chronic stimulation of fibroblasts by lung effector cell derived cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Alternatively, similar signals may act on the existing heterogenous fibroblast population to mediate the emergence, whether by selection or induction, of sub populations of cells resulting in the predominance of the fibrotic phenotype in the lung, a phenotype that appears to remain in vitro.

Thus, on the one hand there is a wide consensus that inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in IPF progression, and on the other it is believed that the fibroblast itself is the primary effector in this disease progression. This can be settled by the fact that the fibroblasts themselves secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that further propagates IPF progression by affecting normal neighboring fibroblast cells. To test this hypothesis, we explored the effects of IPF derived soluble factors on normal fibroblast cell characteristics.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to prognosis, ALAT/ATS/ERS/JRS 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that IPF is a fatal lung disease and the natural history is variable and unpredictable:

- most patients with IPF demonstrate a gradual worsening of lung function over years and a minority of patients remains stable or declines rapidly

- some patients may experience episodes of acute respiratory worsening despite previous stability.

### Syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT research statement [^112xXdbf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) — conclusions state that CPFE is characterized by a wide variety of appearances and patterns on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and, when available, on histopathology; clustering of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, frequent associated comorbidities and complications (especially pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer), relevance for disease progression monitoring, and shared pathogenetic pathways suggest that CPFE should be considered a syndrome; despite numerous case series and studies, many important questions remain unanswered, and this ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Research Statement offers research definition and classification criteria and identifies major research priorities to better delineate the entity, understand its pathogenesis, and guide its management.

### Fibroblasts: the missing link between fibrotic lung diseases of different etiologies? [^114MisAk]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Fibrotic lung disorders, either idiopathic, or associated with a specific etiology or a specific condition such as scleroderma, are increasingly recognized. As a whole they constitute a group of diseases characterized by the progressive destruction of the lung which ultimately leads to chronic respiratory failure and death. Improving the prognosis of these disorders requires the identification of drugs capable of inhibiting partially or totally the progression of lung fibrosis, and perhaps of reversing established fibrosis. This has been the focus of huge efforts from academic groups and pharma companies, and more than 20 different molecules are being investigated in clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a well defined and relatively frequent fibrotic lung disease of unknown etiology. However, until now, only one drug has been approved for lung fibrosis treatment. This drug, pirfenidone, has been shown to slow the decline of lung function in IPF, but no drug has demonstrated effects on survival in patients with lung fibrosis. The effort must be prolonged and intensified.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: is it a familial disease? [^111wLubi]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressively fatal interstitial lung disease associated with pathological findings of usual interstitial pneumonia. Its pathogenesis is unknown, and there are no proven effective therapies. Familial cases account for 0.5–2% of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance. The clinical characteristics of familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are indistinguishable from sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These marked similarities support the hypothesis there may, in part, be a genetic basis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Recent Findings

Many investigations have evaluated genetic polymorphisms and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Candidate genes include cytokines and surfactant protein genes. To date, no gene has been consistently identified to be associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recent studies in familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have demonstrated a strong association with surfactant protein C gene mutations in one large kindred.

Summary

The pathogenesis of both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. A consistent genetic basis has not yet been demonstrated in all cases. Other factors, including variable gene expression, co-carriage of other modifying genes and environmental stimuli, particularly cigarette smoke, significantly contribute to disease expression.

### Inflammation and immunity in IPF pathogenesis and treatment [^111iF8SV]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, and ultimately fatal, chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. Repetitive alveolar epithelial injury triggers the early development of fibrosis. These injuries, in combination with dysregulated wound repair and fibroblast dysfunction, lead to ongoing tissue remodelling and fibrosis seen in end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Although the exact etiology in IPF is unknown and probably diverse, all stages of fibrosis are accompanied by innate and adaptive immune responses. The role of inflammation as an important component in IPF etiology is controversial and sometimes seen as an epiphenomenon of fibrosis. This view is partly the result of negative multicenter trials of anti-inflammatory drugs for IPF treatment. However, new insights on the role of macrophages, the loss of T-cell and B-cell tolerance leading auto-immune responses in IPF, and the interaction of immune cells with (myo)fibroblasts have led to a slow change of this opinion. Clearly, more insight is needed to integrate basic immune mechanisms into translational research and finally new IPF therapies. In this concise review, we will focus on the role of our innate and adaptive immune system in the initiation and perpetuation of IPF pathobiology. Next, we will discuss how immune responses are influenced by current anti-fibrotic treatments, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib and end with an overview of recent and upcoming therapeutic trials that target and modulate our immune system in patients with IPF.

### Alveolar fibroblast lineage orchestrates lung inflammation and fibrosis [^114vWzP9]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fibroblasts are present throughout the body and function to maintain tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have identified diverse fibroblast subsets in healthy and injured tissues 1,2, but the origins and functional roles of injury-induced fibroblast lineages remain unclear. Here we show that lung-specialized alveolar fibroblasts take on multiple molecular states with distinct roles in facilitating responses to fibrotic lung injury. We generate a genetic tool that uniquely targets alveolar fibroblasts to demonstrate their role in providing niches for alveolar stem cells in homeostasis and show that loss of this niche leads to exaggerated responses to acute lung injury. Lineage tracing identifies alveolar fibroblasts as the dominant origin for multiple emergent fibroblast subsets sequentially driven by inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signals after injury. We identify similar, but not completely identical, fibroblast lineages in human pulmonary fibrosis. TGFβ negatively regulates an inflammatory fibroblast subset that emerges early after injury and stimulates the differentiation into fibrotic fibroblasts to elicit intra-alveolar fibrosis. Blocking the induction of fibrotic fibroblasts in the alveolar fibroblast lineage abrogates fibrosis but exacerbates lung inflammation. These results demonstrate the multifaceted roles of the alveolar fibroblast lineage in maintaining normal alveolar homeostasis and orchestrating sequential responses to lung injury.

### Growth factors in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: relative roles [^1144A4PC]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients has evolved very slowly; the fundamental approach of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has had little impact on long-term survival. The continued use of corticosteroids is justified because of the lack of a more effective alternative. Current research indicates that the mechanisms driving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis reflect abnormal, dysregulated wound healing within the lung, involving increased activity and possibly exaggerated responses by a spectrum of profibrogenic growth factors. An understanding of the roles of these growth factors, and the way in which they modulate events at cellular level, could lead to more targeted therapeutic strategies, improving patients' quality of life and survival.

### Current and future therapeutic approaches in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1145NA9k]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal form of idiopathic diffuse lung disorders for which no current treatment is effective. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the current status and novel therapies of IPF, with emphasis on controlled trials. The studies selected included randomised controlled trials using drugs alone and/or in combination for the treatment of adults with IPF and meta-analyses, published in English. Abstracts of identified articles were retrieved and articles possibly fulfilling inclusion criteria were retrieved in full. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality if there were any included studies. Data quality was based on place of publication and relevance to clinical care. There is a lack of good-quality studies regarding the effectiveness of the most used drugs, including corticosteroids and noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agents. Oral corticosteroids are the usual treatment. Other therapies either alone or in combination with corticosteroids are widely used, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and colchicine. Interestingly, clinical trials with novel drugs, mainly antifibrotic, anticytokine and immunoregulatory, are currently being investigated in various trial phases. In conclusion, at present, there are no evidence-based therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further controlled studies are warranted to improve the evidence base for clinical practice.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^111U2VWe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Part II — definition of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF states that in a patient with ILD of known or unknown etiology other than IPF who has radiological evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, PPF is defined as at least two of the following three criteria occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation: 1) worsening respiratory symptoms; 2) physiological evidence of disease progression; and 3) radiological evidence of disease progression. The guideline stresses that it is critical to exclude alternative explanations for worsening, particularly when symptoms worsen and/or Dlco declines given lower specificity compared with FVC and chest CT. The committee further emphasized that PPF is defined separately from IPF, that PPF is not a diagnosis and is agnostic to underlying condition, and that the criteria reflect multiple clinical trials because no single trial should guide antifibrotic therapy.

### Update on pulmonary fibrosis: not all fibrosis is created equally [^114SnhKW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Three distinct patterns of pulmonary fibrosis, including usual interstitial pneumonia, fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and airway-centered fibrosis, can be identified on surgical lung biopsies.

Objectives

To compare the pathologic definitions, clinical and radiographic presentations, etiologies and differential diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses of usual interstitial pneumonia, fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and airway-centered fibrosis patterns, and to address the challenges and controversies related to pulmonary fibrosis.

Data Sources

Data were derived from published literature and clinical experience.

Conclusions

Although there may be overlap, identification of the dominant form of fibrosis in a particular case can provide a general category of disease and assist in identifying an etiology.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111vqvzh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by progressive lung scarring and the histological picture of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). It is associated with increasing cough and dyspnoea and impaired quality of life. IPF affects ∼3 million people worldwide, with incidence increasing dramatically with age. The diagnostic approach includes the exclusion of other interstitial lung diseases or overlapping conditions and depends on the identification of the UIP pattern, usually with high-resolution CT; lung biopsy might be required in some patients. The UIP pattern is predominantly bilateral, peripheral and with a basal distribution of reticular changes associated with traction bronchiectasis and clusters of subpleural cystic airspaces. The biological processes underlying IPF are thought to reflect an aberrant reparative response to repetitive alveolar epithelial injury in a genetically susceptible ageing individual, although many questions remain on how to define susceptibility. Substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the clinical management of IPF, with the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that decrease physiological progression and likely improve progression-free survival. Current efforts are directed at identifying IPF early, potentially relying on combinations of biomarkers that include circulating factors, demographics and imaging data.

Evidence review, meta-analysis, and recommendation strength — Evidence summaries were prepared following the GRADE approach using the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool; if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not provide adequate outcome data, observational studies were also used. Two reviewers from the MG screened titles and abstracts, performed duplicate data abstraction, and independently assessed individual study risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Ottawa-Newcastle tool for observational studies. Results were pooled and meta-analyses using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager, version 5.2, were reviewed, and the confidence in effect estimates was categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low. Recommendations were either "strong" or "conditional"; conditional recommendations are synonymous with weak recommendations, and as suggested by GRADE the phrasing "we recommend" was used for strong recommendations and "we suggest" for conditional recommendations, with recommendations and their strength decided by consensus and only one recommendation requiring voting because of inadequate consensus.

### Suspected acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as an outcome measure in clinical trials [^1139eGpd]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we report that suspected acute exacerbations of IPF are common in the clinical trial setting, are clinically indistinguishable from definite acute exacerbations, and are associated with a similarly high risk of disease progression and short-term mortality. There should be no doubt that suspected acute exacerbation of IPF is a clinically important event in the lives of patients. We propose that those responsible for designing future clinical trials rethink the methodological approach to capturing acute exacerbation of IPF, and consider less restrictive criteria. Specifically, we propose recording both definite and suspected acute exacerbations of IPF, and analyzing them either as separate outcome measures or as a combined idiopathic acute worsening endpoint. Additional changes to the methodology of acute exacerbation identification in clinical trials may also be worthwhile (e.g. site-investigator-driven identification process vs. central adjudication), and studies comparing the appropriateness and feasibility of various approaches to defining and identifying acute exacerbation of IPF in clinical trials are greatly needed.

### An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline: treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An update of the 2011 clinical practice guideline [^112wsGeZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This document updates the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association guideline on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment.

Methods

Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize all available evidence pertinent to our questions. The evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists.

Results

After considering the confidence in effect estimates, the importance of outcomes studied, desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention, and implications to health equity, recommendations were made for or against specific treatment interventions.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations in favor of or against treatment interventions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: use of animal models for the preclinical assessment of potential therapies for pulmonary fibrosis [^117QsQBa]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2017). Medium credibility.

Practical aspects of fibrosis models — identify the a priori goal and match model category: Before performing in vivo modeling experiments, there should be clear ex vivo/in vitro rationale from relevant cellular experiments, and animal models can roughly be divided into those that have a strong inflammatory component and models of less inflammatory injury, with bleomycin, radiation, silica, asbestos, FITC, and many cytokine overexpression systems leading to fibrogenesis after a robust inflammatory response, whereas transgenic delivery of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, TGF-α, targeted depletion of epithelial cells, and models of IPF fibroblasts delivered to immunodeficient mice are less dependent on inflammation; use of models from each category can help determine whether the drug effect is really independent of inflammation, and determining the precise goal of experiments before deciding which in vivo platform to use is important, for example to establish potential therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, toxicity, or therapeutic windows, and to develop pharmacodynamic biomarkers for use in early-phase clinical trials, noting that both pirfenidone and nintedanib showed efficacy, albeit marginal, in more than one animal model.

### Corticosteroids in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115J8mA4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids were the mainstay of therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for more than four decades, but their efficacy is unproven and toxicities are substantial. The course of IPF is characterized by progressive respiratory insufficiency, leading to death within 3 to 8 years from the onset of symptoms. Although a subset (10–20%) of patients survives more than 10 years, there is no evidence that any form of therapy alters the natural history of the disease. Nonetheless, given the poor prognosis, a trial of corticosteroids is often given. Because of the rarity of IPF, randomized, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials have not been done. Further, no studies have compared differing dosages or duration of corticosteroid in matched patients. Interpretation of therapy efficacy is obscured by several factors including heterogeneous patient populations, inclusion of patients with histologic entities other than usual interstitial pneumonia, lack of objective, validated endpoints, different criteria for "response". We review published data regarding corticosteroid therapy for IPF and present a rationale for stratifying therapy based on host, demographic, and clinical factors that influence prognosis as well as risk for corticosteroid complications.

### An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT statement: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management [^1134FSoj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This document is an international evidence-based guideline on the diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and is a collaborative effort of the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, the Japanese Respiratory Society, and the Latin American Thoracic Association. It represents the current state of knowledge regarding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and contains sections on definition and epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, natural history, staging and prognosis, treatment, and monitoring disease course. For the diagnosis and treatment sections, pragmatic GRADE evidence-based methodology was applied in a question-based format. For each diagnosis and treatment question, the committee graded the quality of the evidence available (high, moderate, low, or very low), and made a recommendation (yes or no, strong or weak). Recommendations were based on majority vote. It is emphasized that clinicians must spend adequate time with patients to discuss patients' values and preferences and decide on the appropriate course of action.

ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline conclusions — an international, multidisciplinary committee of experts described radiological and histopathological features of UIP, diagnostic testing for IPF, and treatment of GER in IPF; defined PPF; described the physiological, radiological, and histopathological features of PPF; and addressed antifibrotic treatment of PPF. Two specific questions pertaining to the diagnosis of IPF, two specific questions pertaining to the treatment of IPF, and two specific questions pertaining to the use of pharmacotherapy for PPF were answered with evidence-based, graded recommendations. These recommendations are not mandates, because they cannot account for all unique clinical circumstances, and they should be revisited as new evidence is published, and it was determined that none of the recommendations are appropriate targets for performance measures.

What this study adds

This is the first review to identify miRNAs presenting similar alteration in COVID-19 and IPF. Interestingly, these miRNAs are key regulators of fibrosis processes. The deregulation of these fibrotic-related miRNAs may participate in the development of fibrotic lesions in the lung of post-COVID-19 patients.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development? [^113ckTe9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines have undergone an incredible transformation over the last number of years. Significant advances include explicit linkages of systematic evidence summaries to the strength and direction of recommendations, consideration of all patient-important factors, transparent reporting of the recommendation generation process including conflict of interest management strategies and the production of clinical practice guidelines which use simple and clear language. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology provides a framework for guideline development and was employed to produce the recently published ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT update on treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Herein we discuss the advantages of using an evidence-based approach for guideline development using the IPF process and resultant document as an example.

### Is pulmonary fibrosis a precancerous disease? [^111JPQum]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common type of interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by a histopathological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia with progressive fibrosis of the pulmonary epithelium. The incidence of IPF is increasing worldwide as the population ages and with that, there is a concomitant increase in the incidence of lung cancer in these patients who are living longer with the disease. The average length of time for lung cancer development following an IPF diagnosis is 3 years. Given the high prevalence of lung cancer among patients with pulmonary fibrosis, we wondered if pulmonary fibrosis could be classified as a precancerous disease. We provided support from the Pubmed published literature to investigate whether pulmonary fibrosis meets the five criteria of the National Cancer Institute's definition of premalignant conditions for classification as a precancerous disease. We found out pulmonary fibrosis meets the five criteria of the National Cancer Institute's definition of a premalignant condition and can be considered a precancerous disease. To identify early lung cancer in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, regular screening with HRCT and PET-CT scans is highly recommended for these patients.

### Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An international working group report [^116z56bm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been defined as an acute, clinically significant, respiratory deterioration of unidentifiable cause. The objective of this international working group report on acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was to provide a comprehensive update on the topic. A literature review was conducted to identify all relevant English text publications and abstracts. Evidence-based updates on the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, prognosis, and management of acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are provided. Finally, to better reflect the current state of knowledge and improve the feasibility of future research into its etiology and treatment, the working group proposes a new conceptual framework for acute respiratory deterioration in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and a revised definition and diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### CC-90001, a C-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, in patients with pulmonary fibrosis: design of a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^113dugo5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and often fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD); other ILDs have a progressive, fibrotic phenotype (PF-ILD). Antifibrotic agents can slow but not stop disease progression in patients with IPF or PF-ILD. c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are stress-activated protein kinases implicated in the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis, including epithelial cell death, inflammation and polarisation of profibrotic macrophages, fibroblast activation and collagen production. CC-90001, an orally administered (PO), one time per day, JNK inhibitor, is being evaluated in IPF and PF-ILD.

Methods and analysis

This is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy and safety of CC-90001 in patients with IPF (main study) and patients with PF-ILD (substudy). Both include an 8-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period, up to an 80-week active-treatment extension and a 4-week post-treatment follow-up. Patients with IPF (n = 165) will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive 200 mg or 400 mg CC-90001 or placebo administered PO one time per day; up to 25 patients/arm will be permitted concomitant pirfenidone use. Forty-five patients in the PF-ILD substudy will be randomised 2:1 to receive 400 mg CC-90001 or placebo. The primary endpoint is change in per cent predicted forced vital capacity from baseline to Week 24 in patients with IPF.

Ethics and dissemination

This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki principles and local ethical and legal requirements. Results will be reported in a peer-reviewed publication.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^11798ePg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) — conclusions highlight that tertiary prevention strategies focusing on established pulmonary fibrosis have had limited impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with ILD, and that identifying individuals before clinically evident lung fibrosis (when findings qualify as ILA) provides an opportunity to intervene before the lung is extensively and irreversibly scarred if effective and well-tolerated treatments can be identified; the document presents a comprehensive literature review of ILAs that supports updates to the previous ILA definition made by the Fleischner Society, establishes a working definition of ILD, and provides evidence-based suggestions for the evaluation and management of ILAs; together, these advances will improve clinical care and support future research by standardizing the approach to ILAs; it also highlights unanswered questions and emphasizes the need to identify treatment options for ILA.

Age considerations for fibrosis models — idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of advanced age; however, most biomedical research is performed in mice 6–8 weeks old. Estimates have been made to correlate the relative age of mice to human age equivalents, with Table 1 listing 8–12 wk ~20 yr, 10–12 mo 38–47 yr old, and 18–24 mo 56–69 yr old (typical IPF diagnosis time). "Studies assessing bleomycin in older mice revealed more exuberant fibrosis, but this remained associated with enhanced inflammatory responses", and "infectious insult with murine γherpesvirus can induce worse fibrosis in mice aged 15–24 months compared with younger mice". Taken together, "aged mice may more closely reflect human pulmonary fibrosis".

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis guideline — conclusions and framework: A comprehensive synthesis of evidence was performed, diagnostic criteria for IPF were updated, and a multidisciplinary committee formulated recommendations for individual diagnostic tests, while the panel notes it did not evaluate whether these tests had utility for other purposes such as prognosis or treatment response. A new feature is that a different approach is often recommended depending on whether the patient's high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or something other than UIP (probable UIP, indeterminate for UIP, or alternative diagnosis), and the document states these recommendations should be reconsidered as new evidence becomes available.

### The revised ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) – practical implications [^112mQBaa]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

A deficiency common to all guideline statements is the absence of pragmatic guidance on the level of risk of SLB in individual patients. A clearer separation between patients who can undergo a SLB with an acceptably low risk and those in whom SLB should be avoided would be helpful to clinicians. The presence of major co-morbidity is an obvious contraindication to SLB but the level of severity of IPF associated with a significant increase in post-operative mortality has not been sufficiently addressed. It is acknowledged that in the absence of definitive data, broad statements based on indirect evidence might be required. However, guidance on this point, even based solely on expert opinion, would be extremely useful as a means of facilitating patient participation in decisions based on "risk-benefit" thinking.

### Corticosteroids for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113vaMri]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also called cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), is a lethal form of diffuse lung disorder of unknown origin; the mean survival being two to four years. Currently recommended and most prescribed therapy for IPF is based on the use of systemic corticosteroids, even if no formal demonstration of efficacy of this treatment of IPF is available. Furthermore, new insights from pathological studies have produced a new hypothesis, based upon the central role played by aberrant wound healing following repeated lung injury, weakening the rationale basis of the use of corticosteroids in IPF, previously considered simply a chronic inflammatory disease.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of adults with IPF.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2002) and EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2002) and reference lists of articles. We searched reference lists of published articles to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) using corticosteroids alone for the treatment of adults with IPF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts of identified articles were retrieved and articles possibly fulfilling inclusion criteria were retrieved in full. Two reviewers would have independently assessed trial quality if there had been any included studies.

Main Results

Fifteen studies were selected as potentially eligible for meta-analysis. After further analysis of full text papers, no RCTs or CCTs were identified as suitable and therefore no data was available for inclusion in any meta-analysis. All studies were excluded due to inadequate methodologies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

At present, there is no evidence for an effect of corticosteroid treatment in patients with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Given developments in understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF, randomised controlled trials designed to test the efficacy of corticosteroids will probably never be designed. As other forms of pulmonary fibrosis such as non-specific interstitial pneumonia are reported to show a better response to corticosteroids, it is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis in each patient. Moreover, therapies with immunomodulatory rather than anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects may be more promising for the effective treatment of IPF/UIP.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112RRSJX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) definition in interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF — In a patient with ILD of known or unknown etiology other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who has radiological evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, PPF is defined as at least two of three criteria occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation: worsening respiratory symptoms; physiological evidence of disease progression with absolute decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 5% predicted within 1 yr of follow-up or absolute decline in Dlco (corrected for Hb) > 10% predicted within 1 yr of follow-up; and radiological evidence of disease progression, including increased extent or severity of traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, new ground-glass opacity with traction bronchiectasis, new fine reticulation, increased extent or increased coarseness of reticular abnormality, new or increased honeycombing, or increased lobar volume loss. The table notes that it is critical to exclude alternative explanations for worsening features, particularly when symptoms worsen and/or Dlco declines, given the lower specificity of these features for PPF compared with FVC and chest computed tomography.

### Effect of antifibrotic therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis undergoing lung transplant in the peri and post-operative period [^116QU1KE]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease with high mortality. Lung transplant remains a cornerstone of treatment despite the advent of antifibrotic therapy. In light of the increasing number of patients on antifibrotic therapy prior to lung transplantation it is paramount to demonstrate these medications do not augment postoperative complications following transplant.

Research Question

Does antifibrotic therapy increase perioperative complications and mortality in lung transplant recipients?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients actively listed for lung transplant at Temple University Hospital from June 2014 to April 2017 with a listing diagnosis of IPF. Subjects who received treatment with antifibrotic therapy (either pirfenidone or nintedanib) up until the time of lung transplantation were compared to subjects not on therapy. Data was collected regarding baseline demographics, pulmonary function tests, IPF exacerbations, perioperative bleeding and cardiac events, and outcomes in the postoperative period.

Results

A total of 94 subjects were included in the study: 42 subjects on antifibrotic therapy (28 pirfenidone, 14 nintedanib) and 52 subjects not on therapy in the pre-transplant period. Baseline characteristics were similar between study groups. Subjects treated with antifibrotic therapy pre-transplant were noted to have less FVC decline, fewer hospitalizations, and greater weight loss while on the transplant waiting list. No difference in post-transplant airway anastomosis complications, bleeding or mortality was observed between study groups.

Interpretation

Subjects with IPF on antifibrotic therapy prior to lung transplantation had better preservation of lung function in the pre-transplant period, and similar outcomes in the postoperative period compared to those not on antifibrotic therapy before lung transplant.

Regarding medical management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to general principles, BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no therapy proven to improve survival or otherwise significantly modify the clinical course of IPF. Consider offering recruitment to high quality clinical trials of therapy and/or for lung transplantation if appropriate in all patients with IPF.

Defining PPF

Consensus was reached that, considering PPF as defined in the international guideline or the phenomenon of progressive fibrosing ILD, 'despite adequate management' or 'despite usual management' should be included in the definition of progression (Fig. 5 and Table S7 in Additional file 1). There was consensus that general respirologists, specialists in related areas and policy makers/payers would find the guideline definition useful (Fig. 5), but consensus was not reached that this definition would be useful to ILD experts, healthcare professionals outside speciality fields, or patients (Table S7 in Additional file 1). Consensus was not reached on whether progression occurring within 12 months or over a longer interval should both be considered as PPF (Table S7 in Additional file 1).

Diagnostic criteria and evaluation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis — Diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and either the presence of the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or specific combinations of HRCT patterns and histopathology patterns in patients subjected to lung tissue sampling; patients with suspected IPF are initially evaluated for identifiable causes of ILD, and if a potential cause is found a thorough evaluation is undertaken to confirm or exclude hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease (CTD), pneumoconiosis, and iatrogenic causes, whereas if no specific diagnosis or cause is identified, clinical findings and HRCT are considered during MDD to either ascertain or exclude the diagnosis of IPF, and IPF is diagnosed if the appropriate combination of HRCT patterns and histopathological patterns are present.

Pulmonary fibrosis translational pipeline — integrated human and preclinical data: The panel's recommendations are for an integrated approach to drug development using both relevant animal models and appropriate ex vivo/in vitro approaches to provide robust validation of pharmacological mechanisms of action and a dosing framework. Target validation should involve annotated human specimens, and an integrated approach that tests effects of compounds on established fibrosis should help move promising targets to clinical trials.

Part II: Diagnosis and Treatment of PPF in Fibrotic ILD, Other than IPF

Definition of PPF

In a patient with ILD of known or unknown etiology other than IPF who has radiological evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, PPF is defined as at least two of the following three criteria occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation (Table 4):

Table 4.
Definition of Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis

1 worsening respiratory symptoms;
2 physiological evidence of disease progression, as defined below; and
3 radiological evidence of disease progression, as defined below.

Although it is critical to exclude alternative explanations of worsening features for all patients with suspected progression, this is particularly important in patients with worsening respiratory symptoms and/or decline in D CO given the lower specificity of these features for PPF compared with FVC and chest CT.

The guideline committee emphasized four points. First, PPF is defined separately from IPF, which was defined in previous guidelines (Figure 12). Second, PPF is not a diagnosis, and the definition of PPF is agnostic to the underlying condition. Representative fibrotic lung diseases that can manifest PPF are listed in Table 5. Third, the criteria for PPF reflect multiple clinical trials because the committee believed that no single trial should guide antifibrotic therapy. Even though trials used different criteria, they identified populations whose disease progressed similarly. Finally, the criteria for PPF have been associated only with prognosis; it is unclear if they also identify patients best suited for antifibrotic therapy.

### Syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT research statement [^1134v8jv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) — acute exacerbation features and prognosis: acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been reported in patients with CPFE; risk factors for acute exacerbation in CPFE may be similar to IPF, including worse Gender-Age-Physiology score and the presence of lung cancer, particularly after surgery; diffuse ground-glass and/or consolidation on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) helps to differentiate exacerbations of fibrosis from exacerbations of emphysema in CPFE; the prognosis of acute exacerbation in CPFE might be better than that of isolated IPF.

### Advances in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis [^117Nv1VM]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Similarly to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other interstitial lung diseases can develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) characterized by declining lung function, a poor response to immunomodulatory therapies, and early mortality. The pathophysiology of disordered lung repair involves common downstream pathways that lead to pulmonary fibrosis in both IPF and PPF. The antifibrotic drugs, such as nintedanib, are indicated for the treatment of IPF and PPF, and new therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials. Clinical, radiographic, and molecular biomarkers are needed to identify patients with PPF and subgroups of patients likely to respond to specific therapies. This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of specific therapies in patients with IPF and PPF, discusses agents being considered in clinical trials, and considers potential biomarkers based on disease pathogenesis that might be used to provide a personalized approach to care.

### Is fibrosis really fibrosis? [^112Z2d8L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest van Gassel and colleagues' report of pulmonary sequelae in mechanically ventilated survivors of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and commend the authors on their systematic assessment of these patients. We hope the authors could help clarify some of our queries.

van Gassel and colleagues report a remarkably high prevalence of fibrosis in their cohort (91.3%), but it is possible that the definition of fibrosis used requires further consideration. The etiology and trajectory of fibrous bands remains uncertain, but they could represent areas of consolidation seen in organizing pneumonia, which regress with time. It would be interesting to learn what proportion of patients with fibrous bands had other signs of fibrosis (volume loss and/or architectural distortion and/or traction bronchiectasis) and whether using an altered definition including the aforementioned features of fibrosis would significantly change the prevalence rates.

We appreciate that not all patients were screened for pulmonary embolism as per the authors' comments, but regardless, it would be interesting to know what proportion of patients underwent a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram during their acute admission and the incidence of pulmonary embolism, as this could have accounted for the hypoperfusion seen on CT imaging. Even in the absence of detectable pulmonary embolism, microthrombosis, only detectable using dual-energy CT imaging, could add further challenges to high-resolution CT interpretation.

Twenty-five percent of patients showing new emphysematous destruction or cavitation is a very interesting finding. Cystic changes have been noted in mechanically ventilated patients, and as a complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of these cysts includes infarction or fibrosis, so what is reported as emphysema could in fact be ARDS-related cystic change. CT imaging performed between admission and follow-up may provide insights into the timing and rate of development of these changes. The authors suggest this is a new finding compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, but this may simply reflect the severity of ARDS caused by COVID-19.

### Therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115mNZKR]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease. After many drugs failed in clinical trials, improvements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF led to the approval of two drugs that slow the progression of the disease. However, the prognosis for patients with IPF remains poor and the search continues for drugs that inhibit the pathogenic pathways active in IPF to reduce or even halt the progression of the disease. In this article, we review the mechanisms of action of the two approved therapies for IPF (nintedanib and pirfenidone) and of the investigational compounds that are in Phase II trials and discuss the potential for combination therapy in the treatment of IPF.

Conclusions

This modified Delphi process provided consensus statements on the identification of ILD progression that were supported by a broad group of clinicians and may help to inform clinical practice until more robust evidence-based guidelines are available.
