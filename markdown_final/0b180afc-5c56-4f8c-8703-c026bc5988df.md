## Question

Why do some patients get the impella pump

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why some patients get an Impella pump and how to frame the rationale, indications, timing, and outcomes for its use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock and the hemodynamic goals of mechanical circulatory support. Then, I should verify the approved indications and device variants. Next, I will examine the physiologic mechanisms that make Impella attractive. After that, I need to review the strength and limits of the evidence, including randomized and observational data. Then, I should consider patient selection, contraindications, and timing. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, grounded answer that aligns with guidelines and real-world practice patterns, making sure I don't overstate benefits or understate risks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem we are solving: cardiogenic shock is a low-output, high-mortality state driven by primary cardiac failure with systemic hypoperfusion. In this context, the goals of MCS are to restore perfusion, unload the failing ventricle, reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and stabilize end-organ function while buying time for recovery or definitive therapy, so any device justification must map to these targets [^112gbZPR] [^115Rrxid].

> I need to check the approved indications and device portfolio: guideline documents and device approvals indicate Impella use in high-risk PCI with anticipated hemodynamic instability, acute cardiogenic shock from acute MI or other etiologies, and select decompensated heart failure scenarios, with specific durations by device (Impella 2.5/CP up to about 4 days, 5.0 up to 10 days, and 5.5 up to 14 days in the US), while Impella RP is indicated for acute right heart failure, so selection is tailored to etiology and support duration needs [^113eG7f8] [^113y7Mgk] [^115U29S6].

> Now, I will examine the physiologic rationale. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without unpacking mechanisms: Impella provides direct transvalvular microaxial flow from the LV into the aorta, which actively unloads the LV, augments cardiac output, reduces filling pressures, and lowers myocardial oxygen consumption. Importantly, its output is independent of intrinsic LV function and rhythm, unlike IABP which relies on cardiac rhythm and primarily modulates afterload rather than directly increasing forward flow, so in severe shock with low-output physiology, Impella's direct unloading and forward flow can be advantageous [^1135GFxz] [^115UXDi9] [^116rhrTT].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit we are claiming. The ISAR-SHOCK randomized trial in AMI-CS showed a greater increase in cardiac index with Impella than IABP at 30 minutes, but mortality was not different, so I should avoid overstating survival benefit at 30 days from that small study and focus on hemodynamic gains and clinical context instead [^113uQKAi] [^11698VyC].

> Next, I should review randomized and observational outcome data to calibrate expectations. IMPRESS, a contemporary randomized trial in AMICS with very high arrest rates, found no mortality difference between Impella CP and IABP at 30 days, while PROTECT II in high-risk PCI showed no 30-day MACE difference but a 90-day per-protocol improvement favoring Impella 2.5, and multiple observational cohorts report no consistent mortality benefit but consistent hemodynamic improvement. However, recent randomized data from the DanGer Shock program in STEMI-CS suggested reduced 180-day mortality with early Impella use, which begins to reshape practice and timing considerations in selected patients [^113uQKAi] [^115KqYwz] [^116tLjar].

> I should double-check the evidence for high-risk PCI. Real-world analyses and meta-analyses show improved procedural hemodynamics with Impella, lower in-hospital MI and shock rates versus IABP in some datasets, and acceptable complication profiles in experienced centers, but there is no definitive mortality benefit and selection and timing likely drive outcomes, so prophylactic placement before complex PCI in patients with low EF remains a common and reasonable strategy in high-volume centers [^1113QA87] [^1169dowS] [^115AvYBW].

> Hold on, I should verify patient selection and contraindications so I don't overgeneralize. Absolute contraindications include LV thrombus, mechanical aortic valve, severe aortic stenosis, moderate or greater aortic regurgitation, severe peripheral arterial disease precluding access, and active insertion-site infection, while relative issues include small-caliber vessels, heavy calcification, and severe right heart failure where LV preload cannot be sustained. Risk scores and biomarker-based models are emerging to refine selection, but they remain adjuncts to clinical judgment in shock teams [^113uQKAi] [^112LU4Kj] [^112gbZPR].

> Let me consider timing, because this is where practice has shifted. Multiple registries and observational studies suggest that pre-PCI or early Impella in AMI-CS and high-risk PCI is associated with lower bleeding and better 1-year outcomes, and preclinical and translational work hints that very early LV unloading before reperfusion may confer myocardial protection, though I need to emphasize that much of this remains observational and hypothesis-generating pending larger randomized confirmation [^114vvkHW] [^112Ln4er].

> I will now examine right-sided failure, since some patients get Impella RP rather than left-sided pumps. RECOVER RIGHT demonstrated hemodynamic benefit with 73% 30-day survival and 62% 180-day survival in pooled cohorts, but real-world series and FDA communications highlight high bleeding and mortality in off-label contexts, and a 2019 safety communication warned against use outside the defined post-LVAD and post-cardiotomy settings, so device choice must align with etiology, timing, and anatomy to avoid harm [^115U29S6] [^117Bqips] [^111wBvR5].

> But wait, what about device strategy when VA-ECMO is already in place? VA-ECMO increases LV afterload and can cause distension, so LV unloading with an Impella (ECPELLA) is increasingly used to mitigate pulmonary edema and facilitate weaning, and although observational signals suggest improved weaning and potential mortality benefit, randomized data are lacking and practice remains center-specific with attention to cannulation, anticoagulation, and imaging surveillance for thrombosis and migration [^113LLgyc] [^115suCgj] [^115bDesX].

> Next, I should review real-world durability and complications so I don't understate risk. Large registries and contemporary cohorts show substantial bleeding, hemolysis, vascular ischemia, and stroke risks, and the Impella 5.5, often via axillary access to enable mobilization, is favored over femoral CP for prolonged support in many shock centers, with contemporary data suggesting longer support durations and higher survival to explant compared with 5.0, though these are observational comparisons and require cautious interpretation [^1135GFxz] [^115coa1p] [^116JLiFM].

> Let me reconsider the practical decision flow to ensure I am not missing anything. Patients typically receive Impella when cardiogenic shock or high-risk PCI physiology is present, when IABP-level support is judged insufficient, when anatomy and contraindications permit safe implantation, when an experienced MCS team can manage complications, and when the goal is either stabilization to recovery, bridge to decision, or bridge to transplant or durable LVAD. Guidelines support consideration in these settings while emphasizing early use, vigilant monitoring, and a plan for escalation or weaning, which I should explicitly anchor in the institutional protocol rather than imply uniform benefit [^113uQKAi] [^116SASZT].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis stays precise: some patients get Impella because it provides superior hemodynamic unloading and forward flow compared with IABP in acute LV failure scenarios, enables stabilization across AMI-CS, decompensated HF, high-risk PCI, and postcardiotomy shock, and offers a pathway to recovery or heart replacement therapy. Randomized data have not consistently shown short-term mortality benefit versus IABP, but emerging trials like DanGer Shock suggest longer-term survival gains with early use in STEMI-CS, and observational data plus evolving practice patterns support earlier, protocolized deployment in experienced centers, with device choice and timing individualized to etiology, hemodynamics, anatomy, and center expertise [^1135GFxz] [^116tLjar] [^114vvkHW] [^113uQKAi].

Patients receive an Impella pump when they need **temporary mechanical circulatory support** [^1135GFxz] for **cardiogenic shock** [^113uQKAi] or **high-risk PCI** [^113eG7f8], with the goals of restoring perfusion, unloading the left ventricle, and bridging to recovery, transplant, or durable LVAD [^112zddf5]. Impella is indicated for acute MI with shock [^113uQKAi], decompensated heart failure [^115xKcav], postcardiotomy shock [^111N415Z], and high-risk PCI with low EF or complex lesions [^11578LV6]; it is also used for right heart failure via Impella RP [^117Bqips] and for LV unloading with VA-ECMO [^113LLgyc]. It is **not used for chronic heart failure**, mechanical aortic valves, severe aortic stenosis, or aortic regurgitation [^113dKAAX] [^113uQKAi]. Early Impella placement improves hemodynamics and may reduce mortality in selected patients [^112Ln4er] [^114vvkHW], but risks include bleeding, vascular injury, hemolysis, and stroke [^1135GFxz] [^114SD75E].

## Clinical indications for Impella pump placement

### Cardiogenic shock

- **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**: Impella is indicated for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock [^113uQKAi], providing hemodynamic support and ventricular unloading [^113eG7f8].
- **Decompensated heart failure**: Used for acute decompensated heart failure with low cardiac output and organ dysfunction [^115xKcav].
- **Postcardiotomy shock**: Applied after cardiac surgery when patients fail to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass [^111N415Z] or develop low cardiac output [^11177n3Q].

---

### High-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

During high-risk PCI, Impella is used in patients with **severely reduced ejection fraction (≤ 35%)** [^113eG7f8] to maintain hemodynamic stability during complex interventions [^117S2Ska]. It is also indicated for complex coronary lesions — such as left main, multivessel, or last remaining conduit disease — in patients with low EF or high risk of hemodynamic compromise [^116SASZT] [^1175uw2W].

---

### Right ventricular failure

Impella RP supports **acute right ventricular failure** — including post-LVAD implantation, post-cardiotomy, or acute pulmonary embolism [^115U29S6] providing up to 4 L/min of flow [^117Bqips].

---

### Left ventricular unloading with VA-ECMO

With VA-ECMO, **Impella is used to unload the left ventricle** [^115suCgj], reducing pulmonary edema and improving myocardial recovery [^112MNbjy].

---

## Physiological benefits of Impella pump

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Increases cardiac output and mean arterial pressure, improving organ perfusion [^115UXDi9].
- **Ventricular unloading**: Reduces LV wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption, aiding recovery [^115UXDi9].
- **Coronary perfusion**: Enhances coronary blood flow, particularly beneficial in AMI [^1135GFxz].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Selection considers **hemodynamic severity** — typically a cardiac index < 2.2 L/min/m² or the need for multiple inotropes/vasopressors [^1158kESc]. Anatomic suitability requires assessment of vascular anatomy, aortic valve function, and the absence of LV thrombus [^112LU4Kj] [^114XhXZK]. Clinical goals include bridging to recovery, transplant, or durable LVAD, and use in high-risk PCI or refractory cardiogenic shock [^113uQKAi].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Absolute contraindications include mechanical aortic valves, **severe aortic stenosis**, **moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation**, LV thrombus, aortic dissection, and severe peripheral arterial disease [^113dKAAX] [^113uQKAi]. Relative contraindications include small access vessels, heavy calcification, active infection, and coagulopathy [^112LU4Kj].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- **Survival**: Survival to discharge is ~67% in contemporary CS cohorts [^1119M2Vj]; early Impella use may improve outcomes [^114vvkHW].
- **Complications**: Major bleeding, vascular injury, hemolysis, stroke, and device-related issues are recognized risks [^1135GFxz] [^114SD75E].

## Comparison with other mechanical circulatory support devices

| **Attribute** | **Impella** | **Iabp** | **Va-ecmo** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hemodynamic support | High (2.5–5.5 L/min) | Moderate (0.5–1.0 L/min) | High (4–6 L/min) |
| Ventricular unloading | Direct LV unloading | Minimal unloading | LV afterload increase |
| Complications | Bleeding, hemolysis, stroke | Vascular injury, limited efficacy | Bleeding, limb ischemia, LV distension |
| Clinical use | CS, high-risk PCI, RV failure | CS, high-risk PCI | Refractory CS, respiratory failure |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from **ISCHELT/HFSA** endorse Impella for CS, high-risk PCI, and RV failure [^113uQKAi] while emphasizing careful patient selection and monitoring [^112tf9Wm]. SCAI/ACC/HFSA guidance highlights the need for multidisciplinary teams and protocolized care to optimize outcomes [^11578LV6].

---

## Conclusion

Impella is used for **temporary circulatory support** in cardiogenic shock, high-risk PCI, and RV failure, providing hemodynamic stabilization and ventricular unloading [^1135GFxz]. Patient selection, timing, and complications guide its use, and emerging evidence supports early deployment in selected patients [^112Ln4er].

### A prospective, randomized clinical trial of hemodynamic support with impella 2.5 versus intra-aortic balloon pump in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention: the PROTECT II study [^115KqYwz]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although coronary artery bypass grafting is generally preferred in symptomatic patients with severe, complex multivessel, or left main disease, some patients present with clinical features that make coronary artery bypass grafting clinically unattractive. Percutaneous coronary intervention with hemodynamic support may be feasible for these patients. Currently, there is no systematic comparative evaluation of hemodynamic support devices for this indication.

Methods and Results

We randomly assigned 452 symptomatic patients with complex 3-vessel disease or unprotected left main coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (n = 226) or Impella 2.5 (n = 226) support during nonemergent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary end point was the 30-day incidence of major adverse events. A 90-day follow-up was required, as well, by protocol. Impella 2.5 provided superior hemodynamic support in comparison with IABP, with maximal decrease in cardiac power output from baseline of -0.04 ± 0.24 W in comparison with -0.14 ± 0.27 W for IABP (P = 0.001). The primary end point (30-day major adverse events) was not statistically different between groups: 35.1% for Impella 2.5 versus 40.1% for IABP, P = 0.227 in the intent-to-treat population and 34.3% versus 42.2%, P = 0.092 in the per protocol population. At 90 days, a strong trend toward decreased major adverse events was observed in Impella 2.5-supported patients in comparison with IABP: 40.6% versus 49.3%, P = 0.066 in the intent-to-treat population and 40.0% versus 51.0%, P = 0.023 in the per protocol population, respectively.

Conclusions

The 30-day incidence of major adverse events was not different for patients with IABP or Impella 2.5 hemodynamic support. However, trends for improved outcomes were observed for Impella 2.5-supported patients at 90 days.

### 2015 SCAI / ACC / HFSA / STS clinical expert consensus statement on the use of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices in cardiovascular care (endorsed by the American Heart Association, the cardiological society of India, and sociedad latino americana de cardiologia intervencion; affirmation of value by the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology-association canadienne de cardiologie D'intervention) [^115UXDi9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Medium credibility.

Impella hemodynamic effects — The Impella pumps blood from the left ventricle (LV) into the ascending aorta, thereby unloading the LV and increasing forward flow, and it reduces myocardial oxygen consumption, improves mean arterial pressure, and reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The Impella 2.5 provides a greater increase in cardiac output than the IABP but less than the TandemHeart device, while the more powerful Impella CP and 5.0 devices are comparable to the TandemHeart device in terms of support. Similar to the TandemHeart, adequate right ventricular (RV) function or concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) is necessary to maintain LV preload and hemodynamic support during biventricular failure or unstable ventricular arrhythmias.

### Timing of impella implantation and outcomes in cardiogenic shock or high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization [^114vvkHW]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of the microaxial percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device (Impella® pump) implantation pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus during/after PCI in cardiogenic shock (CS) and high-risk PCI populations.

Background

A better understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the Impella and the role of timing of this support initiation in specific clinical settings is of utmost clinical relevance.

Methods

A total of 365 patients treated with Impella 2.5/CP in the 17 centers of the IMP-IT Registry were included. Through propensity-score weighting (PSW) analysis, 1-year clinical outcomes were assessed separately in CS and HR-PCI patients, stratified by timing of Impella support.

Results

Pre-procedural insertion was associated with an improvement in 1-year survival in patients with CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with PCI (p = .04 before PSW, p = .009 after PSW) and HR-PCI (p < .01 both before and after PSW). Among patients undergoing HR-PCI, early Impella support was also associated with a lower rate of the composite of mortality, re-hospitalization for heart failure, and need for left-ventricular assist device/heart transplantation at 1-year (p = .04 before PSW, p = .01 after PSW). Furthermore, Impella use during/after PCI was associated with an increased in-hospital life-threatening and severe bleeding among patients with AMI-CS receiving PCI (7 vs. 16%, p = .1) and HR-PCI (1 vs. 9%, p = .02).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested a survival benefit and reduced rates of major bleeding when a pre-PCI Impella implantation instead of during-after procedure was used in the setting of HR-PCI and AMI-CS.

### The cVAD registry for percutaneous temporary hemodynamic support: a prospective registry of impella mechanical circulatory support use in high-risk PCI, cardiogenic shock, and decompensated heart failure [^1175BT6q]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Management of patients requiring temporary, mechanical hemodynamic support during high- risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or in cardiogenic shock is rapidly evolving. With the availability of the Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0, LD, and RP percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices, there is a need for continued surveillance of outcomes. Three factors underline the importance of a registry for these populations. First, large randomized trials of hemodynamic support, involving cardiogenic shock, are challenging to conduct. Second, there is increasing interest in the use of registries to provide "real-world" experience and to allow the flexibility to evaluate individual patient uses and outcomes. Third, current, large databases have not captured the specific impact of mechanical support treatment of cardiogenic shock. The predecessor to the catheter-based ventricular assist devices registry, known as USpella, began in 2009 with paper data acquisition but beginning in 2011 transferred to electronic data capture, enrolling 3,339 patients through 2016. Throughout, registry data have been used to assess the outcomes of Impella therapy, leading to 8 publications and 4 Food and Drug Administration premarket approvals covering multiple indications and Impella devices. Going forward, the registry will continue to assess not only in-hospital outcomes but long-term follow-up to 1 year. In addition, data management will be enhanced to assess quality and clinical experiences. The registry will also provide a mechanism for postmarketing surveillance. This manuscript reviews the ongoing catheter-based ventricular assist devices registry design, management, and contributions of the registry data. The upgraded registry will provide a more robust opportunity to assess acute and late outcomes of current and future device use worldwide.

Condensed Abstract

The current catheter-based ventricular assist devices registry is an international database documenting outcomes with temporary Impella hemodynamic support. The registry has supported 8 publications and 4 Food and Drug Administration premarket approvals since its inception in 2009. The current registry is more robust containing outcomes up to 1 year postprocedure.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^112MNbjy]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) with VA-ECMO — medical management and evidence include that inotropic support can enhance aortic valve opening by increasing myocardial contractility, but inotropes increase myocardial oxygen consumption and total LV work; vasodilators also can decrease afterload and may allow increasing aortic valve opening, although vasodilator use is often limited owing to low systemic blood pressure in the setting of CS. The IABP has a well-known 2-fold benefit: augmentation of coronary blood flow during diastole and decreasing afterload, and some centers routinely place an IABP for all patients on VA-ECMO, convinced of its significant reduction of PCWP. One European study demonstrated an important reduction in radiographic signs of pulmonary edema and more days off mechanical ventilation in patients with combined IABP-ECMO vs those on VA-ECMO alone, and in patients with CS requiring VA-ECMO, the concomitant use of IABP has been associated with significantly lower mortality, although direct unloading by the concomitant use of a (more expensive) Impella device might be even more effective. However, a recent large pooled analysis of more than 1500 patients showed no survival benefit by adding IABP to VA-ECMO.

### Gaps and knowledge in the contemporary management of acute right ventricular failure [^111wBvR5]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Impella RP

Impella RP (Abiomed) is a 22F 3-dimensional catheter-based microaxial flow pump delivered percutaneously under fluoroscopy guidance, mostly from the femoral vein. It delivers blood from the inferior cava vein-RA to the PA, directly unloading the RV. It can provide a forward flow in the range of 3.5 to 4 L/min, and its utilization is intended for up to 14 days. The RECOVER RIGHT trial evaluated the utilization of Impella RP in 30 patients with medically refractory ARVF, showing immediate improvement in hemodynamics and rapid weaning from inotropes and vasopressors. The survival rate at 30 days was 73%, and all discharged patients were alive at 6 months. Bleeding complications were seen in 60% of patients and hemolysis in < 20%. Since the aforementioned trial, several nonrandomized small-sized studies assessed the use of Impella RP in ARVF of different etiologies,– (Table 2).

Table 2.
Clinical Studies Evaluating Mechanical Support Devices for Treatment of Acute Right Ventricular Failure

While all studies confirmed the positive hemodynamic effects, the mortality rate was usually higher than in the RECOVER RIGHT trial, and morbidity remained poor due to frequent vascular, bleeding, and hemolysis complications. Due to these results, the FDA issued an official recall for excess mortality in Impella RP recipients.

Recently, Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist (Abiomed), which is an 11-F cannula inserted through the internal jugular vein with a 22F peel-away sheath, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ARVF for up to 14 days. Although this configuration allows early mobilization, consistent data are still not available, and this device was recently recalled by the FDA for the reported high frequency of blood clots, especially with ACT levels below 160 seconds.

### 2021: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure [^114y1UwE]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for PCS — There are no RCTs for ECMO effectiveness in PCS, and retrospective studies report that mortality ranges from 60% to 70%. In a European registry report of close to 700 patients with a systematic review and meta-analysis of nearly 2500 patients, mortality was 43% to 75% with universal concomitant IABP use, and switching to peripheral cannulation appeared to provide close to a 10% mortality benefit. ECMO with left ventricle (LV) unloading appears to provide a 10% to 20% mortality benefit in 2 recent studies, including a multicenter study using Impella and a meta-analysis predominantly unloaded with an IABP.

### Short term outcomes of impella circulatory support for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169dowS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Aim of this study is to evaluate short term safety and efficacy of Impella in high risk percutaneous coronary intervention (HR-PCI) population.

Background

While several studies demonstrated the clinical significance of Impella in HR-PCI, few data exist about its impact on short term outcome.

Methods

All studies reporting short term outcomes of PCI with any Impella device were included. The primary endpoint was either in-hospital or 30-day mortality, while vascular complications, post-procedural stroke, post-procedural dialysis and bleeding complications were assessed as secondary outcomes.

Results

Nine studies with 7448 patients were included. Median age was 69.5years old (67–73), with a mean ejection fraction of 29.7% (20%-39%) and a Syntax score of 30.2 (25. 5–33, interquartile [IQR]). Impella 2.5 was the most commonly used axial flow pump used to support these PCIs (88.7%). In-hospital death was observed in 5.09% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.69–6.49, I² = 78%), while vascular complications in 2.53% of patients (1.07–4.00, I² = 89%) and post-procedural stroke in 2.77% of patients (0.50–6.05, I² = 98%). Major bleeding occurred in 5.98% of patients (3.66–8.31, I² = 90%) and post-procedural dialysis in 4.44% of patients (1.50–7.37, I² = 93% all CI 93%).

Conclusion

Use of Impella in high risk PCI appears to have an acceptable rate of complication, especially regarding vascular complications and major bleedings.

### Single center first year experience and outcomes with impella 5.5 left ventricular assist device [^113y7Mgk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In the United States, current Impella 5.5® use has been approved for 14 days. In Europe, the approval is extended to 30 days. Our center has successfully used the Impella 5.5® for periods longer than 14 days in range of 15 to 80 days. For the patients who were implanted for greater than 14 days, the survival rate to hospital discharge was 64%. Improved hemodynamics and organ perfusion similar to the entire cohort was confirmed with invasive hemodynamic and laboratory. Our center's experience supports the hypothesis that the Impella 5.5® is a durable alternative for left ventricular mechanical circulatory support beyond 14 days.

While our findings are promising for the consideration of the Impella 5.5® in acute cardiogenic shock protocols, our study did have several limitations as single-center, retrospective review. Our sample bias may limit extrapolation of our experience to the general population in that our cohort was overwhelmingly male gender (85.7% male versus 14.3% female) and identified as non-Hispanic white (75%). This may represent gender bias and is consistent with other reported studies evaluating patient selection for mechanical circulatory support. Those studies suggest that women are more likely to be diagnosed later with end-stage heart failure, transferred at a more critical state, and have overall worse outcomes after LVAD implantation than their male counterparts. In addition, our institution did not utilize the Impella 5.5® for any female who had an acute myocardial infarction. The estimated proportion of females out of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the state of New Jersey is 42%. This can be assumed to also be representative of our institution as we are a large regional tertiary care center in New Jersey. This gender bias may be a result of under-recognition of heart failure and acute myocardial infarction in our female community as their presentation often differs from their male counterparts and is independently associated with a higher in-hospital mortality. This experience brings about the opportunity for our institution to investigate educational opportunities for the correction of this gender gap in care in our community and our own practice. Second, our implanted patient population was majorly non-Hispanic white (75%) with underrepresentation of non-Hispanic African Americans (8%) and Hispanic populations (4%). Published population studies have shown the incidence of heart failure is more evenly distributed among different ethnic groups with proposed incidences being 39% for non-Hispanic white, 29% for non-Hispanic African American, and 23% Hispanic. Our study highlights a disparity among racial groups which may be reflective of proposed socioeconomic inequalities in the treatment of heart failure.

### Imaging of cardiac support devices [^113NR3RC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) often have multiple support lines and devices that need routine imaging evaluation by radiologists. In patients with cardiogenic shock or depressed cardiac function, mechanical circulation support devices are used in combination with medical therapies to improve patient outcomes and sometimes can stabilize patients for surgical intervention. This article discusses some of the more commonly encountered mechanical circulation devices seen in ICU patients, including intra-aortic balloon pumps, Impella devices, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulas, and ventricular assist devices. Normal appearance and commonly encountered device-related complications that can be diagnosed on imaging are reviewed.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^113dKAAX]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Impella axial flow pumps — peri-implant selection and placement: Impella CP, 5, or 5.5 can be considered for adult patients with CS, and size can be guided by a calculated deliverable cardiac index of > 2.2 L/min/m^2; placement should be performed with the use of imaging/monitoring (fluoroscopy and/or TEE) to confirm no interaction with mitral valve apparatus or endocardial suction. Contraindications to Impella implantation include moderate to severe aortic insufficiency, severe aortic stenosis, mechanical aortic valve, aortic dissection, myxomatous MV, LV thrombus, and LVOT narrowing/obstruction; relative contraindications include access vessel diameter of < 6 mm, presence of heavy calcifications, obstruction or dissection, preexistent extremity ischemia related to implant site, prior open cannulations or surgical access/scar of unknown procedure, and active insertion site infection.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Medium credibility.

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) — hemodynamic support and myocardial effects are described as follows: V-A ECMO provides systemic circulatory support with flows sometimes exceeding 6 L/min depending on cannula sizes, yet V-A ECMO alone may not significantly reduce ventricular wall stress and may require that the LV is vented or unloaded by concomitant intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or Impella; metabolic derangement and deleterious systemic effects of cardiogenic shock can often be corrected within hours of initiation of ECMO.

### Impella RP in the treatment of right ventricular failure: what we know and where we Go [^115YyL85]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support devices for the treatment of acute right ventricular failure represent crucial tools for clinical practice. Right ventricular failure presents specific treatment issues, and dedicated percutaneous devices are less in number compared to the left ventricle. Current data and insights on mechanical circulatory support for the right ventricle come mostly from the context of cardiac surgery, predominantly the setting of acute right ventricular failure after left ventricular assist device implantation. The Impella RP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) is a minimally invasive temporary device that has gained application for the percutaneous treatment of right ventricular failure with positive clinical results. Even though treatment indications are clear, technical and management issues still are relevant because of the limited scientific data available. Appropriate positioning and repositioning, interaction with right ventricular valvular apparatus, anticoagulation management, weaning, and patient mobilization are examples of the open challenges. In line with the positive initial experience with this device, future research efforts should be focused on the improvement of device limitations and on providing additional data that might drive optimal clinical management.

### Scrutinizing mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: have we jumped the gun? [^113rksXi]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing therapeutic options and disposable resources, cardiogenic shock (CS) remains a formidable condition with high mortality. Today, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and microaxial flow devices (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, USA) are established forms of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in CS, with increasing application over the years. Despite this trend, incorporation into current ESC (Class IIa, evidence C) and AHA/ACC (Class IIa, evidence B-NR) guidelines is based nearly exclusively on observational results. Despite these recommendations and increasing application, current evidence from randomized controlled trials has not provided clear mortality benefit. Thus, reflection on current evidence is hereby justified.

Post-cardiotomy shock (PCS) and Impella support — In the RECOVER I study of patients having difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, an Impella 5.0 was placed in 16 patients; fifteen were successfully supported, with 30-day survival of 94%, but enthusiasm regarding this outcome must be colored by the low level of inotropic support required before Impella placement. In acutely ischemic medical patients, the 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Impella with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) found no difference between the therapies.

Axial flow pumps (Impella) postimplant monitoring and imaging — Elevated arterial pressure can result in reduction of effective pump flows and should be reduced appropriately. For invasive monitoring, arterial line for accurate blood pressure monitoring, PAC for hemodynamic measurements, and urinary catheter for close urine output monitoring are recommended. Low LV filling pressure (< 20 mm Hg) will result in "Impella position unknown" alarm. Echocardiography guidance includes use of transthoracic echo to confirm location of inflow and outflow cages at initial insertion, any catheter damages, any patient movements, or any alarms of the pump system, and during device exchange TEE can be used to visualize pump during exchange in operating room setting if fluoroscopy not available. Medical management includes start with purge solution of D5W with heparin.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^114Xcpxz]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shock — mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS): There are no large randomized trials to date evaluating the use of MCS devices among OHCA patients with shock. The DanGer Shock trial is being evaluated whereby 360 patients will be randomized to percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow plus conventional therapy, while in IMPRESS, 48 patients, (92% with cardiac arrest prior to randomization) were randomly assigned to Impella CP versus intra-aortic balloon pump, and treatment with Impella CP did not reduce mortality compared to IABP at 30 days. The use of MCS, specifically Impella, has rapidly been increasing among patients undergoing PCI with limited evidence of efficacy and possible increase in adverse events. For refractory OHCA, the role of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is of research interest; single centers with the necessary resources and regimented protocols have demonstrated benefit, ongoing randomized trials aim to determine benefit in carefully selected OHCA patients, and whether this strategy is generalizable outside dedicated centers has not been demonstrated. Institutions need to implement appropriate pathways and transfer protocols to hospitals with adequate resources for deteriorating patients.

### Echocardiographic guidance for placement and management of the impella 5.5 microaxial flow left ventricular assist device [^114XhXZK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The Impella 5.5 (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) is the newest iteration of temporary left-ventricular assist devices in the Impella family of devices used for cardiogenic shock. While general guidelines for implantation of mechanical circulatory support devices are available, the authors aim to provide specific and detailed guidance for the Impella 5.5 for the practical application of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography during placement and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography for device monitoring and management. Transesophageal echocardiography is paramount for preimplantation assessment of the right and left ventricles, possible shunt physiology, and valvular pathology. Its use is also helpful in ensuring appropriate device placement, initiating and modifying device settings, troubleshooting device placement, and diagnosing and managing complications.

METHODS

Data Availability

The data sets analyzed during the current study are not publicly available owing to contracts with the hospitals providing the data to the database.

Design and Ethical Statement

This was a retrospective cohort study using an inpatient administrative database, and the study conformed to RECORD (Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data) guidelines. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of The University of Tokyo (approval number, 3501‐(5); May 19, 2021). Because the data were anonymous, the institutional review board waived the requirement for informed consent.

Data Source

We used the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database, which contained administrative claims data and discharge abstracts from > 1500 acute care hospitals and covers ≈90% of all tertiary emergency hospitals in Japan. The database includes the following patient‐level data for all hospitalizations: age, sex, diagnoses (main diagnosis, admission‐precipitating diagnosis, most resource‐consuming diagnosis, second‐most resource‐consuming diagnosis, comorbidities present at admission, and complications arising after admission) recorded with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) codes, daily procedures recorded using Japanese medical procedure codes, daily drug administration, and discharge status. A previous validation study showed that the specificity of the recorded diagnoses in the database exceeded 96%, the sensitivity of the diagnoses ranged from 50% to 80%, and the specificity and sensitivity of the procedures both exceeded 90%.

Study Population

We identified all patients who received ECMO during hospitalization from September 28, 2016, to March 31, 2022. September 28, 2016, was the date when the Impella was approved for reimbursement under the national health insurance in Japan. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those who had received neither an Impella nor an IABP within 2 days before or after the ECMO initiation, and those with aortic disease as a primary diagnosis on admission. All patients were followed up until they died or were discharged from the hospital.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices in cardiovascular care are outlined, noting that historically the intra-aortic balloon pump was the only device available but that newer options have entered clinical practice, including axial flow pumps (Impella), left atrial to femoral artery bypass pumps (TandemHeart), and devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The statement emphasizes that these devices differ in hemodynamic effects, insertion, monitoring, and clinical applicability, and it reviews physiologic impact and use in specific clinical situations such as high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, and acute decompensated heart failure. It also addresses specialized right-sided support and pediatric populations and reviews clinical utility alongside American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines.

### Clinical management of the impella 5.5 pump [^112zddf5]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Impella 5.5 (Abiomed, USA) is a catheter-based micro-axial flow pump that has emerged as a vital tool in managing patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Delivering up to 5.5 L/min of flow, it enables full left ventricular (LV) support with beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic effects. Its unique advantages include high-flow, antegrade circulatory support with the potential for prolonged usage, making it suitable for bridging to recovery or heart replacement therapies. This manuscript provides a comprehensive, structured guide for the clinical management of patients supported with the Impella 5.5. It outlines best practices for patient selection, surgical implantation techniques-most commonly via the axillary artery-perioperative management, anticoagulation strategies, and postoperative monitoring. Special emphasis is placed on complication management, including bleeding, hemolysis, right ventricular dysfunction, stroke, aortic valve injury, and vascular complications. Technologies like SmartAssist and Impella Connect are highlighted for their utility in real-time device monitoring and remote management. The manuscript also discusses a three-phase framework for recovery: hemodynamic stabilization, initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and structured weaning protocols. Considerations for transitioning patients to heart transplantation or durable LVADs, as well as explant techniques, are detailed. The importance of multidisciplinary coordination-including a mechanical circulatory support (MCS) coordinator-is emphasized to ensure optimal patient outcomes. By synthesizing available evidence and institutional experience, this guide aims to standardize Impella 5.5 management, reduce complications, and improve outcomes in critically ill patients with advanced heart failure or CS.

### Recommendations for multimodality imaging of patients with left ventricular assist devices and temporary mechanical support: updated recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113Lwo7k]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Ultrasound-enhancing agents (UEAs) in TMCS and ECMO — UEAs should not be withheld based on any diagnosis or comorbidity, and in patients on TMCS including IABPs, Impella devices, the TandemHeart, and right-sided percutaneous support devices, the use of UEAs is not contraindicated and should be used if needed to better assess LV function; however, there remains understandable caution for patients supported by ECMO because UEAs may potentially activate the protective integrated air bubble alarms in certain devices, which could trigger interventions to disable flow and could lead to a pump shutdown with resultant cessation of flow and/or oxygenation and rapid perfusion compromise and/or desaturation and potentially cardiac and/or hypoxic arrest; although mitigation strategies exist, there remains a paucity of safety data to support widespread use of UEA in this patient population; like their use in patients supported by durable LVADs, UEAs may be considered in patients supported by TMCS including IABPs, Impella and TandemHeart devices, and percutaneous RV support devices; and UEAs should not be used in patients on ECMO devices, unless under the supervision of experienced perfusionists and clinicians due to possible interference with air bubble alarms and device function.

### Rationale and design of the ULYSS trial: a randomized multicenter evaluation of the efficacy of early impella CP implantation in acute coronary syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock [^1152bqC6]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Despite 20 years of improvement in acute coronary syndromes care, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains a major clinical challenge with a stable incidence and mortality. While intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) did not meet its expectations, percutaneous mechanical circulatory supports (pMCS) with higher hemodynamic support, large availability and quick implementation may improve AMICS prognosis by enabling early hemodynamic stabilization and unloading. Both interventional and observational studies suggested a clinical benefit in selected patients of the IMPELLA Ⓡ CP device within in a well-defined therapeutic strategy. While promising, these preliminary results are challenged by others suggesting a higher rate of complications and possible poorer outcome. Given these conflicting data and its high cost, a randomized clinical trial is warranted to delineate the benefits and risks of this new therapeutic strategy.

Design

The ULYSS trial is a prospective randomized open label, 2 parallel multicenter clinical trial that plans to enroll patients with AMICS for whom an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is intended. Patients will be randomized to an experimental therapeutic strategy with pre-PCI implantation of an IMPELLA Ⓡ CP device on top of standard medical therapy or to a control group undergoing PCI and standard medical therapy. The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of this experimental strategy by a composite end point of death, need to escalate to ECMO, long-term left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation at 1 month. Among secondary objectives 1-year efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness will be assessed.

Right-sided support for right ventricular failure (RVF) — device options and cannulation considerations note that RVF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, RV stroke work requires one-sixth the energy expenditure of the LV, and right ventricular support using two venous cannulas and ECMO or a TandemHeart centrifugal pump providing flow from the right atrium to main pulmonary artery has been reported; right internal jugular venous cannulation is particularly useful when the distance from the femoral vein to the fifth intercostal space exceeds 58 cm or if femoral venous access is limited, TandemHeart is not FDA-approved for use as an RVD, and the Impella RP is undergoing evaluation with a potential advantage of needing only a single venous access site.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and left ventricular unloading: what is the evidence? [^113LLgyc]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence of the Benefits of LV Unloading

Table 2 includes a summary of several relevant publications, including limited single-center analyses, multi-center studies, and extensive meta-analyses, that specifically addressed the occurrence of LV distension-related events and the effects of LV unloading in patients supported by V-A ECMO. From these studies, the need for and the benefits of LV unloading, particularly if applied early, appear concrete and relevant. Most studies identified advantages of LV decompression during V-A ECMO with increased rates of weaning from ECMO, early survival, and bridging to more advanced therapies. It is worth mentioning, however, that no randomized trials of LV unloading have been published, and patients selected for LV unloading and studied in retrospective analyses were likely at high risk. Furthermore, several different modalities were used for LV unloading in the available studies. Modalities were often mixed within each study and included IABP, Impella, direct LV cannulation, and left atrial venting. Each approach has unique benefits and shortcomings.

### Evaluating the learning curve in the prospective randomized clinical trial of hemodynamic support with impella 2.5 versus intra-aortic balloon pump in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention: a prespecified subanalysis of the PROTECT II study [^114RhFFh]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of new medical devices may be accompanied by a learning curve.

Methods

To evaluate the impact of the device learning curve on the outcomes of PROTECT II trial, comparing Impella 2.5 versus the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, we report on a prespecified analysis, excluding the first Impella 2.5 and IABP patients at each site.

Results

A total of 448 patients were enrolled at 74 sites. Among these, 58 patients were the first to receive Impella 2.5 at their site, 62 were the first to receive IABP. A trend toward higher major adverse events (MAEs) at 30 days was observed for the subgroup of first versus remaining Impella 2.5 patients: 44.8% versus 31.7%, P = .072. MAE rates for the first and remaining IABP patients were similar at 30 days. After exclusion of the first patient in each group, MAE rates for Impella 2.5 and IABP were 31.7% versus 40.0% (P = .119) at 30 days and 38.0% versus 50.0% (P = .029) at 90 days.

Conclusions

Significantly lower 90-day MAE rates were observed with the use of Impella 2.5 compared to the use of IABP after excluding the first patient per group at each site. This prespecified analysis suggests a learning curve associated with initial introduction of the Impella 2.5. Clinical trials should better address the training aspect of new devices, especially when compared with more established devices.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^116BoCeb]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Impella mechanical cardiac injuries and pump stoppage: Sudden changes in hemodynamics should warrant echo imaging to assess presence of AI, position of inflow and outflow cages, functional MS or MR owing to injury or obstruction, and even ventricular puncture. Recommendation on pump stoppage states this is usually owing to kinking or obstruction from thrombus or other inserted material; if no kink is seen on chest radiograph or fluoroscopy, removal of the device and possible replacement may be needed, and usually this requires another vascular access to be obtained although there have been anecdotal reports creating methods with large bore sheaths to exchange at the same site. Loss of sensor signal can occur, especially with traumatic insertion, or prolonged support, and monitoring motor current and patient parameters for change in clinical status can continue without pump replacement. The decision to perform chest compressions should be based on standard criteria; if compressions are indicated, consider dropping to P2 speed during manual compressions, and if ROSC occurs, resume prior speed and confirm location in LV via echo; if DCCV needed, avoid touching Impella system at time of shock.

### ECMO, VAD, impella, and IABP: primer on mechanical circulatory support devices [^112njHPj]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular and interventional physicians are routinely caring for some of the sickest patients in the hospital, including those with cardiopulmonary collapse. A foundational comprehension of mechanical circulatory devices is necessary in these situations. Within this article, we will review the indications, procedural steps, management, clinical follow up, and outcomes of 4 types of mechanical circulatory support devices: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventricular assist devices (VAD), Impella, and intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP). ECMO is a large-bore cannulation system serving patients in respiratory and/or combination of cardiorespiratory collapse. It requires constant monitoring and adjustment with a wide range of benefits in appropriately selected patients in the hospital. VADs are surgically-implanted devices for more long-term ventricular support, often extending the survival of end-stage heart failure or bridging to transplant. Impella and IABPs, by comparison, are smaller intravascular devices that aid in short-term ventricular off-loading and improve perfusion. They provide hemodynamic stabilization in the setting of acute cardiac insult or surgery, prior to either organ recovery or transition to more definitive therapy. All of these devices come with unique considerations and potential complications. This article will serve as a guide in evaluating patients for device candidacy, procedural placement, troubleshooting, management in the perioperative setting, complication surveillance, and clinical outcomes/follow-up.

### Characteristics and outcomes of older patients undergoing protected percutaneous coronary intervention with impella [^112WJRnZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

An aging population coupled with an increasing prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), has resulted in the increasing use of revascularization in older patients that can be safely performed. Despite the higher risk profile of older patients, characterized by multiple comorbidities, frailty, and extensive CAD, older patients undergoing high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (HRPCI) may derive equal or even greater benefit when compared with younger patients. However, high risk features combined with sparse clinical outcomes data may lead to underuse of both diagnostic testing for and treatment of CAD in older patients. Greater disparities may occur when older patients present with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function and complex CAD.

Due to the extensive clinical and anatomical risk features, operators have to rely on a safety net to ensure hemodynamic stability. Current guidelines support the use of an Impella percutaneous LV assist device in selected patients undergoing HRPCI. The randomized PROTECT II (Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial of Hemodynamic Support With Impella 2.5 Versus Intra‐Aortic Balloon Pump in Patients Undergoing High‐Risk Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial, which investigated percutaneous LV assist devices in complex coronary scenarios and reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF), had to be stopped early and narrowly failed to show a clinical benefit as compared with intra‐aortic balloon pump at the primary end point at 30 days in the intention‐to‐treat population. However, a prespecified analysis for the primary outcome at 90 days reached significant improvement in clinical outcomes in the per protocol analysis, leading to Food and Drug Administration approval for the Impella mechanical support device.

There is little evidence on the safety and efficacy of Impella‐supported HRPCI in older patients. This uncertainty may hinder interventional cardiologists from using percutaneous LV assist devices for HRPCI in such patients. The PROTECT III (Prospective, Multi‐Center, Randomized Controlled Trial of the IMPELLA RECOVER LP 2.5 System Versus Intra Aortic Balloon Pump in Patients Undergoing Non Emergent High Risk Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial is a Food and Drug Administration audited, prospective, multicenter, observational study that assessed outcomes of patients with complex CAD and severely depressed LV systolic function undergoing Impella‐supported HRPCI. The PROTECT III trial demonstrated improved completeness of revascularization and outcomes with the use of contemporary Impella‐supported HRPCI when compared with the previous PROTECT II study.

The aim of this study was to assess outcomes of older patients undergoing Impella‐supported HRPCI in the contemporary PROTECT III study.

### A single healthcare experience with impella RP [^113KhBP7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To understand the predictors of survival and indications for Impella RP in a single healthcare experience.

Background

The Impella RP can be used to temporarily support patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement or myocardial infarction (MI). However, recent postmarket approval data have raised concerns of higher than expected mortality with this device.

Methods

A retrospective chart review and analysis of all patients that underwent Impella RP placement in the Emory Healthcare system between January 2016 and December 2018 were performed. Patients were classified according to the indication.

Results

A total of 39 patients underwent Impella RP placement. Six patients were post-LVAD, 9 were implanted for massive pulmonary embolism with persistent shock, 8 for postcardiac surgery RV failure (non-LVAD), 11 for RV failure post-MI, and 5 for new or worsening nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The worst survival was noted in MI-related cardiogenic shock group and in patients who presented with cardiac arrest (3/12). All observed deaths were due to persistent refractory shock. There was no device related death. Survival improved during the last year of experience compared to the first 2years.

Conclusion

This study supports the selective use of the Impella RP, with a higher than national reported survival rate (49% vs. 28.6%). Indication appears to be an important factor determining survival.

### Effectiveness of an impella versus intra-aortic balloon pump in patients who received extracorporeal membrane Oxygenation [^115RqozF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides strong hemodynamic support to patients with cardiogenic shock through retrograde aortic blood flow in addition to oxygenation; however, even the latest evidence does not support a survival benefit with the routine use of ECMO in patients with cardiogenic shock. Potential reasons may include bleeding complications, peripheral vascular ischemia, pulmonary edema, and myocardial ischemia induced by an increased left ventricular (LV) afterload due to a strong retrograde aortic blood flow.

Previous studies have suggested that LV unloading with an intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) or percutaneous ventricular assist device (Impella, Abiomed) in combination with ECMO (ECMO+IABP or ECPella) is associated with a lower mortality. Those studies primarily focused on the effectiveness of LV unloading with an IABP or Impella, using patients who received ECMO alone as controls. The IABP reduces the LV afterload and provides indirect LV unloading through a negative systolic pressure in the descending aorta, whereas the Impella can directly decrease the LV overload and restore the pulmonary flow in patients with ECMO who present with severe LV dysfunction. No randomized controlled trial has compared the outcomes of using the Impella versus IABP in combination with ECMO. A recent meta‐analysis of 7 small‐scale observational studies showed no survival benefit of ECPella compared with ECMO+IABP; however, those studies had a high heterogeneity, and the results of the meta‐analysis were underpowered to assess the comparative effectiveness. It remains unclear whether differences in the device characteristics between the IABP and Impella affect the clinical outcomes in patients with ECMO who require LV unloading. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an Impella versus IABP on in‐hospital mortality and other clinical outcomes, using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan.

### Recommendations for multimodality imaging of patients with left ventricular assist devices and temporary mechanical support: updated recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^115suCgj]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) afterload effects and left ventricular (LV) venting strategies — potential benefits and options — are summarized as follows: Initiation of VA ECMO and pressurized blood return into the aorta may increase LV afterload, which can lead to LV distension, pulmonary congestion and edema, LV blood stasis and thrombus formation, myocardial ischemia, and delayed myocardial recovery. Initiating LV venting, especially early, can result in more successful weaning from VA ECMO and reduction in short-term mortality. LV venting may be performed by atrial septostomy or percutaneous or direct surgical cannulation of the left atrium (LA), LV, or pulmonary artery (PA). Common unloading strategies include the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and percutaneously placed Impella catheter, and the combination of Impella with VA ECMO (ECPELLA) has resulted in improved outcomes; echocardiographic views considerations and a proposed workflow before, during, and after percutaneous LV and RV temporary mechanical circulatory support (TMCS) are provided in Appendices Tables 2 and 3.

### Timing of impella implantation and outcomes in cardiogenic shock or high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization [^114TL2ef]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, the short‐term percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device, Impella® pump (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA), is increasingly used in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (HR‐PCI). Hemodynamic support with Impella increases cardiac output, improves end‐organ perfusion, and unloads the left ventricle, thus reducing myocardial oxygen demand, decreasing ventricular filling pressures and increasing coronary perfusion pressure. Following studies advocating safety and suggesting efficacy, at least in a complex PCI setting, the Impella pumps received FDA approval for use in HR‐PCI and CS in 2015 and 2016, respectively. However, recent real‐world observational studies report higher rates of adverse events and costs with Impella. Of note, the interpretation of these analysis is likely hampered by the uneven distribution of clinically relevant variables, heterogeneity of clinical indications, type and timing of hemodynamic support in relation to patient's clinical status at presentation and type of revascularization. Hence, identification of optimal timing of Impella implantation in specific clinical settings is of utmost clinical relevance. Therefore, we analyzed the temporality interplay between Impella insertion and PCI on all‐cause death and composite of mortality, re‐hospitalization for heart failure (HF), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) at 1 year in CS and HR‐PCI patients included in the IMPella Mechanical Circulatory Support Device in Italy (IMP‐IT) Registry.

Impella for postcardiotomy shock — Percutaneous or surgically implanted axial‑flow devices have emerged for cardiogenic shock and, unlike the IABP, these devices drastically reduce LV end‑diastolic pressure and volume and may be better poised to support systemic perfusion while allowing the heart to recover; Engström and colleagues reported on 46 patients with PCS treated with the Impella 5.0 at 3 European centers, roughly half having received an IABP before Impella placement, with overall survival of 48% at 30 days; another series reported use of the Impella 5.0/Impella LD in 29 patients with 40% having isolated CABG.

Postcardiotomy shock (PCS) and temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) — For PCS with inability to separate from cardiopulmonary bypass or requirement for high‑dose inotropic therapy, MCS should be considered; intra‑aortic balloon pump (IABP) use has been considered first‑line therapy for both medical shock and PCS and, even if insufficient to reverse cardiogenic shock, its usefulness in conjunction with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) argues for it as the initial mode of support, though the data do not support its use as an adjunct to an Impella device; historically, mortality with IABP was roughly 50% when used in PCS, and in 4550 patients operated on between 2004 and 2008, 5% required an intraoperative or postoperative IABP with overall mortality of 37%, while in predominantly right‑sided failure IABP increased cardiac index by 50% with associated mortality of 31%.

Right ventricular assist devices (RVAD) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for perioperative right heart failure (RHF) — timing, risks, and device specifics are noted as follows: "Decisions regarding implantation of temporary RVAD systems or moving to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be made expeditiously either in the operating room at time of LVAD implant, or as soon as it becomes evident that non mechanical approaches are failing", yet "implantation of an RVAD at time of the LVAD implant is associated with approximately 4-fold increase in mortality". The Impella RP "provides up to 4 liter/min of flow" with "encouraging outcomes" in "the 18 patient LVAD cohort", while the Protek Duo cannula "can be placed percutaneously in the right internal jugular vein" and is "attached to an extracorporeal circulatory pump, allowing full patient mobilization and percutaneous removal". In bridge-to-transplant use, "patient priority for transplant becomes high, facilitating timely transplantation in critically ill patients".

Mechanical circulatory support using Impella for high risk PCI is associated with better procedural and hemodynamic outcome compared with IABP although mortality benefit has been elusive. Limited evidence is available to study the effectiveness and safety of mechanical circulatory support in high risk PCI patients and much of it is confounded by underpowered and heterogeneous sample sizes. Lack of randomized trials studying contemporary percutaneous left ventricular assist devices is attributed to difficulty in randomizing high risk patients into trials of hemodynamic support.

### Impella versus IABP in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock [^1158yGQj]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is one of the largest historical cohorts investigating the benefit of haemodynamic support with Impella versus IABP in patients with severe AMICS.

The following findings emerged from our study. First, compared with IABP, treatment with Impella significantly improves parameters of shock severity and LVEF. Second, at 30 days, there is no significant benefit in all-cause mortality compared with IABP. Third, there is no significant increase in rates of stroke, reinfarction and TVR but treatment with Impella was associated with a significantly higher number of transfused erythrocytes concentrates due to bleeding complications.

AMICS is a complex disease, still associated with a mortality of 40%–75% despite early revascularisation. Impella has been frequently used in this clinical setting due to its feasibility and safety in emergency conditions and the benefits of ventricular unloading, supported from preclinical and clinical data. Superior haemodynamic support provided by Impella explains the significant reduction of lactate levels and SAPS II and the lower inotropic scores observed in our study. However, the CPI, length of ICU stay, the rate of mechanical ventilation and that of RRT were not different from patients treated with IABP. The onset of multiorgan failure due to SIRS, occurring in 11% of patients receiving Impella versus 5.5% of those receiving IABP, might have obscured the beneficial effects provided by the latter. The results of our study are in line with those of the Impella versus Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock trial, a metanalysis of existing RCTs, and a recent multicentre retrospective registry, all demonstrating the lack of benefit of Impella in reducing 30 day mortality. These studies included patients presenting in different stages of shock severity, while to date, the profile of patients with AMICS who may profit from pMCS remains still unclear. In fact, a benefit in terms of reduction in 30-day mortality with Impella, as compared with standard medical therapy or IABP, has not been shown in any clinical setting and for any pMCS for that matter. AMICS is indeed a condition with broad severity of presentation. Approximately 50% of patients survive AMICS without pMCS, on the contrary, pMCS might be futile in others because of the advanced state of disease. Therefore, an accurate risk stratification early in this emergency setting can help guide further clinical decision and refine patient selection towards achieving a real benefit from pMCS devices. Previous studies suggested a protective effect exerted by Impella in 'lower risk' patients. According to the results of the recently published 'Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative', the rapid delivery of Impella was beneficial in patients presenting in a still responsive shock stage. The authors implemented a regional protocol based on rapid early delivery of pMCS within 90 min of shock onset and early discontinuation of inotropic and vasopressors, being able to show an improvement of mortality compared with institutional historical cohorts. In our study, we did not find a significant difference in 30-day mortality after stratifying the patients according to the IABP-SHOCK II risk score. In fact, the estimated mortality rate in the low-intermediate risk group was approximately 60%–70%, reflecting the bailout character of Impella use in these patients with poor a haemodynamic profile. Although in the Detroit study the cohort was highly preselected, the results of the study indicate that in 'lower-risk' patients, the benefits of early pMCS implantation merit further investigation in appropriately powered trials.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device selection considerations and choices between intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and Impella devices are described as follows: Multiple factors must be considered when choosing MCS including the hemodynamic condition of the patient, hemodynamic impact of the device, technical considerations including ease and rapidity of insertion, and the ultimate goals of support. In emergent situations (e.g. STEMI), IABP is often selected as the quickest and most familiar way to obtain some degree of hemodynamic stabilization, especially in the setting of AMI with pump failure, and the initial effects of the IABP on coronary blood flow may be particularly desirable. However, the IABP often requires concomitant pharmacologic support to maintain hemodynamics in those with pump failure, and recent data raise questions about the efficacy and safety of IABP support in this setting. Operators familiar with the Impella may elect to insert this device instead in such patients, and in experienced centers, insertion of an Impella 2.5 or CP device may be as rapid as an IABP; if hemodynamic compromise occurs despite appropriate medical management and/or IABP, one may consider more powerful hemodynamic support devices such as an axial or centrifugal flow pump, noting that use of these devices requires an experienced team and may not be possible under all circumstances.

Clinical perspective

The summary of our experience with Impella 5.5® can expand the overall understanding of use in order to achieve successful patient outcomes as well as provide support for the expansion of its FDA-approved use. In addition our experience highlights a bias in mechanical circulatory support against the female sex and minority groups which is under-recognized and not fully understood. We are hopeful that our experience can help improve outcomes with other centers in their comprehensive care for cardiogenic shock.

### Clinical outcomes among cardiogenic shock patients supported with high-capacity impella axial flow pumps: a report from the cardiogenic shock working group [^1119M2Vj]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Impella 5.0 and 5.5 pumps (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) are large-bore transvalvular micro-axial assist devices used in cardiogenic shock (CS) for patients requiring high-capacity flow. Despite their increasing use, real-world data regarding indications, rates of utilization and clinical outcomes with this therapy are limited. The objective of our study was to examine clinical profiles and outcomes of patients in a contemporary, real-world CS registry of patients who received an Impella 5.0/5.5 alone or in combination with other temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) devices.

Methods

The CS Working Group (CSWG) Registry includes patients from 34 US hospitals. For this analysis, data from patients who received an Impella 5.0/5.5 between 2020–2023 were analyzed. Use of Impella 5.0/5.5 with or without additional tMCS therapies, duration of support, adverse events and outcomes at hospital discharge were studied. Adverse events including stroke, limb ischemia, bleeding and hemolysis were not standardized by the registry but reported per individual CSWG Primary Investigator discretion. For those who survived, rates of native heart recovery (NHR) or heart replacement therapy (HRT) including heart transplant (HT), or durable ventricular assist device (VAD) were recorded. We also assessed outcomes based on shock etiology (acute myocardial infarction or MI-CS vs. heart failure-related CS or HF-CS).

Results

Among 6,205 patients, 754 received an Impella 5.0/5.5 (12.1%), including 210 MI-CS (27.8%) and 484 HF-CS (64.1%) patients. Impella 5.0/5.5 was used as the sole tMCS device in 32% of patients, while 68% of patients received a combination of tMCS devices. Impella cannulation sites were available for 524/754 (69.4%) of patients, with 93.5% axillary configuration. Survival to hospital discharge for those supported with an Impella 5.0/5.5 was 67%, with 20.4% NHR and 45.5% HRT. Compared to HF-CS, patients with MI-CS supported on Impella 5.0/5.5 had higher in-hospital mortality (45.2% vs 26.2%, p < 0.001) and were less likely to receive HRT (22.4% vs 56.6%, p < 0.001. For patients receiving a combination of tMCS during hospitalization, this was associated with higher rates of limb ischemia (9% vs. 3%, p < 0.01), bleeding (52% vs 33%, p < 0.01), and mortality (38% vs 25%; p < 0.001) compared to Impella 5.0/5.5 alone. Among Impella 5.0/5.5 recipients, the median duration of pump support was 12.9 days (IQR: 6.8–22.9) and longer in patients bridged to HRT (14 days; IQR: 7.7–28.4).

Conclusions

In this multi-center cohort of patients with CS, use of Impella 5.0/5.5 was associated with an overall survival of 67.1% and high rates of HRT. Lower adverse event rates were observed when Impella 5.0/5.5 was the sole support device used. Further study is required to determine whether a strategy of early Impella 5.0/5.5 use for CS improves survival.

Condensed Abstract

High capacity Impella heart pumps are capable of provide up to 5.5 liter/min of flow while upper body surgical placement allows for ambulation. Patients with advanced cardiogenic shock from acute myocardial infarction or heart failure requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support may benefit from upfront use of Impella 5.5 to improve overall survival, including native heart recovery or successful bridge to durable left ventricular assist device surgery or heart transplantation.

### Impella versus intra-aortic balloon pump for high-risk PCI: a propensity-adjusted large-scale claims dataset analysis [^1113QA87]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Impella was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for use during high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs); however, its safety and efficacy compared with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has not been evaluated in contemporary practice and remains debated. We aimed to compare postapproval outcomes and costs of Impella versus IABP support for high-risk PCI in real-world practice across hospitals in the United States. We identified patients from the Premier Healthcare Database undergoing nonemergent Impella- or IABP-supported high-risk PCI. We used propensity adjustment to control baseline, procedure, and post-PCI medical treatment differences between treatment groups. We included patients undergoing nonemergent single-PCI procedures with either Impella or IABP support and excluded patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock or requiring > 1 mechanical support devices during index hospitalization. Outcomes included in-hospital survival, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, stroke, bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury, index hospitalization length of stay, and costs. From April 2016 to June 2019, a total of 48,179 patients were treated with Impella or IABP mechanical circulatory support at 304 hospitals in the United States. Among these, we identified 2,156 patients undergoing nonemergent high-risk PCI treated with Impella (n = 1,447) or IABP (n = 709). After propensity adjustment, Impella use was associated with improved survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.36) and less MI (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46) and cardiogenic shock (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.74). Stroke, bleeding requiring transfusion, and acute kidney injury were similar between groups. In conclusion, this Premier Healthcare Database propensity-adjusted analysis, Impella use during nonemergent high-risk PCI was associated with improved survival and reduced in-hospital MI and cardiogenic shock compared with IABP.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and summary — consensus statements on percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS): Percutaneous MCS provides superior hemodynamic support compared to pharmacologic therapy; this is particularly apparent for the Impella and TandemHeart devices, and these devices should remain available clinically and be appropriately reimbursed. Patients in cardiogenic shock represent an extremely high risk group in whom mortality has remained high despite revascularization and pharmacologic therapies, and early placement of an appropriate MCS may be considered in those who fail to stabilize or show signs of improvement quickly after initial interventions. MCS may be considered for patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), such as those requiring multivessel, left main, or last patent conduit interventions, particularly if the patient is inoperable or has severely decreased ejection fraction or elevated cardiac filling pressures.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — circulatory/ventilatory support define Percutaneous MCS as use of percutaneously inserted devices and/or catheters intended to provide varying degrees of hemodynamic support to the left, right, or both ventricles temporarily as a bridge to recovery, decision, VAD implantation, or transplantation, with permissible values IABP, VA-ECMO, TandemHeart, Microaxial flow pump (eg, Impella), None, and Unknown. IABP is defined as an intra-aortic balloon pump that increases myocardial oxygen perfusion while at the same time increasing cardiac output. VA-ECMO is defined as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with a venous cannula usually placed in the right or left common femoral vein for extraction and an arterial cannula usually placed into the right or left femoral artery for infusion, with an oxygenator between the extraction and infusion cannulae. TandemHeart provides ventricular support via a left atrial-to-femoral artery bypass system with a transseptal cannula, arterial cannula, and a centrifugal blood pump, where inflow aspirates oxygenated blood from the left atrium and blood is then pumped into the femoral artery. A microaxial flow pump provides temporary ventricular support by pulling blood from the left ventricle through an inlet area near the tip and expels blood into the ascending aorta.

### Combined risk stratification with patient characteristics and biomarkers in patients Treated with the impella for cardiogenic shock [^112gbZPR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a catastrophic condition characterized by low cardiac output, leading to organ malperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Despite the advances in therapeutic strategies in recent decades, in‐hospital mortality in patients with CS remains high, ranging from 40% to 50% in the current era. To achieve hemodynamic stability, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as intra‐aortic balloon pumping (IABP), venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and microaxial ventricular assist device (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA), may be indicated in patients with CS. The left‐sided Impella devices have a transvalvular pump with an inlet that resides within the left ventricle and an outlet in the aorta to provide continuous blood flow for supporting hemodynamics along with left ventricular unloading. Although the Impella may have a theoretical potential as a superior MCS device over others, clinical evidence has been lacking, and nonrandomized studies have counterintuitively indicated that the device may be related to higher risks of complications including major bleeding, stroke, and all‐cause mortality. Recently, a randomized control trial showed a survival benefit of the Impella use in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by CS, but the rates of major complications were substantially higher in those receiving the Impella devices. Given the high mortality and complication rates, early and accurate risk stratification is clinically relevant in patients with CS treated with the Impella. The risk score‐based approach may aid in clinical decision‐making and subsequent therapeutic interventions. In this context, biomarkers are useful for objective risk assessment. In the present study, we developed a risk‐predicting model using baseline characteristics and biomarkers in patients treated with the Impella devices in a setting of CS.

Pre–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) unloading in acute myocardial infarction–complicated CS — feasibility and timing: Observational data suggest that pre-PCI LV mechanical unloading may be associated with improved survival. Implantation can usually be achieved within 5–10 minutes and should not exceedingly delay standard care. Experience with the Impella device in stable patients with STEMI is limited, but preclinical studies have shown that the beneficial effect of acute LV unloading could be seen only when it is initiated 30 minutes before reperfusion but not within 15 minutes or after reperfusion.

Impella 2.5 for cardiogenic shock and elective HR-PCI — key findings: In a randomized study of 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, early increases in cardiac index were greater with Impella (+0.49 L/min m2) vs. +0.11 L/min/m2; p = 0.02), and 30-day mortality was high 46%) and not different between the two groups. In a large observational HR-PCI series of high-risk patients, procedural success was high with a 90% success rate with multi-vessel revascularization and 8% rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events, and survival was 91% and 88% at 6 and 12 months, respectively.

### Complications leading to death in patients supported by the impella 5.5: analysis from the FDA MAUDE database [^116vMjJT]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The Impella 5.5 is a temporary mechanical circulatory support device designed for use up to 14 days, and is typically used in patients with cardiogenic shock, severe heart failure, or end‐stage heart failure awaiting definitive treatments such as heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Since its introduction to the US in October 2019, clinical use of the Impella 5.5 has increased. Severe complications associated with the Impella 5.5, including death, have been reported in previous studies. However, the specific nature of these complications and the underlying factors contributing to fatal outcomes remain insufficiently explored.

### Mechanical assist devices for acute cardiogenic shock [^115Rrxid]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a state of critical end-organ hypoperfusion due to a primary cardiac disorder. For people with refractory CS despite maximal vasopressors, inotropic support and intra-aortic balloon pump, mortality approaches 100%. Mechanical assist devices provide mechanical circulatory support (MCS) which has the ability to maintain vital organ perfusion, to unload the failing ventricle thus reduce intracardiac filling pressures which reduces pulmonary congestion, myocardial wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. This has been hypothesised to allow time for myocardial recovery (bridge to recovery) or allow time to come to a decision as to whether the person is a candidate for a longer-term ventricular assist device (VAD) either as a bridge to heart transplantation or as a destination therapy with a long-term VAD.

Objectives

To assess whether mechanical assist devices improve survival in people with acute cardiogenic shock.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Web of Science Core Collection in November 2019. In addition, we searched three trials registers in August 2019. We scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials on people with acute CS comparing mechanical assist devices with best current intensive care management, including intra-aortic balloon pump and inotropic support.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed data collection and analysis according to the published protocol. Primary outcomes were survival to discharge, 30 days, 1 year and secondary outcomes included, quality of life, major adverse cardiovascular events (30 days/end of follow-up), dialysis-dependent (30 days/end of follow-up), length of hospital stay and length of intensive care unit stay and major adverse events. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes Summary statistics for the primary endpoints were risk ratios (RR), hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

The search identified five studies from 4534 original citations reviewed. Two studies included acute CS of all causes randomised to treatment using TandemHeart percutaneous VAD and three studies included people with CS secondary to acute myocardial infarction who were randomised to Impella CP or best medical management. Meta-analysis was performed only to assess the 30-day survival as there were insufficient data to perform any further meta-analyses. The results from the five studies with 162 participants showed mechanical assist devices may have little or no effect on 30-day survival (RR of 1.01 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35) but the evidence is very uncertain. Complications such as sepsis, thromboembolic phenomena, bleeding and major adverse cardiovascular events were not infrequent in both the MAD and control group across the studies, but these could not be pooled due to inconsistencies in adverse event definitions and reporting. We identified four randomised control trials assessing mechanical assist devices in acute CS that are currently ongoing.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from this review of a benefit from MCS in improving survival for people with acute CS. Further use of the technology, risk stratification and optimising the use protocols have been highlighted as potential reasons for lack of benefit and are being addressed in the current ongoing clinical trials.

### Timing of impella implantation and outcomes in cardiogenic shock or high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization [^117SaVF3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the role of the microaxial percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device (Impella® pump) implantation pre‐percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus during/after PCI in cardiogenic shock (CS) and high‐risk PCI populations.

Background

A better understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the Impella and the role of timing of this support initiation in specific clinical settings is of utmost clinical relevance.

Methods

A total of 365 patients treated with Impella 2.5/CP in the 17 centers of the IMP‐IT Registry were included. Through propensity‐score weighting (PSW) analysis, 1‐year clinical outcomes were assessed separately in CS and HR‐PCI patients, stratified by timing of Impella support.

Results

Pre‐procedural insertion was associated with an improvement in 1‐year survival in patients with CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with PCI (p = .04 before PSW, p = .009 after PSW) and HR‐PCI (p < .01 both before and after PSW). Among patients undergoing HR‐PCI, early Impella support was also associated with a lower rate of the composite of mortality, re‐hospitalization for heart failure, and need for left‐ventricular assist device/heart transplantation at 1‐year (p = .04 before PSW, p = .01 after PSW). Furthermore, Impella use during/after PCI was associated with an increased in‐hospital life‐threatening and severe bleeding among patients with AMI‐CS receiving PCI (7 vs. 16%, p = .1) and HR‐PCI (1 vs. 9%, p = .02).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested a survival benefit and reduced rates of major bleeding when a pre‐PCI Impella implantation instead of during‐after procedure was used in the setting of HR‐PCI and AMI‐CS.

### Improved clinical outcomes associated with the impella 5.5 compared to the impella 5.0 in contemporary cardiogenic shock and heart failure patients [^116JLiFM]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

A redesigned surgically implanted heart pump incorporates several design changes from the prior device generation, but no published comparative data demonstrate if these changes translate to improved outcomes. We retrospectively compared clinical characteristics and outcomes, drawn from an FDA-mandated QA database, for contemporary patients treated with the Impella 5.5 or Impella 5.0 for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS), cardiomyopathy, or postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS). A total of 1238 patients at 290 US sites were included for analysis. Patients receiving the Impella 5.5 had significantly higher survival through explant (i.e., successfully weaned or bridged to heart replacement therapy) than those receiving the Impella 5.0 in all 3 settings: AMICS (70.5% vs 56.8%; p = 0.005), cardiomyopathy (88.1% vs 76.9%; p = 0.001), and PCCS (76.1% vs 55.7%; p = 0.003). Duration of support was significantly longer for Impella 5.5 patients with AMICS (9.2 vs 6.1 days; p = 0.008) and cardiomyopathy (10.7 vs 8.1 days; p < 0.001).

### Predicting survival after impella implantation in patients with cardiogenic shock: the J-PVAD risk score [^114mrJV4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a fatal condition that causes end‐organ hypoperfusion and hypoxia due to low cardiac output, and is an indication for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) when refractory to drug therapy. Despite recent therapeutic advances in CS, the mortality rate remains high, especially in patients requiring MCS. However, even among cases treated with MCS, the prognosis differs substantially depending on multiple factors, including the MCS device used, age, the aetiology of CS, and the presence of multiple organ failure. Thus, to stratify the risk of mortality and determine the appropriate selection for MCS indication, many risk prediction models have been developed for patients requiring MCS. These models have been included in guidelines and are widely used in clinical practice.

Impella, a type of percutaneous ventricular assist device (PVAD), has recently emerged as a new option for temporary MCS in CS, in addition to the intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) and veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA‐ECMO). Some observational studies have reported that patients treated with VA‐ECMO and Impella concomitantly had better survival rates than those treated with VA‐ECMO alone. Additionally, the DanGer Shock trial demonstrated that the use of Impella in addition to standard therapy reduced the risk of all‐cause death at 180 days compared with standard therapy alone among patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction complicated by CS. These findings suggest that the prognostic profile of patients treated with Impella may differ from that of those not treated with this device. Consequently, extrapolating risk prediction models developed based on datasets of patients treated with other MCS devices for CS to patients requiring Impella lack theoretical validity and also have not been well validated. Moreover, valid risk prediction models for patients treated with Impella are lacking. Thus, developing a new risk prediction model for patients with CS requiring Impella is an urgent need in this field.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with prognosis in CS treated with Impella using a nationwide registry and to develop and validate an easily applicable prognostic model in clinical practice based on these factors.

Impella postimplant monitoring and complications management: Reported complications of Impella placement include vessel perforation, extensive bleeding at insertion site, rapid progression of cardiac failure or acute RV failure, and rare device complications such as ingestion of material into motor during insertion, device fracture, cardiac perforation, valvular damage or stroke have been documented and require unique and urgent interventions; sudden deterioration should prompt rapid evaluation for device malfunction or malposition. Postimplant recommendations include hemodynamic monitoring on Impella support in which diuretic therapy should be used to achieve PCWP of < 15 mm Hg and central venous pressure of < 12 mm Hg, with arterial line, PAC for hemodynamic measurements, and urinary catheter for close urine output monitoring recommended; very low purge pressure (< 200 mm Hg) will result in "Impella position unknown" alarm. Echocardiographic care includes using transthoracic echo to confirm location of inflow and outflow cages at initial insertion, with any attempted changes, movements, or alarms, and TEE can be used to visualize pump during exchange if fluoroscopy not available. Medical issues include starting with purge solution of D5W with heparin, and mechanical issues include that a flattened motor current can imply device out of position (both inflow and outflow seeing same pressure) or profound LV hypocontractility; elevations in purge pressures can suggest kinking or thrombus development; and sudden changes in flows, motor current or purge pressures can imply serious malposition or mechanical complication of device and warrant imaging via echo, chest radiograph, or chest CT scan.

Impella left-sided percutaneous mechanical circulatory support — use, durations, contraindications, and outcomes: For high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), Impella devices may be used for ≤ 6 hours temporary support. The Impella 2.5 and CP devices are approved for 4 or fewer days, and the Impella 5.0 for 10 days in cardiogenic shock (CS) arising within 48 hours of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), postcardiotomy, or acute left heart failure (HF) syndromes. Contraindications include left ventricular (LV) thrombus, a mechanical aortic valve, severe aortic stenosis, at least moderate aortic insufficiency, severe peripheral arterial disease, severe right HF, atrial or ventricular septal defect with potential right-to-left shunt worsening, LV rupture, and cardiac tamponade; additional considerations include coagulopathy, blood stream infections, and medical futility. Trials show hemodynamic improvement without survival benefit: in ISAR-SHOCK, cardiac index improved at 30 minutes versus intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in 26 AMI patients, but the 30-minute benefit was lost within 4 hours; in a cohort with 92% AMI+CS and recent cardiac arrest, Impella CP did not confer a survival advantage at 30 days or 6 months compared with IABP. The Impella 5.0 and 5.5 may reduce complications from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and can be used as bridge-to-bridge and bridge-to-decision options.

Right-sided devices (ProtekDuo and Impella RP) — device selection, positioning, and monitoring. ProtekDuo or Impella RP can be considered for acute RV failure. Use of imaging to ensure precise positioning and to prevent outflow graft kinking, twisting and obstruction is recommended. For Impella RP, monitor for suction events; if noted, the speed should be adapted to avoid cavitation/suction events, and for placement signal, motor current waveform, purge pressure (300–1100 mm Hg) and infusion rate. Device migration with daily imaging (chest radiography [CXR] or transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]) and waveforms and flows of the pump to identify migration of the pump are specified; echocardiography should be performed if movement of the device is suspected. An Impella device reposition can be attempted under echocardiographic guidance. With all right ventricular assist device (RVAD) devices in the absence of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), monitor the patient for pulmonary edema resulting from LV failure (RVAD flow should not exceed LV flow). Additional recommendations include that monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is recommended, the tip of the PAC should be placed opposite to the pump outflow, echocardiography can be used to optimize RVAD flow by simultaneously assessing biventricular function, compliance or diastolic function, and monitoring for an increase of tricuspid valve regurgitation of more than 1 grade on echocardiography should be performed.

### Management and outcome of patients supported with impella 5.0 for refractory cardiogenic shock [^1152YXed]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This retrospective, observational study reports that Impella 5.0 support indicated for refractory cardiogenic shock was associated with a low day-28 mortality rate and led to myocardial recovery, transplantation or long-term support in 70% of the implanted patients. Besides, some promising characteristics of Impella 5.0 support like fast weaning of inotropes, preservation of transpulmonary blood flow and optimal RV evaluation in the prospective of LVAD are suggested. Impella 5.0 seems a good mechanical assistance in the early phase of cardiogenic shock, when circulatory failure is not too critical. In acute ischemic conditions, it may protect against left ventricle remodeling, but further studies are needed to confirm long-term myocardial recovery and left ventricle function improvement.

### Impact of baseline cardiogenic shock severity on outcomes in patients treated with impella device [^116tLjar]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a fatal condition that begins with impaired cardiac function, leading to systemic hypoperfusion and resulting in hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and metabolic changes that progressively worsen without treatment. Despite therapeutic advances in drug and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices over the past 2 decades, the short‐term mortality rate in patients with CS remains largely unchanged and high, ranging between 30% and 60%. In CS management, the treatment effect varies according to the mixed pathogeneses, phenotypes, and clinical presentations, and consistent parameters used to accurately assess shock severity were lacking. Recent publications have reported that the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic responsiveness to comprehensive therapies depends on the patient profile.

Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA), a percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump, has recently emerged as a new device for temporary MCS in CS management, in addition to the intra‐aortic balloon pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA‐ECMO). Overall, retrospective data on Impella use in CS compared with standard therapy are heterogeneous. However, the DanGer Shock (Danish–German Cardiogenic Shock) trial demonstrated that Impella use in addition to standard therapy reduced the risk of all‐cause death at 180 days compared with standard therapy alone among patients with CS complicated with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Furthermore, a previous large‐scale study using propensity score matching demonstrated that patients treated with a combination therapy of VA‐ECMO and Impella had significantly lower mortality rates than those treated with VA‐ECMO alone. The feasibility of using the Impella in CS is expected to increase in the coming years.

### Impella versus IABP in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock [^112XaNmx]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains an important cause of death, despite early percutaneous coronary revascularisation. Recent data show that in these patients, in-hospital mortality reaches 66% and long-term mortality 80%.

In patients with AMICS, the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used for mechanical support for decades, but it was downgraded from the guideline recommendations after the IABP-SHOCK II trial failed to show any mortality benefit over medical therapy alone. Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) is a promising alternative for percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (pMCS) that has been utilised as a bridge to recovery. It consists of a miniaturised axial flow pump fitted onto a pigtail catheter, pumping blood from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta and providing a cardiac output of 2.5 L/min (Impella 2.5) and up to 4.0 L/min (Impella CP). It actively unloads the left ventricle reducing the stroke-work and myocardial oxygen consumption, thereby providing cardioprotection and robust haemodynamic support.

Two randomised controlled trials (RCT) and a metanalysis of RCTs investigated the benefit of Impella versus IABP, but they were highly underpowered to detect a mortality difference. Moreover, as noted from the investigators of those trials, RCTs in the setting of AMICS are extremely difficult to conduct. Therefore, the profile of patients who may profit from support with Impella still remains unclear.

The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of Impella compared with IABP in patients with AMICS in terms of improvement of parameters of shock severity and all-cause mortality at 30 days.

Device escalation and knowledge gaps — Operators must consider the advantages and disadvantages of initially selecting a device to achieve higher cardiac output early in a high-risk procedure or at the early stages of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) or shock; for those who continue to deteriorate despite intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, TandemHeart using the larger arterial outflow cannula, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or surgical cutdown for delivery of an Impella 5.0 should be considered, and in cardiogenic shock with mechanical complications the TandemHeart or Impella 5.0 offers the greatest cardiac output and hemodynamic support while surgical candidacy is evaluated; inotropes may still be required for RV function after left-sided support, patients with biventricular failure and/or impaired oxygenation may require ECMO or biventricular support with two different devices, and early MCS implantation before multiple vasopressors is theoretically attractive but requires testing in controlled trials; insertion of an Impella or TandemHeart device should permit completion of a revascularization procedure without hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion, reduce vasoconstriction more quickly, and achieve a greater likelihood of improved late survival, and such an approach is supported by recent guidelines; however, given limited prospective, randomized, multicenter data with MCS, recommendations must be tempered, effects on reducing left ventricular (LV) stroke work and myocardial oxygen demand in acute myocardial infarction are poorly understood, available clinical data do not support use to reduce infarct size and/or ischemic complications, more data are needed on subgroups that may benefit during high-risk PCI (HR-PCI), and a phase III, multicenter, three-arm study comparing outcomes with IABP, MCS or neither is noted.

### Timing of impella implantation and outcomes in cardiogenic shock or high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization [^112nv8qL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study based on IMP IT Registry ‐ the largest European national registry — to address the interplay between the timing of Impella support and 1‐year clinical outcomes in patients with HR‐PCI and CS indications. This real‐world analysis suggests: (a) Impella is frequently used prophylactically in HR‐PCI, while it is mostly implanted during/after the interventional procedure in CS; (b) there is a significant interplay between timing of Impella implantation and clinical outcomes as confirmed by a lower occurrence of in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality with prophylactic Impella use in case of PCI‐procedure; (c) pre‐PCI use of the Impella was safer and associated with lower in‐hospital life‐threatening and severe bleeding rates both in HR‐PCI and AMI‐CS patients receiving PCI.

4.1 Clinical role of Impella

The role of Impella has been recently questioned. Indeed, Impella has been shown to provide superior hemodynamic support than IABP both in CS and HR‐PCI settings and some studies have suggested its safety with a possible survival benefit and reduced MACE rate, at least in a complex PCI population. However, more recent analyses have failed to show a prognostic advantage of the Impella versus IABP, raising concerns in terms of higher rates of adverse events. Major caveats in the interpretation of these studies are the heterogeneity of the clinical indications, the type and timing of MCS support with respect to clinical status of the patient and the type of revascularization. Given the lack of adequately powered randomized trials, we used the national dataset of IMP‐IP Registry to assess the optimal timing of both 2.5 and CP devices implantation in CS and HR‐PCI on outcomes and identify best practice for management of patients with Impella support. Similar to previous studies based on registries, our study included patients with high clinical and anatomical complexity. Contrariwise, our analysis focused on the role of timing of Impella support and associated outcomes in two specific high‐risk clinical subsets of patients revascularized using PCI.

### Supported high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention with the impella 2.5 device the europella registry [^1175uw2W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

This retrospective multicenter registry evaluated the safety and feasibility of left ventricular (LV) support with the Impella 2.5 (Abiomed Europe GmbH, Aachen, Germany) during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Patients with complex or high-risk coronary lesions, such as last remaining vessel or left main lesions, are increasingly being treated with PCI. Because periprocedural hemodynamic compromise and complications might occur rapidly, many of these high-risk procedures are being performed with mechanical cardiac assistance, particularly in patients with poor LV function. The Impella 2.5, a percutaneous implantable LV assist device, might be a superior alternative to the traditionally used intra-aortic balloon pump.

Methods

The Europella registry included 144 consecutive patients who underwent a high-risk PCI. Safety and feasibility end points included incidence of 30-day adverse events and successful device function.

Results

Patients were older (62% > 70 years of age), 54% had an LV ejection fraction ≤ 30%, and the prevalence of comorbid conditions was high. Mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score was 8.2 (SD 3.4), and 43% of the patients were refused for coronary artery bypass grafting. A PCI was considered high-risk due to left main disease, last remaining vessel disease, multivessel coronary artery disease, and low LV function in 53%, 17%, 81%, and 35% of the cases, respectively. Mortality at 30 days was 5.5%. Rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding requiring transfusion/surgery, and vascular complications at 30 days were 0%, 0.7%, 6.2%, and 4.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

This large multicenter registry supports the safety, feasibility, and potential usefulness of hemodynamic support with Impella 2.5 in high-risk PCI.

Percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device mechanics — axial and centrifugal pumps, Impella, TandemHeart, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) — are contrasted by placement and hemodynamic effects, noting that effects of pump type on left ventricular (LV) unloading have not been clearly established, that Impella unloads directly from the LV while TandemHeart reduces LV preload via left atrial inflow, and that ECMO can increase LV after-load necessitating venting. To achieve device flow rates of 5 L/min, the TandemHeart requires venous and arterial cannulation with trans-septal puncture, whereas the Impella 5.0 pump requires surgical vascular access, and no patient-level data currently suggest a meaningful difference between unloading via the left atrium or the LV.

### Impella smartAssist technology: practical foundations and clinical management [^1156kqsQ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support device technology has undergone significant evolution with the introduction of the SmartAssist platform, enabling enhanced monitoring of patient-pump interactions. Continuous-flow pump dynamics and patient hemodynamics are closely interconnected, and pump performance depends on physiologic (eg, afterload, preload) and anatomic (eg, pump position, ventricle size) parameters. The SmartAssist platform readily provides an array of data, including measured and derived variables, to support clinical decision-making; however, these new features are often not well understood by providers. It is essential for clinicians managing temporary mechanical circulatory support devices to understand and correctly interpret platform data, ensuring proper device functioning and improving patient outcomes. This review aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the SmartAssist technology and to promote its correct interpretation and management by illustrative clinical scenarios.

### Impella RP for treatment of right ventricular shock: appropriate unloading never gets old [^117DoTXp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Rapid restoration of hemodynamics is key to successful shock management. The failing right ventricular (RV) is resilient and recovers if hemodynamics are supported while the underlying insulting cause is alleviated. Inotropic/vasopressor drugs constitute a "double-edged sword" that augment hemodynamics, but exacerbate myocardial and multiorgan injury. Impella RP mechanical support for RV shock stabilizes hemodynamics and is associated with favorable clinical outcomes.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of percutaneous left ventricular assist devices for high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions [^1158DmCK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

High-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often offered to patients with extensive coronary artery disease, decreased left ventricular function, and co-morbid conditions that increase surgical risk. In these settings, percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (PVADs) can be used for hemodynamic support. To assess the effects of PVAD use on mortality, myocardial infarction, and complication rates in patients undergoing high-risk PCI, we systematically searched the electronic databases, MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients that received hemodynamic support with PVADs for high-risk PCI. The primary outcome measures were 30-day all-cause mortality, 30-day myocardial infarction rates, periprocedural major bleeding, and vascular complications. We included 12 studies with 1,346 participants who underwent Impella 2.5 L device placement and 8 cohort studies with 205 patients that received TandemHeart device for high-risk PCI. Short-term mortality rates were 3.5% and 8% and major bleeding rates were 7.1% and 3.6% with Impella and TandemHeart, respectively. Both devices are associated with comparable periprocedural outcomes in patients undergoing high-risk PCI.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of right ventricular failure: a state of the art review of mechanical support devices [^113bzijz]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The function of the right ventricle (RV) is to drive the forward flow of blood to the pulmonary system for oxygenation before returning to the left ventricle. Due to the thin myocardium of the RV, its function is easily affected by decreased preload, contractile motion abnormalities, or increased afterload. While various etiologies can lead to changes in RV structure and function, sudden changes in RV afterload can cause acute RV failure which is associated with high mortality. Early detection and diagnosis of RV failure is imperative for guiding initial medical management. Echocardiographic findings of reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (< 1.7) and RV wall motion (RV S' < 10 cm/s) are quantitatively supportive of RV systolic dysfunction. Medical management commonly involves utilizing diuretics or fluids to optimize RV preload, while correcting the underlying insult to RV function. When medical management alone is insufficient, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be necessary. However, the utility of MCS for isolated RV failure remains poorly understood. This review outlines the differences in flow rates, effects on hemodynamics, and advantages/disadvantages of MCS devices such as intra-aortic balloon pump, Impella, centrifugal-flow right ventricular assist devices, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and includes a detailed review of the latest clinical trials and studies analyzing the effects of MCS devices in acute RV failure.

### Safety and efficacy of mechanical circulatory support with impella or intra-aortic balloon pump for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention and / or cardiogenic shock: insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115znEzr]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with Impella or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and/or for cardiogenic shock (CS) due to acute myocardial infarction. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Impella or IABP when compared with no MCS using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched through February 2020 for RCT evaluating efficacy of Impella vs. IABP vs. no MCS in patients undergoing high-risk PCI or CS. The primary efficacy outcome was 30day or in-hospital all-cause mortality whereas the primary safety outcomes were major bleeding and vascular complications.

Results

Our search identified nine RCTs enrolling a total of 1,996 patients with high-risk PCI and/or CS. There was no significant difference with Impella or IABP on all-cause mortality when compared with no MCS (Impella vs. no MCS; OR:0.82 [0.35–1.90], p = .65, IABP vs. no MCS; OR:0.77 [0.47–1.28], p = .31, I² = 18.1%). Impella significantly increased major bleeding compared with no MCS (Impella vs. no MCS; OR:7.01 [1.11–44.4], p = .038, I² = 19.2%). IABP did not increase the risk of major bleeding compared with no MCS (OR:1.27 [0.75–2.16], p = .38, I² = 19.2%) but increased vascular complication compared with no MCS (OR:1.92 [1.01–3.64], p = .045, I² = 1.5%).

Conclusions

Neither Impella nor IABP decreased all-cause short-term mortality when compared with no MCS for high-risk PCI and/or CS. Moreover, Impella increased major bleeding compared with no MCS.

### Use of impella heart pump for management of women with peripartum cardiogenic shock [^117A91eE]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous MCS devices are increasingly used in the treatment of CS. The Impella devices are transvalvular micro‐axial flow pumps that entrain blood from the LV and pump it into the aorta in series, thus unloading the LV. These devices are a valuable tool in the management of CS due to their ability to maintain vital organ perfusion, decrease LV wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption, thereby enhancing the likelihood of ventricular recovery. 6, 29 In fact, multiple studies have demonstrated that early initiation of Impella support within 90 minutes of CS onset was associated with higher survival. 30, 31, 32 An additional advantage of early Impella use in CS is the decrease in the use of inotropic agents, thus, reducing the effects of these cardiotoxic drugs. 33 In comparison to the growing evidence base of benefits of the Impella support in CS due to myocardial infarct, very few reports exist on the use of Impella in CS due to PPCM. In this study, the majority of women were diagnosed with PPCM post‐delivery with a mean LVEF of 14%. This group of women was previously shown to have a low likelihood of recovery. 34 In addition, most of the women in the present study were in CS and received mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Despite the critically ill nature of these women, > 85% survived to discharge and 1 in two women had recovery of their native heart function, demonstrating the potential of MCS with Impella for hemodynamic stabilization and as a bridge to recovery or implantation of a durable cardiac assist device in women with CS due to PPCM.

Published case reports also suggest the potential stabilization of patients with CS due to PPCM with VA‐ECMO. 35, 36 In spite of the success demonstrated with the use of VA ECMO, the benefit of this device needs to be carefully weighed against a high risk of complications including limb ischemia, stroke, acidosis, bleeding, thrombosis, infections, compartment syndrome resulting in muscle necrosis, lower limb ischemia that can lead to amputation, and Harlequin syndrome which may result in upper body and brain ischemia. 37, 38 Surgical or catheter‐based insertion of a reperfusion catheter is often necessary to prevent limb ischemia. In addition, concomitant LV unloading is often required during VA‐ECMO support due to an increase in LV afterload leading to LV distension and increased LV filling pressure. 39 In contrast to VA‐ECMO, a relatively low incidence of manageable adverse events was observed with the use of the Impella device in the 15 patients reported in this study.

### How would the authors treat their own temporary left ventricular failure with mechanical circulatory support? [^115MnFfw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 20 years, mechanical circulatory supports (MCS) have overturned completely the outcomes and the clinical recovery of patients with isolated acute left ventricle failure (iALVF). This usually occurs more frequently than right-sided heart failure or biventricular dysfunction, and it mainly is caused by acute myocardial infarction. The primary role of MCS is to restore the tissue metabolism to preserve the vital organs' function but, on the other hand, they also have to relieve the workload stress on the heart. In this way, they allow not only the heart to recover from the acute event, but MCS also can stabilize the patient toward cardiac transplantation. The short-term MCS devices currently used in clinical practice are the intraaortic balloon pump, the Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA), and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), but the choice of the right and tailored device for each patient, as well as the timing to use it, is actually one of the most debated topics of MCS management.

PROTECT 2 randomized trial — Impella 2.5 versus IABP in HR-PCI: The trial enrolled 452 symptomatic patients with complex coronary disease to IABP (n = 226) or Impella 2.5 (n = 226). The 30-day composite primary end point of 11 adverse events was not significantly different in the intent-to-treat population (Impella 35.1% vs. 40.1% IABP, p = 0.227), and the trial was stopped early for futility.

At 90 days, a trend toward decreased events was observed in the intent-to-treat population (40.6% Impella vs. 49.3% IABP, p = 0.066), with more marked differences in the per protocol population (40.0% Impella vs. 51.0% IABP, p = 0.023). A subsequent analysis redefining myocardial infarction showed lower events with Impella (composite event rate 37% vs. 49%, p = 0.014) and lower major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (22% vs. 31%, p = 0.034); Impella provided superior hemodynamic support in comparison with IABP.

IS (IMPELLA‐) PROTECTEDSUPERIOR TO UNPROTECTED?

Patients undergoing HRPCI are at risk of hypotension, decompensated heart failure, shock, and arrythmias that possibly lead to rapid hemodynamic deterioration or even death. In older patients, these risks may be even more outspoken. It thus seems intuitive to provide hemodynamic support during HRPCI, serving as a safety net in case of hemodynamic compromise. Importantly, BCIS‐1 (Balloon Pump Assisted Coronary Intervention Study) showed that routine intra‐aortic balloon placement did not reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at hospital discharge in patients undergoing HRPCI. Two years later, PROTECT II (Prospective, Multi‐Center, Randomized Controlled Trial of the IMPELLA RECOVER LP 2.5 System Versus Intra Aortic Balloon Pump in Patients Undergoing Non Emergent High Risk Percutaneous Coronary Intervention), which randomized patients with HRPCI to either intra‐aortic balloon– or Impella 2.5–protected HRPCI, was published. As the authors rightfully mention, the PROTECT II trial was stopped prematurely for futility. Nevertheless, the Impella 2.5 provided better hemodynamic support and received Food and Drug Administration approval based on the per‐protocol analysis for the prespecified primary outcome analysis at 90 days. These studies led to a weak recommendation in the 2021 US guidelines for coronary artery revascularization, which states that in select high‐risk patients, elective insertion of an appropriate hemodynamic support device may be reasonable to prevent hemodynamic compromise during HRPCI.

### Trends in veno-arterial extracorporeal life support with and without an impella or intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock [^112TpxDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Increased afterload during VA‐ECLS can cause increased LV pressure and decreased stroke volume. It is likely that increased wall stress can lead to additional myocardial ischemia, which has been hypothesized to delay myocardial recovery, increase pulmonary congestion, and predispose patients to arrythmias and pulmonary thrombi. Consequently, many LV venting/unloading strategies, including an Impella/IABP, respectively, have been used to offset this limitation of VA‐ECLS use. Although the premise of using such a strategy is physiologically promising, data on outcomes have been limited to small observational studies and a few registries. Use of a second MCS device for LV venting/unloading has demonstrated mortality benefit in observational studies compared with VA‐ECLS alone; however, randomized trials with VA‐ECLS and cardiogenic shock do not exist, and several trials exploring MCS devices in AMI have proven to be challenging. Although our present study is limited in determining whether an IABP or Impella were placed for the purpose of LV venting, it suggests that even in the absence of trial data and supporting guidelines, physicians are increasingly adopting a strategy of using a second MCS device. An Impella and IABP were most frequently used in the setting of CS complicating AMI, consistent with populations studied in the IABP‐SHOCK (Intraaortic Balloon Support for Myocardial Infarction with Cardiogenic Shock) and the IMPRESS (Impella Versus Intra‐Aortic Balloon Pump in Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock) trials. Although Impella did not demonstrate a mortality benefit and saw a modestly increased odds of in‐hospital mortality, in a sensitivity analysis, IABP use trended toward decreased odds of in‐hospital mortality in the present study. The variation in mortality results in our study and previous observational studies may be explained by the heterogeneity in the study population, but warrants further investigation.

### Percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump support in cardiology [^1135GFxz]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The Impella device (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA) is a percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump that is currently used for (1) cardiogenic shock, (2) left ventricular unloading (combination of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and Impella concept), (3) high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions, (4) ablation of ventricular tachycardia, and (5) treatment of right ventricular failure. Impella-assisted forward blood flow increased mean arterial pressure and cardiac output, peripheral tissue perfusion, and coronary blood flow in observational studies and some randomized trials. However, because of the need for large-bore femoral access (14 F for the commonly used Impella CP device) and anticoagulation, the incidences of bleeding and ischemic complications are as much as 44% and 18%, respectively. Hemolysis is reported in as many as 32% of patients and stroke in as many as 13%. Despite the rapidly growing use of the Impella device, there are still insufficient data on its effect on outcome and complications on the basis of large, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. The only 2 small and also underpowered randomized controlled trials in cardiogenic shock comparing Impella versus intra-aortic balloon pump did not show improved mortality. Several larger randomized controlled trials are currently recruiting patients or are in preparation in cardiogenic shock (DanGer Shock [Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock Trial; NCT01633502]), left ventricular unloading (DTU-STEMI [Door-To-Unload in ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction; NCT03947619], UNLOAD ECMO [Left Ventricular Unloading to Improve Outcome in Cardiogenic Shock Patients on VA-ECMO], and REVERSE [A Prospective Randomised Trial of Early LV Venting Using Impella CP for Recovery in Patients With Cardiogenic Shock Managed With VA ECMO; NCT03431467]) and high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PROTECT IV [Impella-Supported PCI in High-Risk Patients With Complex Coronary Artery Disease and Reduced Left Ventricular Function; NCT04763200]).

### Trends in veno-arterial extracorporeal life support with and without an impella or intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock [^115TvbfK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Mechanical circulatory support devices, such as the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and Impella, are often used in patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) with cardiogenic shock despite limited supporting clinical trial data. Methods and Results Hospitalizations for cardiogenic shock from 2016 to 2018 were identified from the National Inpatient Sample. Trends in the use of VA-ECLS with and without an IABP or Impella were assessed semiannually. Multivariable logistic regression and general linear regression evaluated the association of Impella and IABP use with in-hospital outcomes. Overall, 12035 hospitalizations with cardiogenic shock and VA-ECLS were identified, of which 3115 (26%) also received an IABP and 1880 (16%) an Impella. Use of an Impella with VA-ECLS substantially increased from 10% to 18% over this period (P < 0.001), whereas an IABP modestly increased from 25% to 26% (P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality decreased 54% to 48% for VA-ECLS only, 61% to 58% for VA-ECLS with an Impella, and 54% to 49% for VA-ECLS with an IABP (P < 0.001 each). Most (57%) IABPs or Impellas were placed on the same day as VA-ECLS. After adjustment, there were no differences in in-hospital mortality or length of stay with the addition of an IABP or Impella compared with VA-ECLS alone. Conclusions From 2016 to 2018 in the United States, use of an Impella and IABP with VA-ECLS significantly increased. More than half of Impellas and IABPs were placed on the same day as VA-ECLS, and the use of a second mechanical circulatory support device did not impact in-hospital mortality. Further studies are needed to decipher the optimal timing and patient selection for this growing practice.

### Impella support for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock [^115oTAkF]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices are increasingly used in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS), despite limited evidence for their effectiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes associated with use of the Impella device compared with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and medical treatment in patients with AMI-CS.

Methods

Data of patients with AMI-CS treated with the Impella device at European tertiary care hospitals were collected retrospectively. All patients underwent early revascularization and received optimal medical treatment. Using IABP-SHOCK II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II) trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, 372 patients were identified and included in this analysis. These patients were matched to 600 patients from the IABP-SHOCK II trial. The following baseline criteria were used as matching parameters: age, sex, mechanical ventilation, ejection fraction, prior cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and lactate. Primary end point was 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results

In total, 237 patients treated with an Impella could be matched to 237 patients from the IABP-SHOCK II trial. Baseline parameters were similarly distributed after matching. There was no significant difference in 30-day all-cause mortality (48.5% versus 46.4%, P = 0.64). Severe or life-threatening bleeding (8.5% versus 3.0%, P < 0.01) and peripheral vascular complications (9.8% versus 3.8%, P = 0.01) occurred significantly more often in the Impella group. Limiting the analysis to IABP-treated patients as a control group did not change the results.

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis of patients with AMI-CS, the use of an Impella device was not associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with matched patients from the IABP-SHOCK II trial treated with an IABP or medical therapy. To further evaluate this, a large randomized trial is warranted to determine the effect of the Impella device on outcome in patients with AMI-CS.

### Impact of baseline cardiogenic shock severity on outcomes in patients treated with impella device [^1158kESc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data Source

We used the data set of the J‐PVAD (Japanese Registry for Percutaneous Ventricular Assist Device) to investigate outcomes according to CS severity. The J‐PVAD registry is a nationwide multicenter observational study, and all patients who underwent Impella device insertion at qualified centers certified by the Impella Committee were enrolled. The J‐PVAD registry prospectively collects clinical characteristics and outcome data during index hospitalization and is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000033603). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Central Institutional Review Board of Osaka University (approval number: 17232). The J‐PVAD registry was funded by the Impella Committee. The requirement for written informed consent was waived owing to the implementation of complete data anonymization and the retrospective observational nature of the present study. Regarding data availability, the deidentified participant data will not be shared.

Study Population

Between February 2020 and December 2023, all patients who attempted to receive the Impella device at 279 hospitals across Japan were included. The exclusion criteria included Impella use due to factors other than cardiogenic shock, such as supplementary use at high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention, unsuccessful Impella insertion, missing data on patients' status at discharge and laboratory data defining the SCAI stage.

CS was defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg for ≥ 30 minutes and cardiac index < 2.2 L/min per m 2 if measured or the need for intravenous vasopressors and inotropes to maintain the blood pressure and cardiac index, accompanied by end‐organ hypoperfusion. When a patient had received another MCS device (eg, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra‐aortic balloon pump) before Impella insertion, the patient was considered to have CS, irrespective of the indications for other MCS devices.

Only 1 primary indication for Impella use at the time of insertion was selected from the following diseases by the treating physicians at each anticipated institution in the J‐PVAD registry: acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (with or without mechanical complications), myocarditis, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, and others. The choice of primary indication was left to the discretion of the local physicians.

### The management of cardiogenic shock from diagnosis to devices: a narrative review [^115coa1p]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous Ventricular Assist Device: Impella:

The Impella (Abiomed, Inc.) is a percutaneously implanted, transvalvular, axial flow pump. Axial flow is produced by an impeller that traverses the aortic valve and expels blood from the LV into the ascending aorta. The two available models for LV support are Impella CP (providing up to 4 L/min of flow) and Impella 5.5 (providing up to 5.5 L/min of flow). The CP is inserted femorally via a 14-F sheath, whereas the 5.5 is inserted via a 23-F sheath through a surgical axillary cutdown and graft. Hemodynamically, the Impella directly unloads the LV and augments CO, reducing wall stress and end-diastolic pressure and volume. Limitations of the Impella include access site complications resulting from large-bore cannulation, as well as significant risk for hemolysis (with associated renal failure) and thrombocytopenia, especially with the Impella CP. Impella placement requires fluoroscopy and, in the case of the Impella 5.5, surgical cutdown and graft anastomosis; thus, the Impella typically is not an option for emergent bedside placement.

It is the opinion of the authors that, given the modest CO support and high rates of hemolysis and kidney injury, the Impella CP is no longer considered to be an adequate longitudinal shock device at many shock referral centers. Instead, the axillary-placed Impella 5.5, which also enables ongoing rehabilitation before heart replacement therapy, is preferred for more sustained support. –

In patients with AMI-CS, the Impella was compared with the IABP in the Impella vs IABP Reduces Mortality in STEMI Patients Treated With Primary PCI in Severe Cardiogenic Shock (IMPRESS) trial, which showed no mortality benefit for the Impella over the IABP. However, it is important to note that the trial design included patients who had progressed to profound hemometabolic CS, with > 90% of patients having experienced cardiac arrest. Observational data show inconsistent findings. Although the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative touts early deployment of the Impella and demonstrated astounding inpatient survival rates of > 70%, a propensity-matched cohort study showed worse mortality with the Impella compared with the IABP and increased vascular complications. Additional randomized controlled trials are underway to assess the efficacy of the Impella in AMI-CS better. The lack of randomized data supporting the efficacy and usefulness of the Impella 5.5 device is notable.

Axial flow pumps (Impella) complications, mechanical issues, injuries, and pump stoppage — Reported complications of Impella placement include vessel perforation, extensive bleeding at insertion site, rapid progression of cardiac failure or acute RV failure, and these should be addressed as clinically appropriate. Rare device complications such as ingestion of material into motor during insertion, device fracture, cardiac perforation, valvular damage or stroke have been documented and require unique and urgent intervention, and sudden deterioration should prompt rapid evaluation for device malfunction or malposition (eg, pulled out of LV, interfering with MV apparatus or perforating LV). Mechanical issue clues include flatlined motor current can imply device out of position (both inflow and outflow seeing same pressure) or impaired LV hypocontractility, elevations in purge pressures can suggest kinking or thrombus development, and sudden changes in flows, motor current or purge pressures can imply serious malposition or mechanical complication and warrant imaging via echo, chest radiograph, or chest CT scan. For suspected mechanical cardiac injuries, sudden changes in hemodynamics should warrant echo imaging to assess presence of AI, position of inflow and outflow cages, functional MS or MR owing to injury or obstruction, and even ventricular rupture. Regarding pump stoppage, this is usually owing to kinking or obstruction from thrombus or other ingested material; if no kink is seen on chest radiograph or fluoroscopy, removal of the device and possible replacement may be needed, and loss of sensor signal can occur, especially with traumatic insertion, or prolonged support, with monitoring of motor current and patient parameters for change in clinical status allowing continuation without pump replacement. During resuscitation, the decision to perform chest compressions should be based on standard criteria; if compressions are indicated, consider dropping to P2 speed during manual compressions, and if ROSC occurs, resume support and confirm location in LV via echo, while if DCCV needed, avoid touching Impella system at time of shock.

### Different applications for left ventricular mechanical support with the impella recover 100 microaxial blood pump [^11177n3Q]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The "Impella Recover 100" (IR100) is a new intravascular microaxial blood pump for use as short-term mechanical support for cases of acutely reduced left ventricular function. From September 2002 to April 2003, we used the IR100 to support 5 patients: 2 patients were bridged to heart transplant; 2 were being treated for fulminant acute myocarditis; and 1 for post-cardiotomy low-output syndrome. Only 1 patient with myocarditis died of septic shock, 2 had successful heart transplants; and the latter 2 were slowly weaned from the device and, at 3-month follow-up, showed moderate improvement of left ventricular (LV) function. Our initial experience with the IR100 as mechanical support for patients in cardiogenic shock of varying etiology has been positive, yielding good survival in a population of particularly compromised patients.
