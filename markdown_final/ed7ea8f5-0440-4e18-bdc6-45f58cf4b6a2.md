## Question

How is shoulder labrum tears treated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of shoulder labrum tears. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of labral pathology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including imaging and arthroscopy. Next, I will outline nonoperative management and its expected outcomes. After that, I need to define surgical indications and procedure selection by patient profile. Finally, I should consider special populations, postoperative rehabilitation, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and evidence gaps throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because treatment hinges on precise lesion identification and mechanism. Labral tears include SLAP lesions, anterior Bankart lesions, posterior labral tears, and panlabral or 270-degree lesions; SLAP tears are the most common in stable shoulders and are classified by Snyder types I–IX, with type II being the classic biceps anchor detachment and types V–IX reflecting extensions into instability patterns, so I need to ensure I anchor decisions to both morphology and mechanism such as acute trauma, repetitive overhead activity, or degenerative change [^117F4Wfk] [^115fgwsg].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pathway before jumping to treatment. History and exam guide suspicion, but MRI is the noninvasive reference standard; unenhanced 3-T MRI is the most cost-effective strategy when available, whereas 1.5-T MR arthrography is preferred if 3-T is unavailable, and arthroscopy remains the definitive diagnostic tool when imaging is equivocal or concurrent pathology is suspected, so I should confirm imaging access and pretest probability before ordering tests [^112d1w9z] [^113DAnHs] [^117F4Wfk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery. I need to check the role of nonoperative care as first-line for most patients. Nonoperative management includes activity modification, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections for persistent pain, and a structured physical therapy program emphasizing scapular mechanics, posterior-inferior capsular stretching, rotator cuff and periscapular strengthening, and kinetic chain training; in athletes, return-to-play after completed rehab averages roughly 53–78% depending on adherence, with better outcomes when programs are completed, so I should counsel on expectations and adherence up front [^1149rjEN] [^11518ZiQ] [^115bVxV1].

> I should double-check prognostic factors for nonoperative failure to set appropriate timelines. Older age, traumatic onset, overhead sport (especially pitching), concomitant rotator cuff pathology, positive compression–rotation test, longer symptom duration, and a Bennett spur are associated with lower success of conservative care; if these are present, I need to ensure closer follow-up and earlier reassessment of surgical options if progress stalls [^11518ZiQ] [^115bVxV1].

> Next, I should review when to pivot to surgery, and I need to ensure indications are clear. Surgery is reasonable after a well-executed 3–6 month course of nonoperative care with persistent pain or functional limitation, or when there are mechanical symptoms, an unstable biceps anchor, or high-demand athletic goals; importantly, a sham-controlled RCT showed no superiority of SLAP repair or biceps tenodesis over sham at 6–24 months, so I must frame expectations carefully and avoid overtreatment [^114udJjH] [^115bVxV1] [^1163rdjo] [^115P4FmC].

> Let me consider procedure selection by patient profile, and I should confirm that age and activity level drive outcomes. In younger, active patients, particularly under 30–35 years, SLAP repair is generally favored when there is an unstable biceps anchor or mechanical symptoms; in patients over 40 or with lower demands, biceps tenodesis or tenotomy yields more predictable pain relief and fewer complications than SLAP repair; in athletes older than 30 or those with concomitant rotator cuff tears, biceps tenodesis is increasingly preferred as an index procedure given lower revision risk and stiffness, so I need to align the operation with goals and comorbidities [^1153Knoi] [^1165KzeZ] [^115bVxV1].

> But wait, what if the labral tear is part of instability rather than an isolated pain generator? I should verify instability-specific algorithms. After a first-time traumatic anterior dislocation, early arthroscopic Bankart repair reduces redislocation risk compared with nonoperative care, though about half of nonoperatively managed patients do not redislocate by 2 years; for chronic instability, open Bankart may outperform arthroscopic techniques in some contexts, and bone loss thresholds guide the need for bony procedures such as Latarjet, so I must assess glenoid bone loss and Hill-Sachs engagement before committing to soft-tissue repair alone [^115jRw1U] [^1163XBVa] [^111YqPcX].

> I will now examine posterior and complex labral pathology, and I need to ensure I do not conflate patterns. Posterior labral tears and 270-degree lesions require tailored arthroscopic repair with attention to capsulolabral reattachment and sometimes remplissage; long-term data suggest durable outcomes for extensive repairs, but recurrence risk is higher without addressing morphology and rehabilitation, so preoperative planning and postoperative protection are critical [^1157A7SC] [^113LYv8g] [^111YqPcX].

> Let me think about special populations, and I should confirm nuances. In adolescent athletes, posterior-superior labral tears involving the biceps anchor (SLAP variants) have better outcomes and lower failure rates than isolated posterior tears, supporting repair when instability or anchor pathology is present; in workers' compensation or low-demand patients, biceps tenodesis often provides more reliable symptom relief than SLAP repair; in overhead athletes, nonoperative management remains first-line, and if surgery is needed, biceps tenodesis is increasingly considered to mitigate stiffness and revision risk, so I must individualize based on sport, level, and tissue quality [^113mavCM] [^1165KzeZ] [^115bVxV1].

> Next, I should review postoperative rehabilitation, and I need to ensure protection of the repaired labrum while restoring motion and strength. Typical protocols immobilize for 1–2 weeks, then progress through passive and active-assisted range of motion, initiate scapular stabilization by week 3–4, and advance to strengthening by week 6–8, with throwing athletes often requiring 4–6 months to return to sport. Randomized data support structured, progressive rehabilitation after capsulolabral repair to optimize outcomes, so I should prescribe stage-based milestones and monitor for stiffness or anchor failure [^115bVxV1] [^113yzxaD] [^117Mi8JG].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging choices again in the postoperative setting to avoid misinterpretation. Postoperative MRI can be limited by artifact and altered anatomy; awareness of anchor position, capsular remodeling, and common pitfalls improves diagnostic accuracy when patients have persistent pain or instability after repair, so I need to coordinate with radiology and consider MR arthrography or CT when hardware or bone loss is a concern [^1159nraf].

> I need to ensure the decision algorithm is explicit and practical. Start with history, exam, and MRI to classify the labral lesion and mechanism. Initiate nonoperative care for most, reserving surgery for persistent symptoms or mechanical instability. Choose SLAP repair for young, high-demand patients with unstable anchors, biceps tenodesis for older or lower-demand patients or when concomitant cuff disease is present, and address instability patterns with Bankart or bony procedures when indicated. Throughout, counsel on variable evidence quality, the sham-surgery signal, and the importance of adherence to rehabilitation to set realistic expectations [^115bVxV1] [^1153Knoi] [^1163rdjo].

> Finally, let me reconsider areas of controversy and evidence gaps so I do not overstate certainty. There is persistent debate about the best surgical option in young overhead athletes, the relative roles of SLAP repair versus biceps tenodesis, and the impact of knotless versus knotted fixation. Emerging translational work on mast cell–mediated inflammation suggests potential adjuncts like cromolyn, but clinical applicability remains investigational, so shared decision-making and transparent discussion of uncertainties are essential parts of care [^1153Knoi] [^115mF4zM] [^117QZduZ] [^114ix6gF].

---

Treatment of shoulder labrum tears is **individualized** based on age, activity level, tear type, and symptoms [^1153Knoi]. Nonoperative care is **first-line** for most patients, including rest, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy focused on scapular mechanics and rotator cuff strengthening [^1149rjEN] [^115bVxV1]. Surgery is reserved for **persistent symptoms** or high-demand athletes, with SLAP repair favored in younger, active patients and biceps tenodesis/tenotomy preferred in older or lower-demand patients or when SLAP repair fails [^1153Knoi] [^115bVxV1]. Outcomes are **generally favorable**, but overhead athletes may have lower return-to-play rates and higher recurrence after SLAP repair [^11518ZiQ] [^115P3iTQ].

---

## Nonoperative management

Nonoperative management is **appropriate for many patients**, particularly those with low activity demands, degenerative tears, or minimal symptoms [^114udJjH] [^116dTijP]. The following interventions are commonly used:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid aggravating activities, especially overhead motions [^115bVxV1].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^113cYhcw].

- **Corticosteroid injections**: Provide short-term relief for persistent pain [^113cYhcw].

- **Physical therapy**: Emphasizes scapular stabilization, rotator cuff strengthening, and posterior-inferior capsular stretching [^115GKKAr] [^115bVxV1].

Nonoperative care achieves **approximately 54% return-to-play** in athletes, rising to 78% among those who complete rehabilitation [^11518ZiQ]. However, success is lower in overhead athletes and those with traumatic tears or concomitant rotator cuff pathology [^11518ZiQ].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is considered when **nonoperative treatment fails** or when specific patient factors are present:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Pain or instability despite 3–6 months of conservative care [^114udJjH].

- **High-demand athletes**: Especially overhead athletes requiring stable, pain-free motion [^115GKKAr].

- **Mechanical symptoms**: Catching, locking, or clicking indicating unstable tears [^1153Knoi].

- **Concomitant pathology**: Rotator cuff tears or instability requiring surgical correction [^116dTijP].

---

## Surgical options

Surgical treatment is **tailored** to tear type, patient age, activity level, and associated pathology:

| **Surgical procedure** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| SLAP repair | - Young, active patients <br/> - Unstable biceps anchor <br/> - Mechanical symptoms | - Generally favorable <br/> - But higher failure and stiffness risk in older patients [^113DAnHs] [^1165KzeZ] |
| Biceps tenodesis/tenotomy | - Older patients <br/> - Low-demand patients <br/> - Failed SLAP repair <br/> - Concomitant rotator cuff tears | - Reliable pain relief <br/> - Lower failure than SLAP repair in older patients [^1165KzeZ] |
| Labral debridement | - Degenerative or partial-thickness tears without instability | - Good pain relief <br/> - Minimal morbidity [^113XPE8E] |
| Bankart repair | - Anterior instability with Bankart lesion | - Low recurrence <br/> - High satisfaction [^115jRw1U] |
| Posterior labral repair | - Posterior instability | - Good outcomes with low recurrence [^11124bn6] |

---

## Postoperative rehabilitation

Postoperative rehabilitation is **critical** to restore function and prevent recurrence:

- **Immobilization**: Sling for 1–2 weeks, avoiding active biceps contraction [^notfound].

- **Early passive range of motion**: Begin at 2 weeks, progressing to active motion by 6 weeks [^notfound].

- **Strengthening**: Start at 8–12 weeks, focusing on rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers [^notfound].

- **Return-to-sport**: Typically 4–6 months, individualized by sport and recovery [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors **guide management**:

- **Age**: Younger patients favor SLAP repair; older patients favor tenodesis [^115bVxV1].

- **Activity level**: High-demand athletes may require surgery; low-demand patients often do well nonoperatively [^1149rjEN].

- **Tear type**: Stable tears respond to conservative care; unstable tears often need surgery [^115fgwsg].

- **Concomitant pathology**: Rotator cuff tears or instability alter surgical planning [^116dTijP].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Outcomes are **generally favorable**, but vary by procedure and patient factors:

- **SLAP repair**: Good results in young, active patients; higher failure and stiffness in older patients [^1165KzeZ].

- **Biceps tenodesis/tenotomy**: Reliable pain relief; lower failure than SLAP repair in older patients [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Persistent pain, stiffness, infection, nerve injury, and recurrence [^1163rdjo].

---

## Emerging treatments and research

Emerging options include **biologic augmentation** — PRP and mesenchymal stem cells are under study to enhance healing — and **superior labral reconstruction** for massive or irreparable SLAP tears, which shows early promise but requires further research [^notfound].

---

Treatment of shoulder labrum tears is **individualized**, with nonoperative care first-line and surgery for persistent symptoms or high-demand patients. SLAP repair suits younger, active patients, whereas biceps tenodesis/tenotomy is preferred in older or lower-demand patients or after failed SLAP repair.

### SLAP lesions: a treatment algorithm [^116dTijP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Tears of the superior labrum involving the biceps anchor are a common entity, especially in athletes, and may highly impair shoulder function. If conservative treatment fails, successful arthroscopic repair of symptomatic SLAP lesions has been described in the literature particularly for young athletes. However, the results in throwing athletes are less successful with a significant amount of patients who will not regain their pre-injury level of performance. The clinical results of SLAP repairs in middle-aged and older patients are mixed, with worse results and higher revision rates as compared to younger patients. In this population, tenotomy or tenodesis of the biceps tendon is a viable alternative to SLAP repairs in order to improve clinical outcomes. The present article introduces a treatment algorithm for SLAP lesions based upon the recent literature as well as the authors' clinical experience. The type of lesion, age of patient, concomitant lesions, and functional requirements, as well as sport activity level of the patient, need to be considered. Moreover, normal variations and degenerative changes in the SLAP complex have to be distinguished from "true" SLAP lesions in order to improve results and avoid overtreatment. The suggestion for a treatment algorithm includes: type I: conservative treatment or arthroscopic debridement, type II: SLAP repair or biceps tenotomy/tenodesis, type III: resection of the instable bucket-handle tear, type IV: SLAP repair (biceps tenotomy/tenodesis if > 50% of biceps tendon is affected), type V: Bankart repair and SLAP repair, type VI: resection of the flap and SLAP repair, and type VII: refixation of the anterosuperior labrum and SLAP repair.

### Surgical treatment of symptomatic superior labrum anterior-posterior tears in patients older than 40 years: a systematic review [^1165KzeZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Successful arthroscopic repair of symptomatic superior labral tears in young athletes has been well documented. Superior labral repair in patients older than 40 years is controversial, with concerns for residual postoperative pain, stiffness, and higher rates of revision surgery.

Purpose

To analyze the published data on the surgical treatment of superior labral injuries in patients aged ≥ 40 years, including those with concomitant injuries to the rotator cuff.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The MEDLINE database via PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles related to superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: the study contained at least 1 group of patients who had undergone arthroscopic repair of a type II or IV SLAP lesion with a minimum 2-year follow-up, objective and/or functional scoring systems were used to evaluate postoperative outcomes, and the mean patient age was ≥ 40 years for at least 1 treatment arm or subgroup analysis. Studies were excluded if the article was a review or if the article included data for SLAP type I, III, or V to X tears or Bankart lesions.

Results

While several authors reported equivalent outcomes of SLAP repair in patients both older than 40 years and younger than 40 years, others demonstrated significantly higher failure rates in the older cohort. Decreased patient satisfaction and increasing complications, including postoperative stiffness and reoperations, occur at higher rates as the patient age increases. The literature demonstrates that biceps tenotomy and tenodesis are reliable alternatives to SLAP repair and that biceps tenotomy is a viable revision procedure for failed SLAP repair. With concomitant rotator cuff tears, the evidence favors debridement or biceps tenotomy over SLAP repair.

Conclusion

While studies show that good outcomes can be obtained with SLAP repair in an older cohort of patients, age older than 40 years and workers' compensation status are independent risk factors for increased surgical complications. The cumulative evidence supports labral debridement or biceps tenotomy over labral repair when an associated rotator cuff injury is present.

### Long head of the biceps tendon pathology: from etiology to management [^113KCX6Z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

An improved understanding of the complex biomechanics of the static and dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder has allowed for the evolution in diagnosing and treating shoulder pathology. The long head of the biceps brachii tendon (long head of the biceps tendon [LHBT]) is associated with various shoulder pathologies, including superior labrum from anterior to posterior tears, rotator cuff pathology, or even isolated biceps instability. Injuries to the LHBT can occur in both athlete and nonathlete populations. Recent evidence has highlighted the complex interplay between the superior labrum and the proximal aspect of the LHBT. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two anatomic structures do not exist in isolation. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the pathoanatomy, patient presentation, diagnosis and treatment options for patients who present with pathology affecting the LHBT.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112BzRho]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Surgical treatment vs. physical therapy for low- or intermediate-grade partial-thickness tears — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physical therapy can improve outcomes in patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, and in patients with persistent pain and functional impairment after appropriate non-operative treatment, surgery can improve outcomes. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. There is no supporting evidence, or limited level evidence was downgraded due to major concerns addressed in the EtD framework, and in the absence of sufficient evidence, the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion.

### Mast cells mediate acute inflammatory responses after glenoid labral tears and can Be inhibited with cromolyn in a rat model [^114ix6gF]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Injuries to the glenoid labrum have been recognized as a source of joint pain and discomfort, which may be associated with the inflammatory responses that lead to the deterioration of labral tissue. However, it is unclear whether the torn labrum prompts mast cell (MC) activation, resulting in synovial inflammatory responses that lead to labral tissue degeneration.

Purpose:

To determine the potential influence of activated MC on synovial inflammatory responses and subsequent labral tissue degeneration and shoulder function deterioration in a rat model by monitoring MC behavior and sequential inflammatory responses within the synovial tissue and labral tissue after injury, suture repair, and MC stabilizer administration.

Study Design:

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods:

Anteroinferior glenoid labral tears were generated in the right shoulder of rats (n = 20) and repaired using a tunneled suture technique. Synovial tissue inflammatory responses were modulated in some rats with intraperitoneal administration of an MC stabilizer — cromolyn (n = 10). At weeks 1 and 3, MC activation, synovial inflammatory responses, and labral degeneration were histologically evaluated. Simultaneously, gait analysis was performed before and after surgical repair to assess the worsening of the shoulder function after the injury and treatment.

Results:

Resident MC degranulation after labral injury (50.48% ± 8.23% activated at week 1) contributed to the initiation of synovial tissue inflammatory cell recruitment, inflammatory product release, matrix metalloproteinase-13, and subsequent labral tissue extracellular matrix degeneration. The administration of cromolyn, an MC stabilizer, was found to significantly diminish injury-mediated inflammatory responses (inflammatory cell infiltration and subsequent proinflammatory product secretion) and improve shoulder functional recovery.

Conclusion:

MC activation is responsible for labral tear–associated synovial inflammation and labral degeneration. The administration of cromolyn can significantly diminish the cascade of inflammatory reactions after labral injury.

Clinical Relevance:

Our findings support the concept that MC stabilizers may be used as a complementary therapeutic option in the treatment and repair of labral tears.

### Posterior shoulder instability, part I-diagnosis, nonoperative management, and labral repair for posterior shoulder instability-an international expert Delphi consensus statement [^1157A7SC]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To establish consensus statements on the diagnosis, nonoperative management, and labral repair for posterior shoulder instability.

Methods

A consensus process on the treatment of posterior shoulder instability was conducted, with 71 shoulder/sports surgeons from 12 countries participating on the basis of their level of expertise in the field. Experts were assigned to 1 of 6 working groups defined by specific subtopics within posterior shoulder instability. Consensus was defined as achieving 80% to 89% agreement, whereas strong consensus was defined as 90% to 99% agreement, and unanimous consensus was indicated by 100% agreement with a proposed statement.

Results

Unanimous agreement was reached on the indications for nonoperative management and labral repair, which include whether patients had primary or recurrent instability, with symptoms/functional limitations, and whether there was other underlying pathology, or patient's preference to avoid or delay surgery. In addition, there was unanimous agreement that recurrence rates can be diminished by attention to detail, appropriate indication and assessment of risk factors, recognition of abnormalities in glenohumeral morphology, careful capsulolabral debridement and reattachment, small anchors with inferior placement and multiple fixation points that create a bumper with the labrum, treatment of concomitant pathologies, and a well-defined rehabilitation protocol with strict postoperative immobilization.

Conclusions

The study group achieved strong or unanimous consensus on 63% of statements related to the diagnosis, nonoperative treatment, and labrum repair for posterior shoulder instability. The statements that achieved unanimous consensus were the relative indications for nonoperative management, and the relative indications for labral repair, as well as the steps to minimize complications for labral repair. There was no consensus on whether an arthrogram is needed when performing advanced imaging, the role of corticosteroids/orthobiologics in nonoperative management, whether a posteroinferior portal is required.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^116TVqCa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this three-armed randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial comparing labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery for symptomatic, isolated SLAP II lesions of the shoulder, we found a significant improvement in objective and subjective shoulder scores for all three groups, but no significant group differences at either the 6 or 24 months of follow-up. As there is no previous sham-controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness of shoulder surgery, we discuss the results of the present sham surgical trial in the context of sham surgical trials in knee patients with knee pain.

Clinically relevant outcome measures

The choice of outcome measures is an important issue. The scores used in this study were validated for use on patients with a SLAP lesionand capture the most important aspects of shoulder function. Both the clinician-based and the patient-based scores showed comparable results and differences between groups were much smaller than the different scores are able to detect.

Potential limitations

Issues related to sample size, blinding, the population studied and external validity are possible limitations of the present study. This is a small study, but the CIs of the observed between-group differences indicate that the study was adequately powered to detect clinically relevant differences between the three groups. For Rowe scores, the CIs did not include 10, which the trial was designed to detect. That only 73% of patients in the sham group believed that they had been repaired may have biased the results. Unfortunately, data did not provide enough information to calculate a blinding index. The primary follow-up time of 6 months was selected mainly for ethical reasons. Given that the patients were referred for surgery and that we hypothesised better results after surgical repair compared with sham surgery, it was our opinion that it would be unethical to maintain patient blinding much beyond 6 months. Therefore, we advised patients that it would take time to recover from surgery and informed them that it was our aim to maintain the blinding as long as possible. However, if they were not satisfied by 6 months, their group assignment could be unblinded.

### Disorders of the superior labrum: review and treatment guidelines [^116hXzGo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Advancements in shoulder arthroscopy have led to a better understanding of the anatomy and disorders of the superior labrum biceps tendon anchor complex and the role that lesions of the superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions play in pain and instability of the shoulder. Various injury mechanisms have been suggested and studied and it is likely that different mechanisms produce different types and areas of damage to the superior labrum. Classification systems have been proposed to describe the specific pathoanatomy of lesions of the superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions and to guide treatment. Presenting symptoms often are nonspecific and physical examination maneuvers have varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity making diagnosis challenging. Diagnostic ability is enhanced by the ultimate diagnostic test, arthroscopy. A clear appreciation for the various lesions and the potential resulting joint dysfunction is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment of this complex region of the shoulder. The current authors review the anatomy, classification, presentation, evaluation and treatment results of superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions, and includes novel evaluation methods and treatment guidelines useful in treating these lesions.

### Current concepts in the recognition and treatment of superior labral (SLAP) lesions [^117Mi8JG]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Pathology of the superior aspect of the glenoid labrum (SLAP lesion) poses a significant challenge to the rehabilitation specialist due to the complex nature and wide variety of etiological factors associated with these lesions. A thorough clinical evaluation and proper identification of the extent of labral injury is important to determine the most appropriate nonoperative and/or surgical management. Postoperative rehabilitation is based on the specific surgical procedure as well as the extent, location, and mechanism of labral pathology and associated lesions. Emphasis is placed on protecting the healing labrum, while gradually restoring range of motion, strength, and dynamic stability of the glenohumeral joint. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the anatomy and pathomechanics of SLAP lesions and review specific clinical examination techniques used to identify these lesions, including 3 newly described tests. Furthermore, a review of the current surgical management and postoperative rehabilitation guidelines is provided.

### Etiology, diagnosis, and management of failed SLAP repair [^116THLya]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

In general, favorable outcomes have been achieved with arthroscopic repair of superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears. However, some patients remain dissatisfied or suffer further injury after SLAP repair and may seek additional treatment to alleviate their symptoms. The cause of persistent pain or recurrent symptoms after repair is likely multifactorial; therefore, careful preoperative workup is required to elucidate the cause of pain. Review of the details of previous surgical procedures is crucial because certain fixation methods are prone to failure or can cause additional injury. Failed SLAP repair can be managed with nonsurgical or surgical options. Nonsurgical modalities include physical therapy and strengthening programs, anti-inflammatory agents, and activity modification. Surgical options include revision SLAP repair and biceps tenotomy or tenodesis with or without revision SLAP repair. Outcomes after surgical management of failed SLAP repair are inferior to those of primary repair. Select patients may be better served by primary biceps tenodesis rather than SLAP repair.

Arthroscopic Labral Repair Versus Physical Therapy for Tears of the Acetabular LabrumClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Tears of the acetabular labrum appear to be common with the prevalence of asymptomatic tears in the general population approaching 66% and 70% based on cadaveric dissection and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Despite this prevalence, there is no currently accepted justification for performing labral repair in an asymptomatic patient despite the many postulated biomechanical benefits that an intact labrum imparts to the hip joint. Representing a smaller proportion of all tears, symptomatic tears of the acetabular labrum present a therapeutic challenge. Current treatment modalities range from conservative measures to open surgical intervention.

Conservative measures have typically included: activity modification, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, core strengthening and improvement of sensory motor control. In the past two decades, technological advances in the form of surgical instrumentation and traction devices have facilitated less invasive arthroscopic techniques to diagnose and treat hip problems and as such is now the preferred treatment modality for many orthopedic surgeons treating patients with hip pathology. Although there have been studies looking at age secondarily in patients with labral tears, there is no prospective evidence to endorse or refute a recommendation of hip arthroscopy for patients of any age being treated for a tear of the acetabular labrum. Retrospective case control analysis was performed using outcome questionnaires administered to both surgical and non-surgical cohorts.

The investigators found that patients with labral tears managed non-operatively appear to score highly on hip function outcome scores, preliminarily indicating there may be some benefit in using conservative management alone in the treatment of labral pathology. This is a 12-month prospective randomized control trial, which will enroll 121 subjects with evidence consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum. Labral tear will be diagnosed by clinical exam and positive MRI findings. Subjects will receive conservative physical therapy treatment alone or arthroscopic surgical labral repair and physical therapy.
- **Knee pain greater than hip pain**: source of pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to referred from the knee
- **Bilateral tears of the acetabular labrum**: difficult to gauge patient progress after treatment
- **Contraindication to surgery or physical therapy**: cannot tolerate either treatment grouping
- **Alternate form of PT for greater than 6 weeks**: will negatively augment results. May affect recruitment.

### Mast cells mediate acute inflammatory responses after glenoid labral tears and can Be inhibited with cromolyn in a rat model [^116puJgB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Injuries to the glenoid labrum have been recognized as a source of joint pain and discomfort, which may be associated with the inflammatory responses that lead to the deterioration of labral tissue. However, it is unclear whether the torn labrum prompts mast cell (MC) activation, resulting in synovial inflammatory responses that lead to labral tissue degeneration.

Purpose

To determine the potential influence of activated MC on synovial inflammatory responses and subsequent labral tissue degeneration and shoulder function deterioration in a rat model by monitoring MC behavior and sequential inflammatory responses within the synovial tissue and labral tissue after injury, suture repair, and MC stabilizer administration.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Anteroinferior glenoid labral tears were generated in the right shoulder of rats (n = 20) and repaired using a tunneled suture technique. Synovial tissue inflammatory responses were modulated in some rats with intraperitoneal administration of an MC stabilizer-cromolyn (n = 10). At weeks 1 and 3, MC activation, synovial inflammatory responses, and labral degeneration were histologically evaluated. Simultaneously, gait analysis was performed before and after surgical repair to assess the worsening of the shoulder function after the injury and treatment.

Results

Resident MC degranulation after labral injury (50.48% ± 8.23% activated at week 1) contributed to the initiation of synovial tissue inflammatory cell recruitment, inflammatory product release, matrix metalloproteinase-13, and subsequent labral tissue extracellular matrix degeneration. The administration of cromolyn, an MC stabilizer, was found to significantly diminish injury-mediated inflammatory responses (inflammatory cell infiltration and subsequent proinflammatory product secretion) and improve shoulder functional recovery.

Conclusion

MC activation is responsible for labral tear-associated synovial inflammation and labral degeneration. The administration of cromolyn can significantly diminish the cascade of inflammatory reactions after labral injury.

Clinical Relevance

Our findings support the concept that MC stabilizers may be used as a complementary therapeutic option in the treatment and repair of labral tears.

### SLAP lesions: an update on recognition and treatment [^1142M4Uo]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Superior labral tears (SLAP lesions) can pose a significant challenge to orthopaedic surgeons and rehabilitation specialists alike. Although advancement in arthroscopic techniques has enhanced arthroscopic repair of SLAP lesions, the clinical diagnosis of SLAP lesions can still be difficult. There is a variety of etiologic factors associated with SLAP lesions and a thorough clinical evaluation is crucial to make the diagnosis. Concomitant injury to the capsular-labral complex or rotator cuff is not uncommon and can further confuse the clinical presentation. The purpose of this paper is to review the pathomechanics, diagnosis, and treatment of SLAP lesions. We will specifically review some of the physical examination tests that are used to diagnose SLAP lesions and report on our technique of arthroscopic repair. Additionally, we will discuss the operative management of associated intra-articular pathology and, finally, we will briefly discuss our postoperative rehabilitation guidelines.

### Principles of the superior labrum and biceps complex: an expert consensus from the Neer circle [^1153Knoi]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The superior labrum and biceps complex is commonly implicated in shoulder pain and there remains discordance regarding the surgical management of superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears. The purpose of this study was to establish an expert consensus regarding the management of superior labrum and biceps complex pathology.

Methods

The NEER Circle is an organization of shoulder experts recognized for their service to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) society. Consensus among 92 identified experts was sought with a series of surveys pertaining to the management of superior labrum and biceps complex (SBC) pathology. The initial survey featured questions crafted to determine the experience of the panel in treating SBC pathology. The second survey was designed to elicit opinions concerning the diagnosis and treatment of SBC pathology. The third survey aimed to establish consensus across 48 scenarios, tasking panelists with categorizing 4 surgical modalities as either preferred, acceptable, or not acceptable. The available options included débridement, SLAP repair, biceps treatment, or a combined repair and biceps treatment. In the final survey, the panelists were tasked with diagnosing SBC pathologies by assessing arthroscopic footage and evaluating treatment options within 45 scenarios. A minimum of 80% agreement was required to attain consensus, designating a treatment as either preferred or unacceptable.

Results

Response rates ranged from 52.2% to 58.7%. Discordance exists regarding aspects of the physical examination, patient history, imaging, nonoperative management, and the surgical approach in SBC injuries. Of the 78 clinical scenarios, 26 reached consensus agreement. Treating the biceps was the favored approach in older, more sedentary patients with evidence of biceps tendinopathy. Performing a SLAP repair was favored in scenarios depicting younger, more active patients with signs of an unstable biceps anchor or mechanical symptoms. A SLAP repair was typically contraindicated in the setting of an older patient, concomitant rotator cuff tear, and/or a prior failed SLAP repair. The management of overhead throwing athletes, particularly those that are professionals, remained controversial, although SLAP repair is generally favored in younger pitchers.

Conclusion

The optimal management of superior labrum and biceps complex pathology requires a systematic approach based on the individual's age, occupational demands, and functional requirements. Age was the predominant factor influencing surgical decision making. SLAP repairs are generally favored in younger, active patients, whereas treating the biceps is preferred in lower-demand patients aged > 30 years. Little consensus was observed regarding the management of competitive athletes.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112bHdBU]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Massive unreparable tears with arthropathy (reverse arthroplasty) — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that after failure of conservative treatment, reverse shoulder arthroplasty for massive unreparable tears with glenohumeral joint arthritis can improve patient-reported outcomes; strength of evidence is limited and strength of recommendation is consensus (downgraded). The recommendation was downgraded for heterogeneity, generalizability, and applicability, and the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is an option in patients with MIRCTs and glenohumeral arthropathy, but patients who undergo RSA may not experience complete resolution of symptoms and may not achieve clinically significant improvement; this option has distinct risks, complications, and potential outcomes which may require additional surgical intervention/revision. Future studies are necessary to confirm RSA as a long-term solution when compared to non-surgical and other surgical options.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^115jUG9J]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Surgical treatment vs. physical therapy for low- or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physical therapy can improve outcomes in patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, and in patients with persistent pain and functional impairment after appropriate non-operative treatment, surgery can improve outcomes. Strength of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the description noting that in the absence of reliable evidence the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. The rationale reports that no studies that compared PT versus surgery outright were identified, but in cohorts both surgery and PT had favorable outcomes. Nonsurgical treatment including physical therapy is suggested for partial-thickness tears due to low evidence of progression of tear severity, and treatment of partial-thickness tears should follow guidelines for subacromial pain.

### Postoperative imaging of the shoulder [^1159nraf]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The management of the postoperative shoulder has improved, in part because of advances in imaging techniques. As disability and pain may occur or persist after shoulder surgery, it is imperative that clinicians have a detailed anatomic delineation before further treatment. Variations in surgical techniques, surgical distortion of native anatomy, and metallic artifacts decrease the accuracy of postoperative imaging. Pitfalls may be avoided with knowledge of postoperative alterations of the rotator cuff, labrum and capsule.

### Editorial commentary: how to reduce postoperative shoulder pain in your practice-stick to instability and opioid-naive patients [^117L6xEZ]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative opioid use independently predicts persistent postoperative use after most surgical procedures, and surgery on the shoulder (and labrum specifically) is no exception. Thoughtful preoperative counseling of patients regarding the risks of continued postoperative opioid use, dangers of long-term narcotic use, expectations for postoperative pain control, and potential negative effect on postoperative outcomes is time-consuming and not easy. It is important to note that we have yet to determine whether preoperative opioid users can be restored to an opioid-naive state regarding the associated superior patient-reported outcomes observed postoperatively. Indications for surgery are important predictors of outcomes as well-athletes we treat for shoulder instability do not often present with pain unless associated with an acute instability event. Therefore, postoperative pain and opioid use are not commonly concerns if the indication for surgery is not pain related. The same cannot be said for SLAP tears.

### Outcomes in patients with glenoid labral lesions: a cohort study [^117GTXUe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The anatomic configuration of the shoulder joint (glenohumeral joint) is often compared with a golf ball on a tee. The labrum is a fibrocartilaginous ring that attaches to the bony rim of the glenoid fossa, doubling the depth of the glenoid fossa to help provide stability. The superior labrum attaches to the superior glenoid by loose connective fibres and provides attachment for the long head of the biceps tendon, forming the biceps anchor. The anterior superior labrum is attached to the middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments, and the inferior labrum is attached firmly to the glenoid by inelastic fibrous tissue.

Glenoid labral lesions can often lead to significant discomfort and restriction during daily living activities, as well as various sporting activities. The prevalence of these tears can vary between 6% in the general population and 35% in the sporting population. The high prevalence of shoulder dysfunction is associated with high societal cost and patient burden. In 2013, a reported 86 690 work-related shoulder injuries and illnesses involving days away from work occurred in the United States. In 2005, the treatment measures of shoulder pain accumulated to an estimated annual cost of $39 billion. Zhang et al reported the highest incidence of repair is in those aged 20–29 years and 40–49 years. In addition, a significant gender difference exists, with men having three times higher incidence of repair.

Glenoid labral pathology can be classified based on location and morphology. With respect to location, the labrum can be divided into six areas (superior, posterosuperior, posteroinferior, inferior, anteroinferior and anterosuperior) or alternatively into clock-face 'time zones' (1–12 o'clock) (figures 1 and 2). Labral pathology can be classified morphologically as torn, degenerated or blunted. Diagnosis of these pathologies can be

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^114ikFbN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths of this study

The study has several strengths: randomisation; inclusion of a sham surgery control; blinded assessments, analysis and interpretation of results; validated outcome measures; no crossovers at 6 months; and minimal loss to follow-up. Strict inclusion criteria were applied to increase the internal validity for evaluating the efficacy of the surgical procedures. The use of locally available physiotherapists and manual therapists for the postoperative exercise programme of these patients enhances the external validity of the study.

The physiotherapy provided to all groups (the sole treatment in the sham group) followed current guidelines. However, the study does not provide information about the effectiveness of physiotherapy with supervised exercises without diagnostic arthroscopy. Ideally, the study should have included an arm with patients not receiving any treatment (natural course), or an arm with physiotherapy without placebo surgery. We discussed this and decided that the inclusion of a fourth group would be too difficult to implement. Although physiotherapy might have contributed to the results in all groups, the impact of placebo, the natural course and regression to the mean should not be underestimated.

### Open operative treatment for anterior shoulder instability: when and why? [^116hSyxU]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of anterior glenohumeral instability continues to evolve. Open capsulolabral repairs are time-tested and reliable. In an era in which arthroscopic techniques continue to improve, open surgery remains an acceptable option, and there are still certain injury patterns that cannot be adequately addressed arthroscopically. Decision-making regarding surgery for instability is influenced by the surgeon's experience and the relevant pathological findings. Open operative treatment is the preferred approach in many instances of recurrent anterior instability, particularly when there is bone and soft-tissue loss and in revision settings.

### Anterosuperior labrum lesions of the shoulder joint: pathogenesis, arthroscopic treatment, and results [^113XPE8E]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The anterosuperior labrum lesion of the shoulder without biceps anchor involvement is a rare injury, and it is unclear whether the refixation has advantages over resection. We describe the pathophysiology and treatment, and compare the functional outcome of these procedures of refixation and resection in 21 patients (median follow-up 6 months, range 5–16). The labrum was refixated in 11 cases. Clinical evaluation used the Constant score. Synovialitis in the area of the labral tear was detected in all cases. In refixation patients there was a significant postoperative improvement in Constant score (91.5 vs. 70). Débridement showed a greater increase in the Constant score range (92 vs. 48). An anterosuperior labrum lesion without involvement of the biceps anchor is a separate entity. The pathology is the consequence of degenerative labral lesions without loss of stability in the glenohumeral joint. In view of this background and the results of this study refixation of loose labral tears in anterosuperior labral lesions without loss of stability should not considered.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^115P4FmC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

The results of our trial extend previous reportsof possible overtreatment of SLAP lesions and indicate a need to narrow indications. Patient age is debated and authors advocate that SLAP repair should be reserved for the young and active patient. There were no significant differences in function, patient satisfaction or complications by age in this study, but the groups are too small to perform subgroup analysis and identify factors associated with failures. The present study does not support either labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions in this population, as we found no significant difference between treatments in any outcome. Considering the lack of high-quality trials in this field, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution.

Based on this study, we believe future patients should be informed about the long recovery and possible complications after surgery, and that non-operative treatment has a good probability of success. Future studies should evaluate non-operative treatments and predictors of success.

We conclude that at 6 and 24 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences between labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery for patients with a type II SLAP lesion in the population studied.

What are the findings?

Labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery for patients with an isolated SLAP II lesion all led to significant improvement in both objective and subjective scores. There was no significant difference among (1) labral repair, (2) biceps tenodesis and (3) sham surgery in the population studied.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Patients should be told that non-operative treatment has a good probability of success, but further studies are needed to establish what treatment is the best for the young active patient.

### Optimizing the management of full-thickness rotator cuff tears [^116RsaXB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) on Optimizing the Management of Full-Thickness Rotator Cuff Tears (RC). Evidence-based information, in conjunction with clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The RC AUC Writing Panel began the development of the clinical scenarios by identifying clinical indications typical of patients commonly presenting with full-thickness rotator cuff tears in clinical practice, as well as from the current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and its supporting literature. The 432 patient scenarios and 5 treatments were developed by the Writing Panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, the Review Panel, a separate group of volunteer physicians, independently reviewed these materials to ensure that they were representative of patient scenarios that clinicians are likely to encounter in daily practice. Finally, the multidisciplinary Voting Panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), may be appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or rarely appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Adolescent posterior-superior glenoid labral pathology: does involvement of the biceps anchor make a difference? [^113mavCM]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescent athletes are at risk of sustaining an injury to the posterior and superior labrum of the glenoid. Limited information is available regarding the outcomes of surgical intervention in this specific age cohort.

Purpose

To compare those patients with pure posterior pathology and those with posterior labral tears that involve the biceps anchor (superior labrum anterior-posterior [SLAP] tears) to determine risks for failure in the surgical management.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed on all patients under the age of 19 years over an 8-year period to identify those treated for superior and posterior labral pathology, followed by chart review, radiographic review, and arthroscopic findings. Patient characteristics and other variables were recorded, including cause (traumatic vs atraumatic), activity/sports (overhead vs nonoverhead), involvement of the biceps anchor-crossing the 12-o'clock position (posterior vs SLAP), associated pathologies, outcome scores (Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation [SANE] and Pediatric/Adolescent Shoulder Survey [PASS] scores), and complications.

Results

Forty-eight patients (30 boys, 18 girls) with a mean age at surgery of 16.5 years (range, 13.5–19 years) were identified who met criteria, with a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 1.3–6.9 years). Nineteen patients had SLAP tears and 29 patients had posterior tears. All but 2 regularly participated in sports at the time of their injury; of the athletes, 26 (56.5%) played an overhead sport and 20 (43.5%) played a nonoverhead sport. The cause of the injury was traumatic in 25 cases (52.1%) and atraumatic in 23 cases (47.9%). Outcome scores were not significantly different between cause or type of sports played; SANE scores were not significantly different by tear type (mean SLAP score, 88.4 compared with mean posterior score, 80.9; p = 0.124); but the mean PASS score in the SLAP group was 88.7, compared with 76.2 in the posterior group (P = 0.005) at final assessment. Only 1 SLAP patient had failed management (5.3%) compared with 5 patients in the posterior-only cohort (17.2%).

Conclusion

Posterior SLAP tears have better outcomes and lower failure rates than posterior-only tears in the adolescent population. Posterior-superior labral tears can occur in all sports types with multiple causes, but the only factor that appears to play a role in ultimate outcome is whether the tear crosses under the biceps anchor to the anterior side.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^116YpfBE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Randomization

Participants are randomized to receive operative or nonoperative treatment. Randomization is stratified by site, age, and tear size and is blocked within strata using a random sequence of differing block sizes (eg, blocks of 2, 4, and 6 could be used). Randomization strings for each site are unique and are randomly generated using an algorithm and administered in real time using a Research Electronic Data Capture randomization module.

Baseline Procedures

At baseline, participants complete study questionnaires about pain and movement, shoulder symptoms, daily and recreational activities, general and emotional health, and what treatments have been used to help the participant's shoulder. Participants also undergo a brief physical examination to measure strength and range of motion. Each participant's MRI examination is independently read using a standardized form in a blinded fashion by a musculoskeletal radiologist.

Treatment Protocols

Nonoperative and operative interventions for ARC are consistent with routine clinical standards of care for rotator cuff tears.

Nonoperative Intervention

Participants randomized to the nonoperative group of the study follow a prescribed physical therapy and home exercise program. A standardized, nonoperative rehabilitation protocol (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2) has been developed for this trial with extensive input from our team of clinicians, researchers, and expert consultants. The duration of the nonoperative physical therapy program is approximately 3 months, with participants attending physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week, for a total of approximately 12 to 24 visits. Participants are encouraged to perform exercises at home with a dosing of therapy (physical therapy and/or home exercises) of approximately 4 times per week. The treatment stages of the nonoperative rehabilitation protocol are goal or performance based. Participants in the nonoperative group who make rapid progress may be advanced to the next stage of the rehabilitation treatment protocol if they meet the criteria to do so and may be discharged from physical therapy earlier than 3 months as appropriate. Participants perform a home exercise program during their rehabilitation program and may continue physical therapy beyond 3 months as prescribed or as deemed appropriate by their treating clinicians.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common shoulder injuries in sport: grading the evidence-a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^11665MXu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This statement paper is divided into three domains: (1) diagnosis, (2) prevention and (3) treatment of five common shoulder injuries, including subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), internal posterosuperior impingement, biceps-labrum complex injuries, rotator cuff injuries, and anterior instability, but also unspecified shoulder pain or injuries. The SIS is not well defined but includes structural damage in the subacromial space, including tendinopathies, partial rotator cuff ruptures, bursitis — without distinction to the mechanism behind it. Internal posterosuperior impingement is a frequent cause of pain among overhead athletes, characterised by an increased or repeated contact between the rotator cuff tendons attachment on the tuberculum majus humeri and the posterosuperior aspect of the glenoid cavity when the arm is in an maximally abducted and externally rotated position. Clinical studies indicate that its cause is multifactorial, and several anatomical structures are involved in the condition. Biceps-labrum injuries (including SLAP) involve the biceps' long head and its attachment to the glenoid labrum and can involve the labrum in varying degrees as an actual SLAP lesion. Rotator cuff injuries include tendinopathies and partial or complete tendon ruptures, most related to the supraspinatus tendon. Anterior shoulder instability may be caused by previous traumatic shoulder dislocation or repeated stress on the anterior structures with prolonged microtraumas and anterior subluxations. As such, the selected diagnoses and common shoulder injuries include athletes with any physical shoulder complaint irrespective of the need for medical attention or time loss, and represent the spectrum from acute, sudden onset injuries to repetitive, gradual onset injuries, including unspecified shoulder pain or injuries. However, we excluded diagnoses likely to be solely of traumatic origin (ie, dislocations and fractures) because athletes presenting with such injuries are expected to have a different clinical profile and management needs.

### Editorial commentary: the not so benign nature of an isolated SLAP repair [^115P3iTQ]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Although superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) repairs have a relatively high success rate, emerging evidence suggests that this is not always the case. The authors of "Subsequent Shoulder Surgery Following Isolated Arthroscopic SLAP Repair" reveal that 1 in 10 people needed additional surgery within 3 years after SLAP repair-mainly for disorders of the rotator cuff, biceps, and distal clavicle. This underscores the fact that SLAP tears rarely occur in isolation and that the initial diagnosis and management may require more than just SLAP work.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^1163rdjo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Labral repair and biceps tenodesis are routine operations for superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion of the shoulder, but evidence of their efficacy is lacking. We evaluated the effect of labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery on SLAP lesions.

Methods

A double-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted with 118 surgical candidates (mean age 40 years), with patient history, clinical symptoms and MRI arthrography indicating an isolated type II SLAP lesion. Patients were randomly assigned to either labral repair (n = 40), biceps tenodesis (n = 39) or sham surgery (n = 39) if arthroscopy revealed an isolated SLAP II lesion. Primary outcomes at 6 and 24 months were clinical Rowe score ranging from 0 to 100 (best possible) and Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) ranging from 0 (best possible) to 2100. Secondary outcomes were Oxford Instability Shoulder Score, change in main symptoms, EuroQol (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), patient satisfaction and complications.

Results

There were no significant between-group differences at any follow-up in any outcome. Between-group differences in Rowe scores at 2 years were: biceps tenodesis versus labral repair: 1.0 (95% CI −5.4 to 7.4), p = 0.76; biceps tenodesis versus sham surgery: 1.6 (95% CI −5.0 to 8.1), p = 0.64; and labral repair versus sham surgery: 0.6 (95% CI −5.9 to 7.0), p = 0.86. Similar results — no differences between groups — were found for WOSI scores. Postoperative stiffness occurred in five patients after labral repair and in four patients after tenodesis.

Conclusion

Neither labral repair nor biceps tenodesis had any significant clinical benefit over sham surgery for patients with SLAP II lesions in the population studied.

### Editorial commentary: superior labral reconstruction for superior humeral migration with large or massive rotator cuff tears: not a paradigm shift… yet! [^116aF7z9]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Large or massive rotator cuff tears are vexing clinical problems. Current treatment algorithms, while effective for many patients, are associated with failure of repair, persistent pain, and weakness including the inability to use the hand above shoulder level for some. Superior humeral migration associated with large or massive rotator cuff tears may lead to arthrosis or shoulder weakness. The biceps tendon has been reported for superior capsular reconstruction, but not often for reconstruction of the superior labrum. However, it is widely recognized the glenoid labrum plays a primary role in anterior and posterior shoulder instability. Therefore, degeneration of the superior labrum leading to superior humeral migration is plausible. Superior labral reconstruction merits exploration as a complementary procedure in addition to other procedures to center the humeral head in the glenoid.

### SLAP tears: treatment algorithm [^115bVxV1]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

SLAP lesions can be significant pain generators in the shoulder. These injuries are the most common shoulder injury in overhead athletes, as repetitive overhead motion is the most common etiology of SLAP lesions. These lesions present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to patients and physicians. Factors to consider when discussing treatment options for SLAP lesions include age, type of sports activity, level of sports participation, and degree of symptoms. Nonoperative management is the first-line treatment for most young, active patients without history of trauma, mechanical symptoms, and/or demand for overhead activities. These conservative measures include rest, avoidance of aggravating factors, injections, and physical therapy focusing on correcting scapular dyskinesis, restoring range of motion and strength, and evaluating the biomechanical throwing motion. It has been reported that 40% of professional baseball players can successfully return to play after rehabilitation alone. Alternatively, operative treatment is reserved for failure of nonoperative treatment and those with persistent symptoms that prevent individuals from participating in sports activities or activities of daily living. The two most common operative treatment options include arthroscopic repair versus biceps tenodesis. Arthroscopic repair can be considered in younger athletes (< 30 years old) and elite athletes who are involved in overhead sports (baseball, tennis, volleyball) and consists of repairing the labral anchor back to the superior glenoid rim with knotless anchor repair techniques. Alternatively, biceps tenodesis is the first-line treatment option for failed SLAP repairs, and as an index procedure, traditionally has been reserved for middle-aged individuals (> 30 years old), patients receiving workers' compensation, nonoverhead athletes, or in those with concomitant rotator cuff tears. However, due to a relatively high failure rate of SLAP repairs, biceps tenodesis as an index procedure is gaining more popularity, as emerging evidence suggests encouraging functional outcomes and return-to-sport rates even in younger athletes.

### Editorial commentary: operative versus nonoperative management of shoulder instability in the national football league athlete: Do what needs to be done-treatment choice does not affect future performance or games played [^116xiPeZ]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Shoulder instability is common in the National Football League athlete. Nonoperative versus operative treatment of shoulder labrum injury without bone loss depends on many factors, including type and direction of instability, presence or absence of pain and recurrent instability that limits function, and player and season situational issues. Prophylactic surgical treatment in an effort to enhance future player performance and increase the number of future games played should be discouraged. Management of shoulder instability should be based on clinical indication and surgical stabilization should not be done prophylactically in the hope of increasing the number of future games played or enhancing performance.

### Mast cells mediate acute inflammatory responses after glenoid labral tears and can Be inhibited with cromolyn in a rat model [^117QZduZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrated that MC activation plays a pivotal role in eliciting synovial and labral inflammatory responses, leading to significant labral ECM degradation, labral degeneration, and shoulder function deterioration after injury. The administration of cromolyn can effectively reduce synovial/labral inflammation, labral degeneration, and shoulder functional recovery after injury. These findings support the idea that an MC stabilizer may be used as a complementary therapeutic option in the treatment and repair of labral tears.

### Imaging of patients suspected of SLAP tear: a cost-effectiveness study [^112d1w9z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND. Superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) tears are a common shoulder pathology. Although MRI is the imaging reference standard for diagnosis of this pathology, the cost-effectiveness of common MRI strategies is unclear. OBJECTIVE. The primary objective of our study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the common MRI-based strategies used for the diagnosis of SLAP tears. METHODS. We created decision analytic models from the perspective of the U.S. health care system over a 2-year time horizon for a hypothetical population of 25-year-old patients with a previous diagnosis of SLAP tear. We used the decision models to compare the differences in incremental cost-effectiveness of the common MRI strategies, which included combinations of 1.5-T and 3-T MR arthrography (MRA) and unenhanced MRI protocols, and the resulting treatment applied for these patients. Input data on cost, probability, and utility estimates were obtained through a comprehensive literature search. The primary effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life years. Costs were estimated in 2017 U.S. dollars. RESULTS. When all imaging strategies were considered, the unenhanced 3-T MRI-based imaging strategy was the preferred and dominant option over 3-T MRA and 1.5-T imaging (MRI and MRA). When the model was run without 3-T imaging as an option, 1.5-T MRA was the favored option. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the same preferred imaging strategy results. CONCLUSION. An unenhanced 3-T MRI-based strategy is the most cost-effective imaging option for patients with suspected SLAP tear. When 3-T imaging is not available, 1.5-T MRA is more cost-effective than 1.5-T MRI. The main driver of these results is the fact that 3-T MRI and 1.5-T MRA are the most specific tests in these respective scenarios, which results in fewer false-positives, prevents unnecessary surgeries, and leads to decreased costs. CLINICAL IMPACT. Our cost-effectiveness model findings complement prior diagnostic accuracy work, helping produce a more comprehensive approach to define imaging utility for radiologists, clinicians, and patients with SLAP tears who have access to various types of MRI options.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^111YqPcX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, arthroscopic stabilization provides good to excellent results in most cases of anterior shoulder instability. There is a subset of patients, however, with notable osseous lesions that remain at particularly high risk of recurrence and require open procedures for adequate stabilization. The literature has shown that anterior shoulder instability with less than 20% of glenoid bone loss can be treated arthroscopically in one form or another. For the subset of patients with 10% to 20% glenoid bone loss, however, there may be indication for supplemental or arthroscopic "plus", procedures such as the remplissage in the cases of an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion or double row capsulolabral repair in an attempt to recreate the normal anatomic labral insertion. For those with greater than 20% glenoid bone loss, however, there is an absolute indication for open stabilization — particularly with ORIF when possible and then open Latarjet procedure otherwise. Additional research is necessary to validate our recommendations. In particular, additional high-level studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of double row capsulolabral repairs in cases of glenoid bone loss. In addition, efforts should be made to limit the complications associated with the Latarjet procedure if we hope to provide it as a viable primary surgical option in cases of notable glenoid bone loss.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^116LfWCA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Traumatic shoulder instability is a common clinical entity in sports medicine, with a reported incidence of 1.7% in the general cohort. Some of the most salient risk factors for recurrent shoulder instability include younger age, male sex, and participation in collision sports. Recurrence of primary shoulder dislocations has been reported to be between 38% and 80% in the literature when managed nonoperatively. In one particular cohort study, young men recurred at the highest rate, 86.7% of the time. Nonoperative management has traditionally been advocated as initial treatment in all cases of shoulder instability. However, this idea has lost support because research has shown persistently high rates of recurrent shoulder instability with nonoperative management, particularly in people younger than 25 years. Surgery for primary dislocation has been shown to decrease the incidence of recurrent instability markedly in this same cohort. A number of patient-specific factors should be considered in each case; however, surgical management has become the mainstay of treatment for both primary and recurrent shoulder instability. Despite this relative consensus in favor of operative management, indications for the various surgical techniques continue to exhibit great heterogeneity from one surgeon to the next.

The surgical management of shoulder instability is not straight-forward. There are numerous patient-oriented and anatomic factors to be considered. Patient-oriented factors include age, level of activity, and the nature of sport participation (overhead sport, contact level, etc). The essential anatomic lesions of recurrent instability are (1) Bankart lesion (including Perthes, anterior labroligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion [ALPSA], and glenolabral articular disruption lesions), (2) capsular injury and laxity (including humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligament lesion), (3) Hill-Sachs lesion, and (4) glenoid dysplasia. Of these essential lesions, the size of glenoid bone defect (most commonly a bony Bankart lesion) has been most clearly associated with a high risk of recurrent instability. Studies have shown that a notable risk of glenohumeral instability occurs at close to 21% glenoid bone loss. Thus, much debate has emerged around the management of shoulders with notable glenoid bone loss. The spectrum of surgical techniques done for anterior shoulder stabilization is vast, but some of the common procedures today include the arthroscopic Bankart repair, Bankart plus remplissage, double row capsulolabral repair, Latarjet technique, and glenoid open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF).

### Surgical options for patients with shoulder pain [^114udJjH]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3–6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis as well as on the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical interventions for shoulder pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis.

### Management of the throwing shoulder: cuff, labrum and internal impingement [^116iZd8p]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Repetitive throwing or other overhead activity places great stress on the shoulder. As a result, the shoulder is a common site of injury in athletes. Addressing throwing-related injuries requires an understanding of throwing biomechanics and pathology. Nonoperative treatment is directed at restoring strength, flexibility, and neuromuscular control to the entire kinetic chain. Surgery is indicated when nonoperative treatment fails, and is directed at correcting labral, capsular, and rotator cuff pathology.

For patients with calcific tendonitis of the shoulder without a rotator cuff tear, nonsurgical options exist. When nonsurgical options fail, or when patients have a concomitant rotator cuff tear, arthroscopy is a safe and effective treatment.

optimally performed using magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA). Studies have shown the sensitivity of MRA to be between 82% and 100%, with a specificity of between 71% and 98%.

Tears of the superior labrum account for 80%–90% of labral pathology in the stable shoulder. These lesions were first described in 1990 by Snyder et al as superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tears. Originally SLAP tears were classified into four types (I–IV). Subsequently, lesion types V–IX were included in the classification as well. The most common mechanisms of injury include chronic, repetitive microtrauma secondary to overhead throwing-type movement or an acute fall onto the outstretched hand.

Treatment options for patients presenting with glenoid labral pathology include both surgical and non-surgical interventions. Previous work determined that the population incidence of SLAP repairs in years 2002 and 2009 increased from 3.54 to 10.89 per 100 000. Multiple reports document successful outcomes with operative repair of SLAP tears. Non-operative repair of SLAP lesions has also been associated with successful outcomes. Edwards et al reported significant improvements in pain, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL measure is increasingly used within orthopaedic research, as clinicians increasingly look beyond strictly functional outcomes to physical, psychological and social factors.

Unfortunately, there is not much information on the HRQoL associated with operative interventions of labral pathology. The incentive for this shift from a biomedical model to a psychosocial model has been influenced by research addressing the relationship to HRQoL and successful outcomes within a variety of orthopaedic disciplines, including labral and rotator cuff disease. It is the intent of this research to examine the outcomes and HRQoL between operative and non-operative groups in a cohort of patients with labral pathology. The research will also compare patients presenting with labral tears with those presenting with labral degenerations.

### Management of massive and irreparable rotator cuff tears [^112MHHuh]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Massive rotator cuff tears pose a distinct clinical challenge for the orthopaedist. In this review, we will discuss the classification, diagnosis, and evaluation of massive rotator cuff tears before discussing various treatment options for this problem. Nonoperative treatment has had inconsistent results and proven unsuccessful for chronic symptoms while operative treatment including debridement and partial and complete repairs have had varying degrees of success. For rotator cuff tears that are deemed irreparable, treatment options are limited. The use of tendon transfers in younger patients to reconstruct rotator cuff function and restore shoulder kinematics can be useful in salvaging this difficult problem.

### Surgery for rotator cuff tears [^114fchcn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews of interventions for shoulder disorders.

Objectives

To synthesise the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tears of the shoulder.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICRTP registry unrestricted by date or language until 8 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and assessing the effect of rotator cuff repair compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. As there were no trials comparing surgery with placebo, the primary comparison was rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression versus non-operative treatment (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Other comparisons were rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty versus rotator cuff repair alone, and rotator cuff repair and subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. Major outcomes were mean pain, shoulder function, quality of life, participant-rated global assessment of treatment success, adverse events and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included nine trials with 1007 participants. Three trials compared rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercise alone. These trials included 339 participants with full-thickness rotator cuff tears diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound examination. One of the three trials also provided up to three glucocorticoid injections in the exercise group. All surgery groups received tendon repair with subacromial decompression and the postoperative exercises were similar to the exercises provided for the non-operative groups. Five trials (526 participants) compared repair with acromioplasty versus repair alone; and one trial (142 participants) compared repair with subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. The mean age of trial participants ranged between 56 and 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. Symptom duration varied from a mean of 10 months up to 28 months. Two trials excluded tears with traumatic onset of symptoms. One trial defined a minimum duration of symptoms of six months and required a trial of conservative therapy before inclusion. The trials included mainly repairable full-thickness supraspinatus tears, six trials specifically excluded tears involving the subscapularis tendon. All trials were at risk of bias for several criteria, most notably due to lack of participant and personnel blinding, but also for other reasons such as unclearly reported methods of random sequence generation or allocation concealment (six trials), incomplete outcome data (three trials), selective reporting (six trials), and other biases (six trials). Our main comparison was subacromial decompression versus non-operative treatment and results are reported for the 12 month follow up. At one year, moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 3 trials with 258 participants indicates that surgery probably provides little or no improvement in pain; mean pain (range 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 1.6 points with non-operative treatment and 0.87 points better (0.43 better to 1.30 better) with surgery. Mean function (zero to 100, higher score indicating better outcome) was 72 points with non-operative treatment and 6 points better (2.43 better to 9.54 better) with surgery (3 trials; 269 participants), low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Participant-rated global success rate was 873/1000 after non-operative treatment and 943/1000 after surgery corresponding to (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.22; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Health-related quality of life was 57.5 points (SF-36 mental component score, 0 to 100, higher score indicating better quality of life) with non-operative treatment and 1.3 points worse (4.5 worse to 1.9 better) with surgery (1 trial; 103 participants), low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). We were unable to estimate the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events as only one event was reported across the trials (very low-certainty evidence; downgraded once due to bias and twice due to very serious imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

At the moment, we are uncertain whether rotator cuff repair surgery provides clinically meaningful benefits to people with symptomatic tears; it may provide little or no clinically important benefits with respect to pain, function, overall quality of life or participant-rated global assessment of treatment success when compared with non-operative treatment. Surgery may not improve shoulder pain or function compared with exercises, with or without glucocorticoid injections. The trials included have methodology concerns and none included a placebo control. They included participants with mostly small degenerative tears involving the supraspinatus tendon and the conclusions of this review may not be applicable to traumatic tears, large tears involving the subscapularis tendon or young people. Furthermore, the trials did not assess if surgery could prevent arthritic changes in long-term follow-up. Further well-designed trials in this area that include a placebo-surgery control group and long follow-up are needed to further increase certainty about the effects of surgery for rotator cuff tears.

### Outcomes in patients with glenoid labral lesions: a cohort study [^111paKBq]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Many published studies have demonstrated good to excellent outcomes of repairs of labral pathology. However, orthopaedic research is increasingly assessing results using HRQoL measures. In this particular patient population, the two groups were fairly homogenous regarding variables related to the injury, such as type of labral pathology, cause of injury, side of injury and symptom duration. However, the operative group was younger and had significantly worse baseline scores for pain VAS and ASES. These differences could be attributed to the guidelines and recommendations provided to physicians for determining whether a patient should elect operative or non-operative treatment. The patient who elected operative intervention experienced significantly improved long-term HRQoL outcomes and function scores. This trend held true after stratification by labral pathology, as operative patients consistently reported more favourable outcome scores after the 2-year follow-up period.

In this patient population, pain VAS was significantly higher in the operative group at baseline. However, there was evidence to support the efficacy of surgical intervention as these patients electing operative treatment displayed significant improvements from baseline to 2-year follow-up across all outcome measures. While the non-operative group also reported significant improvements in outcome measures, the operative group exhibited larger MDs from baseline to follow-up, as well as higher scores associated with better outcomes. Additionally, the reported raw 2-year follow-up scores were significantly higher/improved when compared with the non-operative group except for MCS and SAT.

Although numerous studies explicitly examine the functional outcomes following labrum repair, few studies look at the relationship between labral pathology and quality of life. The HRQoL outcomes for participants in the present study support previous research that has been conducted with non-operative patients. While the present study used the VR-12 as the HRQoL measure, studies that have used different HRQoL measures have reported similar results. Edwards et al found in non-operative patients that the SF-36, ASES and VAS scores all improved at final follow-up.

### Sham surgery versus labral repair or biceps tenodesis for type II SLAP lesions of the shoulder: a three-armed randomised clinical trial [^116Q6LkB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The superior glenoid labrum of the shoulder is a common site of injury and degeneration, which can cause both pain and disability. Snyder et al used the term SLAP (superior labrum anterior posterior) to describe a combined detachment of the long head of biceps tendon and the superior labrum from the glenoid rim (figure 1). The diagnosis is controversial; the validity of clinical tests, and even arthroscopy and MRI arthrography is questioned. In addition, a high prevalence of SLAP lesions has been reported in a middle-aged asymptomatic population.

Figure 1
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow chart. AC, acromioclavicular; SLAP, superior labrum anterior posterior.

Labral repair is the most common procedure to treat labral tears, but because of high rates of complications and poor outcomes, it has been suggested that indications should be narrowed. Recent reports show a decrease in the number of labral tears performed and a decrease in the age of the patients undergoing these operations. Release of the biceps tendon (tenodesis or tenotomy) is increasingly used as an alternativeto SLAP repairs in select patients, but the evidence for it is weak. One non-controlled study reported better results after tenodesis compared with labral repair, but no randomised trials have compared these procedures. Very little evidence about non-operative treatment for type II SLAP lesions was available when the present study was designed. Recent non-controlled studies suggest that non-operative treatment including graded exercise therapy is beneficial, and the postoperative rehabilitation in the present study followed those rehabilitation principles.

Our aim was to conduct a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to assess the clinical effectiveness of labral repair and biceps tenodesis in patients with a type II SLAP lesion.

### Minimum 10-year clinical outcomes after arthroscopic 270 ° labral repair in traumatic shoulder instability involving anterior, inferior, and posterior labral injury [^112GEi7k]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Of interest, labral tears can be typically classified into different categories based on location and extent of the lesions: anterior labral tears (Bankart lesions), posterior labral tears (reverse Bankart lesions), and SLAP tears. First described by Lo and Burkhartin 2005, triple labral lesions involve the anterior, superior, and posterior aspects of the glenoid, contrary to 270° labral tears, which present as an intact superior labral and biceps complex.

As shown by Mazzocca et al, arthroscopic repair of 270° labral tears is seen as an effective treatment option in the management of bidirectional shoulder instability. Furthermore, as stated by the senior authors (D.P.B. A.D.M.), an arthroscopic approach permits complete visualization of the glenohumeral joint allowing the repair of any concomitant injuries. Of interest, Mazzocca et al reported on 19 patients (20 shoulders) with traumatic 270° labral tears at a minimum 2-year follow-up and identified significant improvements in Rowe (59 to 92), ASES (76 to 93), Simple Shoulder Test (9 to 11), and Constant-Murley (73 to 95) at final follow-up. Similarly, satisfactory mean postoperative SANE and WOSI scores of 95 and 302 were demonstrated, respectively. Of these patients, 6 were included in this 10-year follow-up study.

To date, there are limited studies investigating clinical outcomes of traumatic 270° labral tears. Alpert et alexamined the outcomes and satisfaction in 13 patients with frank 270° labral tears at a minimum 2-year follow-up and reported good clinical results with a success rate of 85% and no revision cases. However, the results were observed in patients with primary atraumatic multidirection instability.

Despite identifying satisfactory long-term outcomes, the current study did not investigate return to play. Pounder et alidentified a 76% rate of return to sport after arthroscopic 270° labral repair at a mean follow-up of 42.2 months in their 25-patient cohort, which included 19 (76%) collision athletes. Fifteen patients (60%) returned to the same or higher level of sport. Interestingly, 1 patient in the original cohort was a starting safety in the National Football League, indicating the success that these repairs may have. However, this patient was lost to follow-up.

### Outcomes in patients with glenoid labral lesions: a cohort study [^116DYQvX]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background/aim

For patients presenting with glenoid labral pathologies, there is little information on how operative interventions affect long-term outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study evaluated outcomes in operative and non-operative patients presenting with labral tears versus labral degenerations.

Methods

Participants completed a pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons instrument, Scapular Assistance Test (SAT), Shoulder Activity Level, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation at baseline and at 6-month, 12-month and 2-year follow-ups. χ² and Student's t-test were used to test the differences between categorical and continuous variables. Analysis of variance investigated the differences between groups, and linear regression analyses explored the relationship of baseline characteristics with outcome scores.

Results

After 2 years, the operative cohort (n = 68) significantly improved in all measures. The non-operative cohort (n = 55) showed significant improvements in all scores except the mental component summary (MCS) and pain VAS. Labral tear patients (n = 52) within the operative group (n = 28) significantly improved in all measures except MCS. Non-operative labral tear patients (n = 24) indicated significant improvements in all measures except MCS, VAS and SAT. Labral degeneration patients (n = 71) within the operative group (n = 27) significantly improved in all measures except MCS and SAT. Non-operative labral degeneration patients (n = 44) indicated significant improvements in all measures except the physical component summary, MCS, VAS and SAT.

Conclusion

Patients who were surgically treated for labral tears or degenerations had significantly improved outcomes and HRQoL scores after 2 years compared with the non-operative cohort.

### Arthroscopic bankart repair: have we finally reached a gold standard? [^116sFXYW]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Traditionally, surgical stabilization of the unstable shoulder has been performed through an open incision. Arthroscopic Bankart repair with suture anchors is now widely considered the treatment of choice for anterior shoulder instability in patients who have failed conservative management. Many different factors have now been elucidated for adequate treatment of glenohumeral instability. Because of technical advances in instability repair combined with an increased understanding of factors that lead to recurrent instability, the outcomes following arthroscopic Bankart repair have significantly improved and approach those of open techniques.

### A mechanistic classification for superior labral injuries guides operative management [^115fgwsg]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide a clinically-oriented classification system for superior labral injuries based on etiology, pathoanatomy and associated biceps-labrum anchor complex injuries. The proposed classification system is based primarily on the mechanism of superior labral injuries as an ABCD classification (A; acute trauma, B; Bankart extension from instability, C; chronic repetitive overhead activity, and D; degenerative. The recognition of the cause is paramount to appropriately treating these patients, especially when considering operative treatment. Traumatic injuries include compressive loads, axial traction or torsional loading, and can additionally be secondary to shoulder instability events. Chronic overuse-related superior labral injuries typically occur with repetitive overhead activities, most commonly throwing mechanisms in athletes. Degenerative changes to the superior labrum are related to normal aging processes, and are often identified during evaluation and management of other conditions (e.g., rotator cuff tears). Superior labral anatomic variants may also be present that may alter labral loading. Non-operative management is often an appropriate and effective initial treatment for superior labral injuries, unless there are obvious pathologic changes altering the mechanics of the glenohumeral joint (large labral flap tears, bucket handle tears, etc.) or other associated injuries (traumatic rotator cuff tears, fractures, etc.). Surgical treatment principles include: 1) preserving normal mobility of the superior labrum/biceps tendon complex, 2) when detached, repairing the normally fixed inferior labrum anteriorly and posteriorly, 3) considering biceps tenotomy or tenodesis when pathologic changes extend in to the long head of the biceps tendon, 4) considering individual patient factors in each case. In addition to these general principles, the classification guides operative treatment.

### Editorial commentary: subpectoral biceps tenodesis is a safe alternative to arthroscopic repair for unstable SLAP tear in the young athlete: should we Do the last operation first? [^115mF4zM]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical significance of structural pathology affecting the biceps-superior labrum complex may be highly variable. Among younger, physically active patients with symptomatic superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears that have failed to respond to nonoperative treatment, we continue to lack clear high-level evidence to guide surgical decision making, including a decision between arthroscopic SLAP repair or primary biceps tenodesis for more unstable, type II lesions. Rates of patient satisfaction, return to play, return to prior level of activity, and secondary revision rate are widely reported, and we lack consensus for surgical best practice treatment. With the high rate of postoperative stiffness and revision reoperation and inconsistent functional outcomes after modern arthroscopic shoulder SLAP repair with knotless anchor technology, subpectoral biceps tenodesis may emerge as a primary alternative for treating the young athlete with unstable SLAP tears.

### Complex shoulder disorders: evaluation and treatment [^111EXvNX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Evaluation of patients with shoulder disorders often presents challenges. Among the most troublesome are revision surgery in patients with massive rotator cuff tear, atraumatic shoulder instability, revision arthroscopic stabilization surgery, adhesive capsulitis, and bicipital and subscapularis injuries. Determining functional status is critical before considering surgical options in the patient with massive rotator cuff tear. When nonsurgical treatment of atraumatic shoulder stability is not effective, inferior capsular shift is the treatment of choice. Arthroscopic revision of failed arthroscopic shoulder stabilization procedures may be undertaken when bone and tissue quality are good. Arthroscopic release is indicated when idiopathic adhesive capsulitis does not respond to nonsurgical treatment; however, results of both nonsurgical and surgical treatment of posttraumatic and postoperative adhesive capsulitis are often disappointing. Patients not motivated to perform the necessary postoperative therapy following subscapularis repair are best treated with arthroscopic débridement and biceps tenotomy.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112WUr5f]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Long-term non-operative management — physical therapy outcomes and recommendation strength: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) improve with physical therapy in symptomatic patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the rotator cuff tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration may progress over 5 to 10 years with non-operative management. Quality of evidence is High and the strength of recommendation is Strong. For patients treated non-operatively after a rotator cuff tear, surveillance with serial clinical evaluation and imaging may be considered if surgical repair remains a viable option.

### Outcomes in patients with glenoid labral lesions: a cohort study [^111fFjWU]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

VR-12 (MCS and PCS) scores were not significantly different at baseline between operative and non-operative groups. Despite observing an increased MCS score in both operative and non-operative groups, there was no statistical difference between 2-year MCS scores of either treatment group. Throughout this study, MCS consistently did not display significant improvements over time. This phenomenon is not fully understood, but can possibly be attributed to the nature of a repaired labrum. Previous research involving overhead athletes receiving non-operative treatments of SLAP tears found return to sport difficult to achieve, despite improvement in pain scores: 'Although 71% of patients returned to the same or better levels of participation, only 10 of the 15 overhead athletes (67%) returned to their overhead sport at the same or higher level'. Additionally, Cohen et al found that only 14 of 29 patients (48%) in their series could return to pre-participation levels after SLAP repair, and only 71% of patients were satisfied. This may suggest that patients in our population experienced less pain and higher PCS scores, but did not report increased MCS scores due to disappointing results when returning to sport or work.

Stratifying by labral pathology allowed a deeper look into the relationship between treatment and HRQoL. Among patients with labral tears, the two groups were fairly homogenous except for the operative group presenting significantly worse baseline scores for pain VAS and ASES. As previously mentioned, this difference is likely the result of physician guidelines and recommendations for patients presenting with higher levels of pain. In this population, only the operative group reported a significant improvement in pain VAS scores. Both groups displayed significant improvement in PCS scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up, with operative patients reporting a nearly statistically greater improvement in PCS scores. The efficacy of operative treatment of labral tears has been shown again, as operative patients displayed larger improvement in pain VAS, ASES, WORC and SANE scores when compared with non-operative patients.

### Two-year follow-up of a group-sequential, multicenter randomized controlled trial of a subacromial balloon spacer for irreparable rotator cuff tears of the shoulder (START: REACTS) [^113Jgxv4]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are a common clinical presentation, and although many tears are asymptomatic, a high proportion of people with a rotator cuff tear will go on to develop symptoms including pain and reduced function. Many people improve after nonoperative care including physical therapy, but some are treated surgically. Although rotator cuff repair is a well-accepted surgical treatment for tears, including massive cuff tears, some tears cannot be repaired. The treatment of irreparable tears is controversial, with numerous techniques proposed and few randomized trial data to determine which is most effective. Arthroscopic debridement, often including biceps tenotomy if the tendon is intact, is a common treatment, and case series suggest patient benefit. However, insufficient evidence from clinical trials is available, and it remains unknown whether arthroscopic debridement provides adequate benefit or whether other treatment options would be better.

In 2013, the InSpace subacromial balloon spacer device (Stryker, USA) was introduced into UK orthopaedic practice as a potential treatment option. It is a saline-filled balloon made of biodegradable (dissolvable) synthetic material and is inserted in the subacromial space, after an arthroscopic debridement has been performed. It cushions the humerus from pressing on the bone above it, the acromion, when the deltoid is active and during abduction of the arm, potentially improving the biomechanics of the shoulder and reducing pain. In May 2016, an interventional procedure guidance document was published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) demonstrating very limited evidence for use of the InSpace device. A research recommendation was made by NICE to assess its effectiveness.

We conducted a group-sequential, double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of a subacromial balloon spacer device for irreparable rotator cuff tears of the shoulder (START:REACTS) to investigate the efficacy of using the balloon device for people needing operative intervention for irreparable rotator cuff tears. In 2022, the START:REACTS primary results were published showing that participants allocated to debridement alone (control) had better outcomes at 12 months and that women had worse results with the balloon compared with men in prespecified subgroup analysis. We present the 24-month follow-up data here. We also conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate whether the observed differences between men and women are due to differences in shoulder size or baseline strength.

### Diagnosis and management of partial thickness rotator cuff tears: a comprehensive review [^117LSeJ3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Partial thickness rotator cuff tears (PRCTs) are a challenging disease entity. Optimal management of PRCTs continues to be controversial. Although advances in magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography have aided in early diagnosis, arthroscopic evaluation remains the benchmark for diagnosis. Conservative treatment is often the first line of management for most patients; however, evidence suggests that surgical intervention may limit tear progression and the long-term sequelae. Surgical decision making is driven by factors such as age, arm dominance, etiology, activity level, tear thickness, and tear location. Many surgical options have been described in the literature to treat PRCTs including arthroscopic débridement, transosseous, in situ repair techniques, and tear completion and repair. Biologic supplements have also become an attractive alternative to aid in healing; however, the long-term efficacy of these modalities is largely unknown. This article will provide a detailed review of the etiology and natural history of PRCTs, as well as diagnosis, and current management to guide clinical decision-making and formulate an algorithm for management of PRCTs for the orthopaedic surgeon.

### Nonoperative treatment of the biceps-labral complex [^1149rjEN]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The long head of the biceps and superior labrum should be evaluated as an interdependent functional unit. A focused patient history and physical examination including multiple provocative tests should be performed alongside advanced imaging studies to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Nonoperative treatment modalities including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoid injections, and a standardized physical therapy regimen should be exhausted before operative intervention. Significant improvements in pain, functional outcomes, and quality of life are achieved in patients treated nonoperatively. Although these outcomes are less consistent for overhead athletes, return to play and performance metrics seem comparable to those who undergo surgery.

### Shoulder arthroplasty: prosthetic options and indications [^11652n7r]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Glenohumeral arthropathy and failed shoulder arthroplasty can lead to debilitating pain, reduced motion and strength, and limited function. Primary osteoarthritis, posttraumatic osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cuff tear arthropathy, and osteonecrosis are common in this patient population. Shoulder arthroplasty may fail because of problems with the prosthesis, such as wear, loosening, and dislocation of the components, or because of bone and soft-tissue problems, such as glenoid arthrosis and rotator cuff tear. The disparate pathogenesis of these processes presents unique challenges to the treating surgeon and requires diagnosis-specific treatment options, whether involving hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Until recently, prosthesis options were limited to a stemmed humeral component with or without a polyethylene glenoid component. The array of prosthetic options currently available allows individualized treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of superior labrum anterior posterior lesions in overhead athletes [^115GKKAr]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain is a common complaint in overhead athletes, and superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions are a common cause of this pain. The pathological cascade which results in the SLAP lesion consists of a combination of posterior inferior capsular tightness and scapular dyskinesis, resulting in a 'peel back' phenomenon at the biceps anchor and leading to the SLAP tear. Physical exam tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity in detecting SLAP lesions, so MRI is helpful in demonstrating the anatomical alteration. Treatment can be conservative, with posterior inferior capsular stretching and scapular open and closed chain exercises. Many SLAP lesions in overhead athletes require surgical treatment that involves repair of the labrum back to the glenoid. Treatment of concomitant injuries such as rotator cuff tears and Bankart lesions in conjunction with the SLAP repair may be necessary.

### Editorial commentary: treatment of panlabral shoulder lesions: the circle concept revisited [^111GNjAr]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Shoulder instability is common in athletes. Combined labral injuries are also common and appear more frequently in chronic cases, suggesting propagation of smaller tears with each event. Panlabral tears, or 270 tears, represent an extreme form of this phenomenon. Arthroscopy has allowed for improved appreciation of these combined patterns. Although it is essential to fix all labral lesions identified during arthroscopy, it is also crucial to enter surgical cases with a clear diagnosis (i.e., anterior, posterior, or combined instability) to adequately address symptoms.

### Minimum 10-year clinical outcomes after arthroscopic 270 ° labral repair in traumatic shoulder instability involving anterior, inferior, and posterior labral injury [^113yXCqB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of this study was that patients undergoing 270° arthroscopic labral repair using suture anchors maintained excellent clinical outcomes at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. Moreover, this challenging cohort experienced significant improvements in pain and shoulder function as compared with the preoperative state, with low rates of recurrent instability, complications, and revision surgery. Furthermore, the data from this study suggest the long-term efficacy of these extensive repairs to restore mechanical stability to the glenohumeral joint.

Extensive labral lesions, such as traumatic 270° labral tears, are a rare and surgically challenging pathology. Biomechanically, glenohumeral instability is a spectrum of disorder, in which extensive labral lesions are the result of acute traumatic events and/or long-standing repetitive microtrauma. As such, traumatic 270° labral tears are characterized by labral tears to the anterior, inferior, and up to the midglenoid posteriorly with preservation of the superior labrum and biceps anchor. The extent of these injuries is often underappreciated on advanced imaging studies and physical examination, with some patients exhibiting unidirectional instability.

### Decision making for labral treatment in the hip: repair versus Débridement versus reconstruction [^111AjYzb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The role and function of the acetabular labrum have been studied extensively in the past decade. Recent studies have proposed that, in addition to causing pain and mechanical symptoms, labral tears may accelerate arthritis. Labral preservation is believed to be important because of the role the labrum plays in maintaining a healthy joint. Treatment of the acetabular labrum is becoming one of the fastest growing fields in orthopaedics; therefore, the treatment decision-making process must be refined. Currently, three commonly practiced labral treatments are available: repair, débridement, and reconstruction. Arguments for and against each treatment option exist in the literature. Reviewing the currently proposed indicators for labral tear treatments in conjunction with the treatment procedures yields a thorough decision-making guide for choosing the appropriate labral procedure.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^1163XBVa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and compare treatments (1) after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation aimed at minimising the risk of chronic shoulder instability and (2) for chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability.

Design

Intervention systematic review with random effects network meta-analysis and direct comparison meta-analyses.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, DARE, HTA, NHSEED, Web of Science) and reference lists were searched from inception to 15 January 2018.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised trials comparing any interventions either after a first-time, traumatic shoulder dislocation or chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, with a shoulder instability, function or quality of life outcome.

Results

Twenty-two randomised controlled trials were included. There was moderate quality evidence suggesting that labrum repair reduced the risk of future shoulder dislocation (relative risk 0.15; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.8, p = 0.026), and that with non-surgical management 47% of patients did not experience shoulder redislocation. Very low to low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation. There was low-quality evidence that an open procedure was superior to arthroscopic surgery for preventing shoulder redislocations.

Conclusions

There was moderate-quality evidence that half of the patients managed with physiotherapy after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation did not experience recurrent shoulder dislocations. If chronic instability develops, surgery could be considered. There was no evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgical management for post-traumatic chronic shoulder instability.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^1135ikFr]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will discuss the epidemiology of shoulder instability and propose a surgical treatment algorithm including consideration for the more common surgical procedures including arthroscopic surgery with a standard labral repair, arthroscopy with remplissage, double row repair, and indications for open procedures such as a Bankart repair with or without a concomitant humeral sided capsular shift and modified Latarjet. This algorithm, as supported by the literature, will add to previously existing knowledge on the indications for surgery in anterior shoulder dislocation with special attention paid to the varying degree of glenoid bone loss.

### Tissue anchor use in arthroscopic glenohumeral surgery [^116sGxT7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic surgery has become the mainstay of treatment of several common glenohumeral pathologies such as tears of the rotator cuff and labrum. Arthroscopic rotator cuff and labral repair provide outcomes comparable to those achieved with traditional open techniques, with the benefits of smaller incisions and less soft-tissue disruption. Development and improvement of tissue anchors and arthroscopic instrumentation has been integral to the increased popularity of arthroscopic glenohumeral repairs. Current anchors can be categorized by design and material composition. Awareness of the advantages and limitations of these implants may influence anchor selection.

Not all acetabular labral tears, tissue quality, and size are the same. There is still a role for selective debridement of the acetabular labrum when stable, functional labral tissue remains. An unstable labrum that appears very different than the rest of the labrum is an easy target for repair. Tears requiring resection require graft augmentation or reconstruction.

### Diagnosis and management of superior labral anterior posterior tears in throwing athletes [^1122939P]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Injury to the superior glenoid labrum is increasingly recognized as a significant source of shoulder pain and dysfunction in the throwing athlete. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) tears. The clinical examination of the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex remains challenging because of a high association of other shoulder injuries in overhead athletes. Many physical examination findings have high sensitivity and low specificity. Advances in soft tissue imaging such as magnetic resonance arthrography allow for improved detection of labrum and biceps tendon lesions, although correlation with history and physical examination is critical to identify symptomatic lesions. Proper treatment of throwers with SLAP tears requires a thorough understanding of the altered biomechanics and the indications for nonoperative management and arthroscopic treatment of these lesions.

### Outcomes in patients with glenoid labral lesions: a cohort study [^1117dzTw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients presenting with labral degenerations reported improvements in outcome scores. However, it is important to note non-significant improvements in pain VAS and PCS scores in patients receiving non-operative treatment. Operative patients reported significant improvements in these scores, further supporting surgical treatment of labral pathologies. While it may seem intuitive for a physician to treat a less severe lesion with a conservative approach, this stratified non-operative group displayed the smallest MD in scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up.

Study limitations include single-centre patient information, as well as smaller sample sizes after stratification. Additionally, the patient population was derived from patients presenting with rotator cuff pathology. Despite controlling for this variable, it may prove useful to investigate the effects of treatment on patients presenting specifically with labral pathology. Future research may include additional long-term trials evaluating HRQoL in patients choosing operative and non-operative treatment modalities.

The present study provides important information on expected outcomes in patients who receive operative or non-operative treatment for labral pathologies, and may help guide decisions on when to consider intervention types based on these criteria. Operative groups in this cohort consistently exhibited larger MDs for all outcome measures, and higher scores associated with better outcomes. This study demonstrates that patients who received operative treatment of labral pathology (either a tear or degeneration) significantly improved HRQoL and outcome scores after 2 years when compared with non-operative treatment.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of rotator cuff tears [^114Bnwnt]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Although rotator cuff tears may be asymptomatic, symptomatic tears have had treatment varying from nonoperative therapy and debridement with subacromial decompression to operative repair. The benchmark for comparison should be nonoperative treatment when deciding to proceed to operative repair. This review will analyze the recent peer-reviewed publications describing results of operative repair, how this regimen differs with nonoperative treatment, and any outcome differences between operative and nonoperative treatment. Operative repair has consistently shown a higher rate of pain relief in patients (85%) and a better return of strength. Nonoperative treatment is expected to produce satisfactory relief of pain in only 50% of patients and no improvement in strength at long-term follow-up.

### Minimum 10-year clinical outcomes after arthroscopic 270 ° labral repair in traumatic shoulder instability involving anterior, inferior, and posterior labral injury [^113LYv8g]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic 270° labral tears resulting in bi- or tridirectional instability are rare and complicated injuries, generally seen in competitive contact athletes. This pathology typically involves tears to the anterior, inferior, and up to the midglenoid posteriorly with preservation of the superior labrum and biceps anchor (Figure 1). In contrast, patients with triple labral lesions have arthroscopic findings demonstrating damage to the superior labrum and the proximal biceps complex.

Figure 1.
A 270° labral tear involves the anterior, inferior, and up to the midglenoid posteriorly with preservation of the superior labrum and biceps anchor. From Mazzocca et al. Reprinted with permission.

Panlabral tears account for only 2.4% of all labral tears, but they may be challenging for shoulder surgeons because of the extent of damage to the joint. Additionally, preoperative clinical examination and diagnostic imaging frequently miss 270° labral tears, potentially complicating the treatment and subsequent clinical outcomes.

Historically, surgical treatment of panlabral tears consisted of open inferior capsular shift or capsular plication to tighten the inferior capsule and reduce total joint volume.-, Over the past 20 tears, a trend has emerged toward arthroscopic procedures resulting in less postoperative pain and less surgical morbidity. As these labral lesions mostly cover 270° of the labrum, an arthroscopic approach allows complete visualization and repair of all labral pathology (Figure 2). So far, only 4 studies have reported on arthroscopic treatment of traumatic anterior, inferior, and posterior labral injury and these were limited to short-term follow-up.,

Figure 2.
Arthroscopic view demonstrates extensile labral repair using 6 anchors in a 270° labral tear. From Mazzocca et al. Reprinted with permission.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate, at a minimum 10-year follow-up, the clinical outcomes, complications, and recurrent instability in patients with 270° labral tears involving the anterior, inferior, and posterior labrum treated with arthroscopic stabilization using suture anchors. We hypothesized that patients undergoing 270° arthroscopic stabilization would maintain significant improvement in clinical outcomes at a minimum 10-year follow-up.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^114fCjf4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Arthroscopic Versus Open Bankart Repair

The open Bankart repair was once regarded as the benchmark procedure for anterior shoulder instability. Despite a shift toward arthroscopic stabilization procedures, the open Bankart repair remains a viable option with the appropriate indications. More recently, the addition of a concomitant capsular shift for capsular tightening has gained popularity. Studies comparing open Bankart repair with inferior capsular shift to arthroscopic Bankart repair continue to show a lower incidence of recurrent instability in the open procedure. The arthroscopic procedure, however, generally has the benefit of fewer postoperative range of motion limitations. There is no agreed on threshold for bone loss because it pertains to open versus arthroscopic surgery; however, as surgeons become more comfortable with arthroscopic procedures, there has been and will continue to be a natural decline in the number of open procedures.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114UEANe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability

There were no RCTs exploring the effectiveness of surgery versus non-surgical treatment, which is an important evidence gap. Open labrum repair appears to be more effective than arthroscopic labrum repair in successfully stabilising an unstable shoulder, while there was no difference in other outcomes or harms. The point estimate for the RR was 0.43; this means that arthroscopic technique was more than twice as likely to fail as open technique, and the NNH was approximately 12, defined here as a shoulder redislocation that would not have occurred if open technique had been used instead of arthroscopy. Previous meta-analyses, which have also included non-randomised studies, have suggested no difference between open and arthroscopic techniquesor a difference in favour of the open method. Although we have witnessed a rapid increase in the popularity of arthroscopy within the past two decades to the point of it being considered the accepted standard, our findings might justify a tempering of enthusiasm for the arthroscopic method. On the other hand, even though the perceived effectiveness of surgery might be overestimated since the natural course of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability is largely unknown, the results of surgery for chronic instability are encouraging in terms of the low redislocation rates after surgery in the included trials.

Study bias

The risk of bias among the included RCTs was relatively low. However, concern for confounding still exists, as there was considerable heterogeneity in the follow-up time and less than half (41%) of the studies used any kind of blinding. In most trials, the primary outcome was recurrent dislocation, a relatively 'hard' endpoint. However, in the included RCTs, the definition of redislocation varied from a solely symptoms-based diagnosis to one that was confirmed radiographically or alternatively, an event that required a manual reduction. Analysis on the effect of conflicts of interest or industry sponsorship on trial results was not possible due to heterogeneity.

### Superior labral tears of the shoulder: pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment [^113DAnHs]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Lesions of the superior glenoid labrum and biceps anchor are a well-recognized cause of shoulder pain. Advances in shoulder arthroscopy have led to improvements in recognizing and managing superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears. Recent biomechanical studies have postulated several theories for the pathogenesis of SLAP tears in throwing athletes and the effect of these injuries on normal shoulder kinematics. Advances in soft-tissue imaging techniques have resulted in improved accuracy in diagnosing SLAP tears. However, the diagnosis of clinically relevant SLAP tears remains challenging because of the lack of specific examination findings and the frequency of concomitant shoulder injuries. Definitive diagnosis of suspected SLAP tears is confirmed on arthroscopic examination. Advances in surgical techniques have made it possible to achieve secure repair in selected patterns of injury. Recent outcomes studies have shown predictably good functional results and an acceptable rate of return to sport and/or work with arthroscopic treatment of SLAP tears.

### Management of shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff… [^113cYhcw]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Treatment In patients with stage I impingement, conservative treatment is often sufficient. Conservative treatment involves resting and stopping the offending activity. It may also involve prolonged physical therapy. Sport and job modifications may be beneficial. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ice treatments can relieve pain. Ice packs applied for 20 minutes three times a day may help. A sling is never used, because adhesive capsulitis can result from immobilization. Therapeutic Injections Therapeutic injections are useful both because they are therapeutic and also because they can help the physician differentiate impingement from other problems. Indications for therapeutic injections include the following: Rotator cuff impingement that does not improve with conservative treatment, including NSAIDs and physical therapy.

Older patients with clearly operable lesions, such as subacromial spurs, who are not good surgical candidates. Frequently, older, poor surgical candidates can be helped with periodic injections. As a diagnostic technique. If a patient fails to improve following a subacromial space injection and has normal radiographs with an ambiguous physical examination, the rotator cuff may not be the problem. Thus, after the injection, repeat impingement testing will verify the diagnosis if the pain is ameliorated. 12–14 For temporary pain relief in a patient with an operable lesion. Although there are several entry points for shoulder injections, the posterior subacromial approach is perhaps the easiest. Furthermore, by angling the needle to the underside of the acromion, the physician can easily verify that the needle is properly positioned and, since the humeral head lies more anteriorally, there is no danger of hitting it.

It is important not to inject directly into the tendon and, if resistance to flow is encountered, the needle should be directed away from the site. Some potential weakening of the tendon can occur with injection directly into the rotator cuff. We recommend using 8 to 9 mL of lidocaine, 1 percent, mixed with 20 mg of triamcinolone or a similar amount of methylprednisolone, 20 mg per mL, or betamethasone, 6 mg per mL. The large volume floods the rotator cuff surface. A 1. 5-in, 22-gauge needle usually works well.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^112WfejP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There was an RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.8) for a recurrent dislocation after first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation in favour of labrum repair compared with physiotherapy. The certainty in the evidence was moderate. Forty-seven per cent of patients with a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation treated non-surgically did not experience a redislocation within 2 years.

What is already known on this subject?

After a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation, approximately half of patients developed recurrent shoulder dislocation within 2 years.
Some studies have shown promising results with surgery after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. Primary surgery has been advocated to prevent chronic shoulder instability.
Many patients with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability are offered stabilising surgery. Current practice favours arthroscopic labral repair over open surgery.

What this study adds?

There was moderate-quality evidence that patients who had labrum repair surgery after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation had lower recurrent dislocation rates than patients treated with physiotherapy. However, surgical treatment has a relatively high number needed to treat (2.5–5.6) to prevent redislocation.
In the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, effectiveness of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment is not known. Low-quality evidence supported open labrum repair over arthroscopic labrum repair.

### Editorial commentary: yet another arrow in the quiver for surgical treatment of the rotator cuff-deficient shoulder: will It fly fast and far or fall short like other options have? [^113UUpNV]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are common. When indicated, surgical repair is a highly successful procedure. There are circumstances when there is not enough tendon to perform an anatomic repair because of tear size, retraction, and/or atrophy. This clinical scenario, massive irreparable rotator cuff tear, has no perfect solution. Many options exist in treating massive irreparable rotator cuff tears: partial tendon repairs, debridement, tuberoplasty, intercalary allograft repairs, tendon transfers, superior capsular reconstruction, hemiarthroplasty, arthrodesis, and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. No superior technique has been described. Another treatment has been added to this list: inserting a biodegradable balloon within the subacromial space to reduce the articulation of the humeral head on the acromion and aid in recentering the humeral head to restore balance to the remaining rotator cuff and improve deltoid function.

Early surgery

Patients who underwent surgery to repair a labral injury (ie, Bankart repair) had fewer redislocations than patients who received non-surgical management or arthroscopic lavage of the glenohumeral joint at 1 year (four studies, 273 patients)(relative risk (RR) labrum repair vs non-surgical management 0.08; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27, p < 0.001 and labrum repair vs arthroscopic lavage 0.23; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67, p = 0.007, I² = 0%, p = 0.46) and 2 years (four studies, 243 patients)(RR labrum repair vs non-surgical management 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.8, p = 0.026 and labrum repair vs arthroscopic lavage RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.91, p = 0.037, I² = 63.6%, p = 0.064) (figure 2A, B; table 2). There was a benefit of arthroscopic lavage at 1 year over non-surgical management (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.86, p = 0.023) (figure 2A); this effect was not evident at 2 years of follow-up (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.14 to 3.68, p = 0.686) (figure 2B). Tests for inconsistency were insignificant at both time points. Direct meta-analysis was possible between studies comparing labrum repair and arthroscopic lavage (two studies, 160 patients). There was a treatment effect in favour of labrum repair (RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69, p = 0.02, I² = 54%, p = 0.14) (online supplementary appendix figure 1).

### Return to play following nonsurgical management of superior labrum anterior-posterior tears: a systematic review [^11518ZiQ]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears are common shoulder injuries, especially in overhead athletes. Often, initial management of these injuries is nonsurgical with focused rehabilitation. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the outcomes of nonsurgical management of SLAP tears in athletes.

Methods

A systematic review was performed for articles published before March 2021 using key search terms pertaining to clinical studies evaluating the nonsurgical treatment of SLAP tears in adult patients published in English-language literature. Abstracts and manuscripts were independently reviewed by 2 co-authors to determine eligibility. Return-to-play rate and return-to-prior-athletic-performance rate were determined by combining results across studies.

Results

Five articles met the inclusion criteria. There were 244 total athletes (162 elite or higher-level athletes). The mean ages ranged from 20.3 to 38.0 years. Type II SLAP tears were most common; baseball, softball, and weightlifting were the most common sports involved. The return-to-play rate was 53.7% in all athletes and 52.5% in elite or higher-level athletes. In athletes who were able to complete their nonoperative rehabilitation program, the return-to-play rate was 78% in all athletes and 76.6% in elite or higher-level athletes. The overall rate of return to prior performance was 42.6%, which increased to 72% for those athletes who were able to complete their rehabilitation. Patients who discontinued the rehabilitation protocol in favor of surgery had an average of 8 physical therapy sessions compared with 20 sessions for patients with successful nonoperative treatment. The timing of return to play was generally less than 6 months in studies that reported it. Patient-reported outcomes, including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score and visual analog scale, all improved significantly after nonsurgical treatment. Factors associated with failure of nonsurgical management included older age, participation in overhead sports (especially baseball pitchers), traumatic injury, positive compression rotation test, concomitant rotator cuff injury, longer baseball career, longer symptomatic period, and the presence of a Bennett spur.

Conclusions

Overall, nonoperative treatment of SLAP tears in athletes can be successful, especially in the subset of patients who are able to complete their rehabilitation program before attempting a return to play. Although nonoperative treatment should be considered the first line of treatment for most SLAP tears, there are some factors that may be associated with failure of conservative treatment; therefore, further high level, prospective studies would be beneficial to identify those athletes most likely to respond favorably to nonoperative treatment.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^117PgCaJ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Rotator cuff disorders remain the most common cause of shoulder pain and are among the most common reasons for patients to seek care in primary and specialty settings. Although operative and nonoperative treatments are offered to patients with atraumatic rotator cuff tears, there is a lack of evidence to support operative vs nonoperative treatment. This paucity of evidence has been highlighted by several professional agencies and experts.

Objective

To perform a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial, comparing pain and functional outcomes in patients undergoing operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears, and assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects by age and tear size.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Trial protocol of the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial. This pragmatic randomized clinical trial of an estimated 700 patients is adequately powered to accomplish its aims with 488 patients. Primary analysis will be conducted on an intent-to-treat population in the context of a mixed model. The multicenter trial started recruitment in 2018 with a 1-year follow-up duration. Patients aged 50 years or older to younger than 85 years with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed atraumatic rotator cuff tears that are suitable for either operative or nonoperative treatment will be enrolled. Block randomization will be performed and stratified by site, age, and tear size.

Intervention

Nonoperative treatment consists of an approximately 3-month standardized physical therapy program, whereas operative treatment consists of rotator cuff surgery followed by approximately 4 months of postoperative rehabilitation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome is patient-reported Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score, and the secondary outcome is American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Form score measured at 1 year of follow-up.

Discussion

The Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial is ongoing, and 12 sites with more than 40 physicians are currently recruiting patients. Although there is variation by site, as of May 2, 2019, 13% of all patients screened (787 of 6293) were eligible for the trial, and 9% of eligible patients (74 of 787) were recruited. Results of this study may help patients, clinicians, and policy makers assess the comparative effectiveness of operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears.

### Modelling the functional comorbidity index as a predictor of health-related quality of life in patients with glenoid labrum disorders [^112kFcmB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the USA, a high prevalence of shoulder dysfunction is associated with high societal cost and patient burden. In 2013, a reported 86 690 work-related shoulder injuries and illnesses involving days away from work occurred in the USA. In 2005, the treatment measures of shoulder pain accumulated to an estimated annual cost of $39 billion.

Glenoid labral lesions can often lead to significant discomfort and restriction during daily living activities, as well as various sporting activities. Labral pathology can be classified morphologically as torn, degenerated or blunted. The most common mechanisms of injury include chronic, repetitive microtrauma secondary to overhead throwing-type movement or an acute fall onto the outstretched hand. Diagnosis of these pathologies can be optimally performed using MR arthrography. The prevalence of these tears can vary from 6% in the general population to 35% in the sporting population.

Treatment options for patients presenting with glenoid labral pathology include both surgical and non-surgical interventions. Multiple reports document successful outcomes with operative repair of glenoid labrum tears (specifically superior labrum anterior posterior tears). Arthroscopic repair of these injuries can be performed with good postoperative outcomes and a low rate of recurrent labral injury. Non-operative repair of these same lesions has also been associated with successful outcomes.

Quality of life is a main outcome measure in orthopaedics due to the simple fact that most orthopaedic interventions do not increase a patient's life span, so survival is not a realistic outcome measure. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are increasingly used within orthopaedic research, as clinicians look beyond strictly functional outcomes to physical, psychological and social factors. These patient-reported outcome measures often include assessments of pain and the ability to perform daily activities, but many other qualities may be assessed as well, such as satisfaction and the ability to perform sporting activities.

The incentive for this shift from a biomedical model to a psychosocial model has been influenced by research addressing the relationship to HRQoL and successful outcomes within a variety of orthopaedic disciplines, including labral and rotator cuff disease. A growing body of literature over the past 30 years has investigated HRQoL with regard to orthopaedic patients presenting with shoulder pathologies, both at baseline and after surgical interventions. It is the intent of this investigation to determine a baseline model that is better able to predict improvement in HRQoL scores after 2-year follow-up in a cohort of patients with labral pathologies.

### Editorial commentary: proper indications for primary labral resection and reconstruction versus primary labral repair remain vague and undefined [^114ZL8u4]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary labral reconstruction for complex hip pathologies has shown outcomes and complication rates similar to those of labral repair. As surgeons become more proficient and versatile in their hip arthroscopy techniques, we are seeing increasing feedback supporting reconstructions in the primary setting. Patients with severe pincer impingement, hypotrophic labrums, labral ossification, or irreparable degenerative tearing demonstrate notable improvement and satisfaction after primary labral reconstruction. However, there still is benefit to retaining native labral tissue when feasible. Biomechanical studies show loss of suction seal and increased contact pressures with labral reconstructions versus repairs. Although primary labral reconstruction is a necessary skill and treatment option particularly for the complex hip, the pendulum may be starting to swing too far away from repairs or augmentations. Proper indications for primary labral reconstruction continue to evolve and are not yet black and white in the literature. Regardless, surgeons may rest assured that patients are demonstrating appropriate improvement and safety with either preferred surgical option.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^1164K8mA]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Unrepairable tears without arthropathy — risks and future research note that nonsurgical and surgical options remain available to patients with MIRCTs without arthropathy. Those patients who are directed towards the nonsurgical path may not experience appreciable improvement in pain relief and/or function impacting his/her quality of life including independence with ADLs. Each surgical option has distinct risks and potential outcomes which may not be acceptable to the patient, thus requiring additional surgical intervention/revision. Future research is required to evaluate long term outcomes comparing non-surgical versus surgical and surgical versus surgical modalities in this clinical setting.

### Posterior shoulder instability: a clinical review [^11124bn6]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Posterior shoulder instability has emerged as an increasingly prominent concern for surgeons treating shoulder pathology. Previously estimated to account for only 5% to 10% of cases in the general population, it is now recognized that the true incidence is likely underestimated. This growing recognition highlights the need for tailored treatment strategies. Surgical patients without osseous involvement can achieve successful outcomes with arthroscopic labral repair, while those with glenoid bone loss exceeding 13.5% may benefit from procedures designed to restore glenoid bone width.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^115jRw1U]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our review aimed to answer two patient-oriented questions relevant to clinical practice: (1) What are the best treatments to reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder instability after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation? and (2) How should the clinician best treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability? Evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of surgery versus non-surgical treatment is currently available only for a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation: early surgery led to fewer shoulder redislocations. However, approximately half of the patients primarily treated non-surgically do not experience a shoulder redislocation or develop shoulder instability within 2 years of the primary injury. Immobilisation in ER was not beneficial after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation compared with immobilisation in IR.

For the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, we did not identify any RCTs that assessed the effectiveness or efficacy of surgery versus non-surgical measures or sham surgery. Open Bankart repair produced more reliable results than the arthroscopic method for prevention of shoulder redislocations. There were no differences between other technical aspects of surgery.

Treatment after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation

Labrum repair was more effective than non-surgical treatment for first-time dislocation in terms of fewer redislocations. Arthroscopic lavage was no more effective at 2 years compared with non-surgical treatment, making arthroscopic lavage a candidate placebo surgical treatment in this context. Our NMA indicated a beneficial effect of labrum repair on the incidence of shoulder redislocation when compared with non-surgical treatment. The NNT — in this context the number of patients who needed to undergo surgery to prevent one patient having a shoulder redislocation — was 2.5–5.6 based on external dataand 2.0–4.7 based on the data in the included trials.

Regarding disease-specific quality of life, no meaningful meta-analysis was possible. There were some differences between the treatment alternatives in favour of labrum repair (online supplementary appendix table 5). Even though the differences were small, they were consistent with and explained by the reduced risk of shoulder redislocations and chronic instability in the groups treated with labrum repair.
