Fahr disease

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Fahr disease, specifically its definition, nomenclature, genetics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, and special considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and historical evolution. Then, I should verify the genetic basis and inheritance patterns. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and histopathology. After that, I need to review the clinical phenotype and epidemiology. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic criteria and imaging features. I will then consider the differential diagnosis, including secondary causes. Next, I should evaluate management strategies, including symptomatic care and investigational therapies. Finally, I will assess prognosis and highlight special considerations and controversies, making sure to double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and definition, because precision matters here. Historically, "Fahr's disease" referred to idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, but the modern preferred term is primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), reflecting the established genetic etiology in many cases, whereas "Fahr's syndrome" is reserved for secondary basal ganglia calcification due to identifiable causes such as endocrine disorders or infections [^57686d31] [^b8a8b258] [^a30fcb96].

> I need to check the genetic basis next. PFBC is genetically heterogeneous, with at least seven causative genes identified: SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1 with autosomal dominant inheritance, and MYORG, JAM2, and CMPK2 with autosomal recessive inheritance; however, known mutations account for roughly 19–47% of cases, indicating substantial undiscovered genetic contributors and true heterogeneity [^a30fcb96] [^e9926728] [^b8a8b258].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the converging pathophysiology. The leading model implicates neurovascular unit dysfunction with disturbed calcium–phosphate homeostasis, impaired endothelial function, blood–brain barrier disruption, and an osteogenic milieu with astrocyte activation, culminating in progressive calcification and neurodegeneration; CSF inorganic phosphate may serve as a biomarker in SLC20A2-related disease, supporting a phosphate-handling defect [^a30fcb96] [^b8a8b258] [^7af523d6].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype and epidemiology. Mean age of onset is typically in the 40s–50s, but presentation spans asymptomatic individuals to those with movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea), cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms; penetrance is incomplete and expressivity is variable, and prevalence estimates suggest PFBC may be underrecognized, with minimal prevalence around < 1/1,000 in some series, though other estimates range 2.1–6.6 per 1,000 when imaging and genetics are used, which I should treat cautiously given ascertainment differences [^57686d31] [^a30fcb96] [^0f12ca6b].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis rests on characteristic neuroimaging plus exclusion of secondary causes. Non-contrast CT is the gold standard, showing bilateral, symmetric calcifications in basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and subcortical white matter; MRI signal varies with calcium content and stage, and functional imaging (FDG-PET, DAT-SPECT) can reveal network dysfunction even when structural imaging is equivocal; genetic testing should be offered after metabolic workup excludes secondary causes [^31dfe049] [^9d63a28a] [^b4c66c69] [^11afc3ad] [^a30fcb96].

> Wait, let me verify the differential diagnosis and not conflate entities. Secondary causes to exclude include hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, mitochondrial disorders, infectious etiologies such as HIV or toxoplasmosis, and toxic or radiation injury; importantly, basal ganglia calcifications can also be seen in normal aging, so age-appropriate interpretation and correlation with symptoms are essential [^024585be] [^41e18b97] [^70b10c9b].

> Let me consider management, and I should confirm that no disease-modifying therapy is approved. Current care is symptomatic: levodopa for parkinsonism with variable response, antiepileptics for seizures, antidepressants or antipsychotics for psychiatric symptoms, and supportive rehabilitation; bisphosphonates such as etidronate are under investigation to target ectopic calcification, with ongoing trials like CALCIFADE, but evidence remains preliminary and not curative [^a30fcb96] [^0f12ca6b] [^edb83ffe].

> I should double-check prognosis and natural history. PFBC is progressive, with symptoms typically worsening over years, though the course is heterogeneous; early-onset or severe calcification correlates with greater disability, and vascular calcification may contribute to ischemic risk in some cases; given incomplete penetrance, presymptomatic or mildly affected relatives may have a more favorable outlook, but longitudinal data are limited [^a30fcb96] [^c0247894].

> But wait, what about special considerations and controversies. First, nomenclature remains inconsistent in older literature, so I need to explicitly distinguish PFBC from secondary Fahr's syndrome in discussions. Second, pediatric presentations occur and may be underrecognized, including reports of SLC20A2 deletions and early-onset calcifications, so age of onset should not exclude PFBC. Third, the "bicycle sign" has been cited as a red flag for atypical parkinsonism, yet cases of PFBC with severe freezing of gait but preserved cycling challenge its specificity, so I should caution against overinterpreting this sign in isolation [^57686d31] [^b10594d9] [^d077c4a2] [^d9955a7a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear: PFBC is a genetically mediated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral brain calcifications with a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations; diagnosis hinges on characteristic CT findings after excluding secondary causes, with genetic testing expanding yield; management is symptomatic and supportive, with investigational anti-calcification therapies under study; prognosis is variable but generally progressive, and early recognition with family counseling is essential for optimal care and cascade screening [^a30fcb96] [^b8a8b258] [^57686d31].

Fahr disease, now termed **primary familial brain calcification (PFBC)** [^57686d31], is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral basal ganglia calcifications [^a30fcb96] with movement disorders, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms [^b8a8b258]. It is **genetically heterogeneous**, most often due to SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, or XPR1 mutations, with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance [^a30fcb96] [^44f3ce33]. Diagnosis relies on CT/MRI showing symmetric calcifications and exclusion of secondary causes; genetic testing confirms PFBC [^31dfe049] [^a30fcb96]. There is **no disease-modifying therapy** [^a30fcb96]; management is symptomatic, and prognosis is progressive with substantial disability over time [^0f12ca6b].

---

## Clinical manifestations

PFBC presents with a **triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms** [^a30fcb96], with variable severity and age of onset [^b8a8b258]:

- **Movement disorders**: Parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea, ataxia, and dysarthria are common [^a30fcb96] [^44f3ce33].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Executive dysfunction, memory loss, and progressive dementia occur frequently [^a30fcb96] [^b4c66c69].
- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Depression, anxiety, psychosis, and personality changes are reported [^a30fcb96] [^9861cc7d].

---

## Genetic basis

PFBC is **genetically heterogeneous**, with identified causative genes and inheritance patterns:

| **Gene** | **Inheritance** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| SLC20A2 | Autosomal dominant | Most common |
| PDGFB | Autosomal dominant | Common |
| PDGFRB | Autosomal dominant | Common |
| XPR1 | Autosomal dominant | Less common |
| MYORG | Autosomal recessive | Less common |
| JAM2 | Autosomal recessive | Less common |
| CMPK2 | Autosomal recessive | Less common |

---

Mutations in these genes disrupt phosphate homeostasis and neurovascular integrity, leading to calcification and neurodegeneration [^a30fcb96] [^b8a8b258].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of PFBC is based on **clinical features, neuroimaging, and exclusion of secondary causes**:

- **Neuroimaging**: CT shows bilateral basal ganglia calcifications; MRI reveals calcifications with variable signal intensity [^31dfe049] [^9d63c28a].
- **Exclusion of secondary causes**: Hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, infections, and toxic exposures must be ruled out [^024585be] [^41e18b97].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies causative mutations and confirms diagnosis [^a30fcb96] [^e9926728].

---

## Pathophysiology

PFBC involves **calcium-phosphate dysregulation**, neurovascular unit dysfunction, and blood–brain barrier disruption, leading to calcification of basal ganglia, thalami, and cerebellar nuclei [^a30fcb96] [^b8a8b258]. Calcifications impair neural circuits, causing motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms [^b4c66c69].

---

## Treatment and management

There is **no disease-modifying therapy**; management is symptomatic and supportive:

- **Motor symptoms**: Levodopa, anticholinergics, and botulinum toxin may provide partial relief [^notfound].
- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics are used as indicated [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy help maintain function [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

PFBC is **progressive**, with symptoms typically worsening over time [^0f12ca6b]. Severity correlates with calcification extent and distribution [^notfound]. Most patients develop significant motor and cognitive disability, and life expectancy may be reduced in severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Secondary causes of basal ganglia calcification must be excluded, including:

- **Endocrine disorders**: Hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism [^024585be] [^41e18b97].
- **Infectious diseases**: HIV, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus [^024585be].
- **Toxic exposures**: Carbon monoxide, lead, radiation [^024585be].
- **Genetic syndromes**: Mitochondrial disorders, Cockayne syndrome, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome [^024585be] [^31dfe049].

---

Fahr disease (PFBC) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with bilateral basal ganglia calcifications, causing motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. It is **genetically heterogeneous**, with no curative treatment; management is symptomatic, and prognosis is generally poor [^a30fcb96] [^0f12ca6b].

Fahr's disease is a rare condition characterised by the presence of idiopathic familial bilateral basal ganglia calcifications, transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Diagnosis is based on clinical features of neuropsychiatric and somatic symptoms in conjunction with radiological findings. Our patient, a man in his early 50s, presented with pneumonia. History was significant for five admissions in the last 2 years for pneumonia and falls, with gradual cognitive and motor decline since his late 30s. Hypophonia, bradykinesia and dementia were noted on examination. CT of the brain revealed bilateral thalamic calcinosis, consistent with Fahr's syndrome. Further investigations and retrospective history taking, and similar radiological findings within first-degree and second-degree relatives with early deaths, transitioned the diagnosis from Fahr's syndrome to Fahr's disease. We present this case of Fahr's disease to emphasise the value of collaboration among multidisciplinary professionals to improve quality of care for such patients.

A 57-year-old man with a 5-year history of progressive left-sided rigidity and apraxia had extensive bilateral calcification of basal ganglia, centrum semiovale, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter on brain imaging. The case is an example of radiological Fahr's disease accompanying a clinical syndrome of corticobasal degeneration. Possible pathogenetic and nosological implications of this association are discussed.

Catatonia is a manifestation of several psychiatric disorders, but may also be secondary to a systemic medical condition. Fahr's disease is characterized by radiographic calcifications of the basal ganglia. While diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in Fahr's disease, few reports of catatonia in this condition exist. We present a case of psychosis and catatonia in a patient with Fahr's disease.

### Fahr's disease with an initial presentation of crescendo TIA [^c0247894]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 51-year-old man presented with vertigo, slurred speech and left facial droop. He had been previously diagnosed with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and had a prior lacunar infarct. Imaging showed heavy symmetrical calcification in the globus pallidus, frontal white matter and cerebellar dentate nuclei/deep white matter. The imaging was pathognomonic for Fahr's disease and diagnosis was confirmed when other secondary causes of hypercalcemia were excluded. Fahr's disease is a rare, autosomal dominant, neurological condition characterised by primary brain calcification. Patients present with progressive neurological and psychiatric symptoms; commonly, Parkinsonian movement disorders, seizures, headaches, dysarthria, cognitive decline, psychosis and personality changes. There is an association with intracerebral ischaemic events. This case supports a growing body of anecdotal evidence of this association and is the first in which crescendo TIA may be the initial presentation of Fahr's disease. Referral for genetic counselling and symptomatic relief for neurological symptoms are the main management strategies.

### Fahr's disease: an incidental finding in a patient of tubercular meningitis [^e4646fa7]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Fahr's disease, also known as idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, is a rare clinical entity characterised by bilaterally symmetric calcification of the basal ganglia. Most of the patients present with extrapyramidal symptoms, but the natural history, progression and treatment still remain unknown. We report a case of tubercular meningitis diagnosed by a cerebrospinal fluid examination with incidental findings of an extensive basal ganglia calcification on CT. CT of sibling, done to evaluate an episode of seizure, revealed strikingly similar calcification. Both these calcifications were due to Fahr's disease. The patient was treated with antitubercular and antiepileptic drugs. The patient fully recovered clinically and currently is seizure-free on antiepileptic treatment.

### Evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow in fahr disease with schizophrenia-like psychosis: a case report [^6b7c5aa6]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

We report the case of a patient with Fahr disease presenting with schizophrenia-like psychosis for whom a technetium Tc99 methyl cysteinate dimmer brain study was used to evaluate regional blood flow. A brain single photon-emission CT study showed increased cerebral blood flow to the bilateral temporal lobes. Such perfusion abnormalities may reflect psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and delusions, which suggests a disruption of the cortico-subcortical neural circuits in psychosis.

### Genetic heterogeneity in familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (fahr disease) [^b08c937e]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC, Fahr disease) is an inherited neurologic condition characterized by basal ganglia and extra-basal ganglia brain calcifications, parkinsonism, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The authors examined six families for linkage to the previously identified genetic locus (IBGC1) located on chromosome 14q. The authors found evidence against linkage to IBGC1 in five of the six families supporting previous preliminary studies demonstrating genetic heterogeneity in familial IBGC.

### PET findings and neuropsychological deficits in a case of fahr's disease [^b4c66c69]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

In a case of Fahr's disease with frontal lobe type dementia and hyperkinetic-hypotone syndrome, functional changes were investigated using positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer. Computed tomography showed bilateral calcifications in the putamen and globus pallidus consistent with the diagnosis of Fahr's disease and a frontally pronounced brain atrophy. In contrast, reduced glucose uptake in PET was not only confined to the areas mentioned above, but extended to the temporal and parietal cortices, bilaterally. These functional changes corresponded to the neuropsychological deficits observed, i.e. disturbed selective attention and cognitive flexibility, verbal perseverations, and declarative memory deficits. It is suggested that functional changes may precede cerebral atrophy in Fahr's disease and may reflect deficits in functional circuits, which involve both the basal ganglia and the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.

### Fahr's disease: bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification in two brothers with two distinct presentations [^18ce4bbf]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis, commonly known as Fahr's disease is a rare clinical entity present mainly with extrapyramidal signs and accompanied with metabolic, biochemical, neuroradiological and neuropsychiatric situations. It is characterised by the symmetrical and bilateral intracranial deposition of calcium associated with cell loss in the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In this study, we discussed two brothers' cases of Fahr's diseases who presented with different symptomatology. The first presented with walking difficulty, cramps and dysarthria and moderate memory impairment whereas the second with vertigo, ataxia, forgetfulness and headache. CT scans of both patients revealed intracranial diffuse bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. The second patient revealed progressive cerebral atrophy but reduction in the calcification. Fahr's disease, although encountered rarely, should also be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of cases with abnormal intracranial calcifications along with other familial, congenital and metabolic diseases and syndromes.

### Basal ganglia calcification:' fahr's disease' [^b8a8b258]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Brain calcification is often detected incidentally, but basal ganglia calcification has a wide differential diagnosis, including genetic and acquired causes. Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) (formerly 'Fahr's disease') refers to neurological disorders characterised by bilateral, symmetrical deposition of calcium-hydroxyapatite crystals in the basal ganglia and other encephalic regions, with a presumed genetic basis. Its clinical picture encompasses motor, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations in various combinations. Seven genes have been linked to PFBC since 2012, with either autosomal dominant (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB and XPR1) or recessive (MYORG, JAM2 and NAA60) mode of inheritance. Mendelian gene discovery has provided critical insights into the pathogenesis of PFBC. Dyshomeostasis of inorganic phosphate, impaired endothelial functions and disrupted blood-brain barrier integrity has been identified as converging pathomechanisms, which could highlight the targets of potential disease-modifying treatments. We provide a state-of-the-art overview on phenotypic features, diagnosis, aetiopathogenesis and management of PFBC.

### Relevance of early intervention in fahr's disease: understanding through a case study [^19f09d7b]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Intracranial calcification may result from disturbances in calcium metabolism. It often remains asymptomatic, but may present with symptoms like seizure and neurological deficits. Correction of the underlying metabolic disturbance before damage of neuronal tissues due to intracranial calcification may be useful in preventing irreversible neurological deficits. This window period may be the crucial period that needs a thorough clinical evaluation and urgent intervention. We highlight the case of an adult woman with Fahr's disease presented with generalised tonic-clonic seizure. The management priorities were also discussed along with review of literature.

### Franz volhard and theodor fahr: achievements and controversies in their research in renal disease and hypertension [^661bdb79]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The clinician, Franz Volhard, and the pathologist, Theodor Fahr, worked closely together in Mannheim from 1909 until 1915 and introduced a novel classification of renal diseases. In the monograph entitled 'Die Bright'sche Nierenkrankheit, Klinik, Pathologie und Atlas' (1914) they differentiated between degenerative (nephroses), inflammatory (nephritides) and arteriosclerotic (scleroses) diseases. Nephrosclerosis was divided into the benign and malignant form, of which the latter stood the test of time as a new disease entity. Fahr further divided benign nephrosclerosis into the compensated and decompensated form — depending on the presence or absence of glomerular injury. In the pathogenesis of malignant nephrosclerosis, Volhard stressed the decisive role of severe blood pressure elevation, while Fahr postulated an inflammatory mechanism, a concept later confirmed by Adalbert Bohle for at least a minority of patients. A very far reaching concept of Franz Volhard was his idea that pale (renal) hypertension results from a pressor substance released from ischaemic kidney(s) contributing — via a vicious circle — to a further rise in blood pressure with subsequent renovascular injury and aggravation of hypertension. This hypothesis was supported in 1930 by initial experiments of his collaborator, Hartwich (demonstrating in dogs a mild rise in blood pressure after ligation of branches of the renal artery) and definitively proven by Goldblatt (1934) in dogs by induction of severe and persistent hypertension after clamping of both renal arteries. The consequent detection of the renin angiotensin system was the final confirmation of Volhard's postulated renal pressor substance. In the pathogenesis of red (essential) hypertension, Volhard stressed the role of hereditary factors, age, obesity and potentially of severe alcoholism. He emphasised a premature reduction of vascular distensibility (due to elastosis of the prearterioles), a high cardiac output as well as a dampening of baroceptor function. Additionally, Volhard made crucial advances in cardiology and pneumology. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001) 15, 5–16

### The clinical and genetic spectrum of primary familial brain calcification [^a30fcb96]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), formerly known as Fahr's disease, is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by bilateral progressive calcification of the microvessels of the basal ganglia and other cerebral and cerebellar structures. PFBC is thought to be due to an altered function of the Neurovascular Unit (NVU), where abnormal calcium-phosphorus metabolism, functional and microanatomical alterations of pericytes and mitochondrial alterations cause a dysfunction of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the generation of an osteogenic environment with surrounding astrocyte activation and progressive neurodegeneration. Seven causative genes have been discovered so far, of which four with dominant (SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, XPR1) and three with recessive inheritance (MYORG, JAM2, CMPK2). Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic subjects to movement disorders, cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances alone or in various combinations. Radiological patterns of calcium deposition are similar in all known genetic forms, but central pontine calcification and cerebellar atrophy are highly suggestive of MYORG mutations and extensive cortical calcification has been associated with JAM2 mutations. Currently, no disease-modifying drugs or calcium-chelating agents are available and only symptomatic treatments can be offered.

### Relevance of early intervention in fahr's disease: understanding through a case study [^91709189]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed in our patient on the basis of low-serum ionic calcium and high phosphate levels. There is a need to intervene in this critical period in order to prevent damages to the neuronal tissue of the brain due to metastatic calcification resulting from disturbances of calcium metabolism. This window period may be the crucial period that needs an intensive clinical evaluation and urgent intervention. Correction of underlying metabolic disturbance before damage of neuronal tissue due to intracranial calcification may be useful in preventing irreversible neurological deficits.

### Cerebellopontine calcification: a new entity of idiopathic intracranial calcification? [^56c616a8]. Acta Neuropathologica (2005). Low credibility.

We report the autopsy case of a 40-year-old woman with severe intellectual and motor disabilities, who showed calcification in the cerebellum and pons but not in the basal ganglia on CT scan, and died of intracranial hemorrhage due to intractable hypertension. At autopsy, numerous calcium deposits were noted in the cerebellar cortex, the dentate nucleus, the cerebellar white matter and the ventral pons. These deposits were distributed both in the neuropil and the white matter, but rarely within the arterial walls or in contact with capillaries. This weak relationship between calcification and the blood vessels, in addition to the paucity of basal ganglia calcification, is in contrast to the findings with other disorders involving intracranial calcification, including Fahr's disease and calcium metabolism disorders. Immunohistochemistry revealed intense staining of calbindin-D28K and parvalbumin at sites of calcium deposits both in the present case and in a case of pseudohypoparathyroidism, whereas these proteins were not localized to calcium deposits in the cerebellum of a Fahr's disease brain. We propose that the present case may represent a distinct entity among diseases characterized by idiopathic intracranial calcification. In addition, calcium-binding proteins may be involved in the calcification process in some cases with intracranial calcification.

### Relevance of early intervention in fahr's disease: understanding through a case study [^024585be]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physiological intracranial calcifications often remain asymptomatic, detected incidentally by CT scans. It occurs in approximately 0.3%–1.5% of cases. Such calcifications are usually benign but may be caused by underlying pathology. The most common causes of pathological basal ganglia calcifications are hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Other causes include pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, familial idiopathic cerebral calcification (Fahr's syndrome), birth anoxia, carbon monoxide intoxication, lead poisoning, methotrexate therapy, Hastings-James syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis, encephalitis caused by measles and chickenpox, Parkinsonism, vascular disease, radiation, Cockayne syndrome, post-infectious, AIDS (especially in children), Kearns-Sayre syndrome and other mitochondrial diseases, familial encephalopathies and Down's syndrome.

Fahr's disease refers to a condition characterised by bilateral basal ganglia calcification. In Fahr's disease, there also occurs calcification of dentate nucleus. The most common manifestation in Fahr's disease is development of Parkinsonian features (extrapyramidal symptoms like hypokinesia, rigidity and tremor)and cognitive impairment. We present a case of an adult woman with Fahr's disease presented with generalised tonic-clonic seizure without any other neurocognitive impairment.

### Elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and the pathomechanism of calcification in fahr's disease [^8a6c310c]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In this study, we report the case of a 68-year-old man complaining of involuntary movement of his left shoulder and lower jaw plus dyspnea. On cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, marked and symmetrical calcification at the basal ganglia and dentate nuclei was documented. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate level was confirmed by spinal tap examination and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The raised CSF lactate level, clinical characteristics such as diabetes, bilateral hearing loss and symmetrical cerebral calcification strongly suggested some kinds of mitochondrial disease. However, gene analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes revealed no typical or known mutations. Under the diagnosis of Fahr's disease, we treated him with haloperidol, which completely abolished his symptoms. In Ellsworth-Howard test, he showed markedly decreased phosphaturic response to parathyroid hormone with same pattern as type 2 pseudohypoparathyroidism. This abnormal response in our patient, probably due to respiratory alkalosis reflecting chronic hyperventilation, might in part explain similar mechanism of ectopic calcification underlying these two diseases.

### Imaging of bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis [^9d63a28a]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Bilateral symmetric striopallidodentate calcinosis, also known as Fahr's disease, is characterized by bilateral calcifications of the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, and the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere. Intracranial calcifications are easily visible as high-density areas on computed tomographic images. On magnetic resonance images, the calcifications exhibit different signal intensities. The differences in signal intensity are thought to be related to the stage of the disease, differences in calcium metabolism, and the volume of the calcium deposit. The moderate reduction of cerebral blood flow in bilateral thalami was also identified using brain SPECT.

### Pediatric idiopathic basal ganglia calcification and spherocytosis with chromosome 8p11 deletion [^b10594d9]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), also known as Fahr disease, is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of extensive parenchymal and vascular calcifications in the basal ganglia, with variable calcifications elsewhere in the brain. Typically, IBGC presents with neurologic and psychiatric symptoms in middle-aged adults. Recent genetic studies have identified alterations in 4 genes causing IBGC, including alterations in SLC20A2 on chromosome 8p11.2. Currently, there are no clinical descriptions of patients with IBGC occurring within the context of a complex genetic syndrome. Here, we present a case of pediatric 8p11 deletion with IBGC, hereditary spherocytosis, vitreoretinopathy, and focal cortical dysplasia. We review multiple cases of IBGC with pediatric onset due to SLC20A2 deletion in the literature, and raise the consideration of IBGC in the evaluation of pediatric patients with 8p11.2 deletion syndromes.

### Ability to cycle despite severe freezing of gait in atypical parkinsonism in fahr's syndrome [^d077c4a2]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Here, we report a patient with atypical parkinsonism and severe FOG who, nonetheless, has a negative bicycle sign, which has been suggested to distinguish patients with PD from atypical parkinsonism. This case suggests that this sign should be used with some caution in this regard. It remains unclear why, in some patients, there is a dissociation between severe difficulty with generating leg movements while walking, manifesting as FOG, and preserved ability to generate leg movements while cycling, although some possible suggestions have been made. For example, the action of cycling might represent a type of an external pacing cue that helps to overcome freezing. Another notable aspect is that the speed of leg movements seems to improve when cycling. This is not simply an improvement related to the "on" state in PD patients, as this was also observed in our patient who had a normal DAT scan and little response to-dopa. The improvement may be related to "paradoxical kinesia", a brief, sudden period of mobility in response to stress or life-threatening events.

The bicycle sign has been suggested as a new red flag for distinguishing PD from atypical parkinsonism. One issue with the previous report is that the atypical parkinsonian patients, taken together as a group, were significantly older and more impaired in terms of UPDRS, postural instability, and ataxia than PD patients. It is unclear whether patients in the earlier stages of atypical parkinsonian conditions also lose the ability to cycle. In conclusion, here, we demonstrate a patient with atypical parkinsonism and marked FOG resulting from Fahr's syndrome with a perfectly preserved ability to cycle 7 years after disease onset. We suggest that the bicycle sign should be used with caution as a red flag to distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism.

### Treatment of ectopic calcification in fahr's disease or syndrome… [^0f12ca6b]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Fahr's disease or syndrome are neurodegenerative diseases in which patients present with bilateral vessel associated calcifications in the basal ganglia. The clinical penetration of Fahr's disease or syndrome is incomplete and heterogeneous comprising of neuropsychiatric signs, cognitive decline, movement disorders, and various other signs. The symptoms start between 30 and 50 years and are progressive. Symptomatic patients have an increased risk for dependence in activities of daily living and impaired quality of life. Fahr's disease, scientifically known as primary familial brain calcification, is a neurodegenerative disease in which all patients present with bilateral vessel associated calcifications in the basal ganglia in the absence of other secondary causes of brain calcifications. When a secondary cause is identified, the term Fahr's syndrome is often used.

Recessively inherited PFBC is associated with mutations in two genes; myogenesis-regulating glycosidase and junctional adhesion molecule 2. Mutations in the known genes account for half of patients, suggesting genetic heterogeneity, with new genes yet to be discovered. The estimated minimal prevalence in studies with PFBC diagnosed with genetic and imaging studies is 2. 1 to
6. 6 per 1, 000 suggesting that PFBC is actually not a rare disorder and is underdiagnosed. The clinical penetration of Fahr's disease or syndrome is incomplete and heterogeneous comprising of neuropsychiatric signs, cognitive decline, movement disorders and various other signs. The symptoms start between 30 and 50 years and are progressive. Symptomatic patients have an increased risk for dependence in activities of daily living and impaired quality of life.

Histology shows small vessel and capillary calcifications, vascular insufficiency and blood-brain barrier damage. Neural pathology has been described and there are indications that calcifications could interfere with neural circuitry. It is not known how mutations in different genes lead to a common pathology. Yet PFBC belongs to a group of genetic diseases that due to different types of faulty phosphor metabolism leads to a shortage of inorganic pyrophosphate.
- The presence of a pathogenic mutation in one of the PFBC-related genes is supportive for the clinical diagnosis of PFBC.

### Genetics of RA susceptibility, what comes next? [^10d535de]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence is now emerging that the variants most strongly associated with autoimmune disease (lead SNPs) are enriched in areas of the chromosome that; are open and active, are defined by epigenetic marks, regulate gene transcription, and act in a cell-specific manner. Indeed, a recent study of 21 autoimmune diseases by Farh et al, described an enrichment of putative causal SNPs in immune-cell enhancers. The majority (∼60%) of these SNPs, associated with RA and 20 other autoimmune diseases, map to enhancer elements that are active in lymphoblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages. The RA-associated enhancers are enriched for; cell specificity (T and B cells), activity in response to stimulation, and size (large 'super-enhancers'). Furthermore, they are associated with the expression of non-coding RNAs (enhancer-derived RNAs, eRNAs also known as elncRNAs). This was shown to be true within the subset of RA-associated super-enhancers in the analysis by Farh et al, but is best illustrated by Hnisz et al in one of the first papers to describe super-enhancers. Super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancer elements that play a key role in defining cell identity and are associated with a 24.3-fold enrichment of RNA, compared to typical enhancers. Fahr et al found a 3.2-fold enrichment of RA SNPs in super-enhancers compared to typical enhancers and speculated that these SNPs could elicit subtle and stimulation specific changes in gene expression. Defining the function of these ncRNA expressing regions will be pivotal if we are to translate GWAS findings into mechanisms of susceptibility.

### The clinical and genetic spectrum of primary familial brain calcification [^57686d31]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by bilateral calcium deposition in the basal ganglia, with possible additional involvement of the cerebellar dentate nuclei, thalami, subcortical white matter, cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Mean age of clinical onset is around 40–50 years and estimated prevalence is < 1/1.000.

PFBC was formerly known as Fahr's disease, after the name of the German neuropathologist Karl T. Fahr who described in 1930 an elderly patient with dementia, motor problems and post-mortem detection of extensive calcium deposition in basal ganglia, striatum and white matter probably due to calcium-phosphorus abnormalities. However, basal ganglia calcifications in a man with tremor, rigidity and lower legs weakness had already been reported on autopsy in 1850 by Delacour. A possible genetic aetiology was postulated in 1977, when Boller reported a family with nine affected subjects with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Several different terms have been used to describe this nosological entity, including Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcifications (IBCG) and bilateral striato-pallido-dentate calcinosis (BSPCD). The term PFBC, which has replaced the term "Fahr's disease/syndrome", was introduced in 2013 and applies to cases of calcium deposition in the central nervous system with a genetic aetiology and is now used in view of the genetic advances of the last ten years in this field.

### Ability to cycle despite severe freezing of gait in atypical parkinsonism in fahr's syndrome [^d9955a7a]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

The retained ability to cycle despite freezing of gait (FOG) has been reported to be typical of patients with PD, and the "bicycle sign" (i.e. the loss of the ability to cycle) has been suggested as a red flag indicative of atypical parkinsonism. However, we present here a patient with Fahr's syndrome and severe FOG, but a remarkably preserved ability to cycle 7 years after disease onset. Fahr's syndrome encompasses a group of neurodegenerative disorders associated with calcification of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and other brain regions. Parkinsonism with FOG and early falls are part of the clinical phenotype of this disorder.

This 57-year-old patient developed difficulty walking with falls at the age of 53, followed swiftly by stuttering, erectile dysfunction, and urinary urgency. There was no relevant family history. On examination, he had hypomimia, festinant speech, echolalia, and scanning dysarthria. There was bilateral, but asymmetrical, bradykinesia and rigidity, intermittent rest tremor and bilateral postural arm tremor, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. He had marked FOG and tended to festinate backward on the pull test (see Video, Segment 1). The Mini–Mental State Examination was 25/30. A CT brain scan showed widespread calcification within the basal ganglia and dentate nuclei consistent with Fahr's syndrome. Extensive investigation showed no other abnormalities, and a dopamine transporter (DAT) scan was normal. He was treated with levodopa (-dopa) with a mild improvement of his symptoms. The patient reported that despite the marked FOG, he could get around his local village by cycling with no difficulty (see Video, Segment 2).

### Histology and computed tomography of incidental calcifications in the human basal ganglia [^fc26fecf]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first radiological description of basal ganglia calcifications dates from 1924. Nowadays, calcifications in the basal ganglia are most often detected incidentally during computed tomography (CT) scanning of the brain and have a prevalence of 0.32–38%. These calcifications are usually considered innocent, although they may be associated with diabetes and psychotic symptoms. Patients with Fahr disease, who have severe basal ganglia calcification, suffer from movement disorders, cognitive disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. This suggests that basal ganglia calcifications may not be so harmless. In case reports of patients with Fahr disease, the calcifications occurred in capillaries and the tunica media of arterioles and small- and medium-caliber arteries, with large arteries and veins sometimes showing complete calcification of the vessel wall. To our knowledge, there is one neuropathological study describing the histological nature of incidental basal ganglia calcifications in patients who did not have Fahr disease but who had a neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, or Parkinson's disease. The study described three patterns of calcification: deposits within the tunica media, deposits in the parenchyma, and deposits along capillaries. Calcifications in the internal elastic lamina and tunica media are usually non-atherosclerotic in origin, in contrast to calcifications of the tunica intima, and are associated with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

We investigated the histological nature of incidental basal ganglia calcifications and whether histological findings are associated with CT findings.

### Seizures and hypoparathyroidism post-thyroidectomy: fahr's syndrome [^606c30a7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Fahr's syndrome is a rare neurological condition marked by unusual calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, often resulting from metabolic disorders, such as hypoparathyroidism. Secondary hypoparathyroidism, a frequent complication of total thyroidectomy, can lead to Fahr's syndrome, manifesting as movement disorders, seizures, psychiatric symptoms and indications of calcium deficiency. This case report discusses a woman in her mid-30s who developed Fahr's syndrome due to secondary hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. She exhibited signs of calcium deficiency and had a history of seizures diagnosed a few years postsurgery, without any movement disorders or psychiatric symptoms. Her lab results showed low calcium levels, elevated phosphate and high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Imaging revealed bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia, dentate nucleus and cerebral hemispheres. Treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, calcitriol and thyroxine significantly improved the patient's symptoms. This case underscores the necessity of monitoring calcium and phosphate levels in patients after thyroidectomy and highlights the possibility of Fahr's syndrome presenting solely with seizures. The early detection and diagnosis of this condition are crucial for preventing further neurological damage and enhancing patient outcomes.

### Relevance of early intervention in fahr's disease: understanding through a case study [^4d6f86e7]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient had only symptoms of seizures (generalised tonic-clonic type) which might be the manifestation of intracranial calcification. Her distress was a psychological reaction to persistent seizures. Phenytoin was partially effective in controlling the seizure. Treatment with valproate resulted in good control of seizure. Basal ganglia has important role in motor control. Dysfunction or damage to the integrity of basal ganglia manifests with features of Parkinson's disease. Our patient did not show any sign or symptom of Parkinson's disease despite calcification of bilateral basal ganglia.

Basal ganglia calcification in our patient was associated with calcifications in cerebellar hemispheres and frontal lobe. The patient did not exhibit any other symptoms clinically, other than the episodes of seizure. A study revealed that calcification of basal ganglia correlated with the duration of hypocalcaemia. As hypocalcaemia and intracranial calcification were detected simultaneously in our patient, when she presented to us with seizures, the above correlation could not be established in our patient.

Disturbances in calcium metabolism may cause metastatic calcification, where calcium is deposited in healthy tissues causing its damage. Evidence suggests that interventions done before tissue damage may protect the tissue and preserve their structural and functional integrity. It seems that the disturbance of calcium metabolism in our patient had unlikely resulted in irreversible tissue damage causing the features of Parkinsonism or cerebellar dysfunction. This is the key time for the prevention of tissue damage through appropriate interventions.

Our patient had presented with seizure for 6 years. The disturbance of calcium metabolism seems to be chronic. Despite this chronicity, there were no neurological deficits, which may be due to less severe abnormality in the calcium levels and PTH.

Tonic-clonic seizures occurring with hypoparathyroidism have already been reported in literature. Fahr's disease can also attribute to the development of seizure, though the association is extremely rare. In our patient, seizure may be due to intracranial calcification or can be an independent entity. Similarly, the intracranial calcification may be due to Fahr's disease or due to hypoparathyroidism or can be a cumulative effect of both these entities. Evidence suggests that Fahr's disease can be associated with abnormalities in the metabolism of iron, calcium and porphyrinas well as abnormalities of parathyroid gland. The existing evidence suggests our diagnosis in this case (Fahr's disease with hypoparathyroidism).

### Basal ganglia lesions in children and adults [^74661d0a]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The term "basal ganglia" refers to caudate and lentiform nuclei, the latter composed of putamen and globus pallidus, substantia nigra and subthalamic nuclei and these deep gray matter structures belong to the extrapyramidal system. Many diseases may present as basal ganglia abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) - to a lesser degree - allow for detection of basal ganglia injury. In many cases, MRI alone does not usually allow to establish diagnosis but together with the knowledge of age and circumstances of onset and clinical course of the disease is a powerful tool of differential diagnosis. The lesions may be unilateral: in Rassmussen encephalitis, diabetes with hemichorea/hemiballism and infarction or - more frequently - bilateral in many pathologic conditions. Restricted diffusion is attributable to infarction, acute hypoxic-ischemic injury, hypoglycemia, Leigh disease, encephalitis and CJD. Contrast enhancement may be seen in cases of infarction and encephalitis. T1-hyperintensity of the lesions is uncommon and may be observed unilaterally in case of hemichorea/hemiballism and bilaterally in acute asphyxia in term newborns, in hypoglycemia, NF1, Fahr disease and manganese intoxication. Decreased signal intensity on GRE/T2✱-weighted images and/or SWI indicating iron, calcium or hemosiderin depositions is observed in panthotenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy, Fahr disease (and other calcifications) as well as with the advancing age. There are a few papers in the literature reviewing basal ganglia lesions. The authors present a more detailed review with rich iconography from the own archive.

### Genetic background of neurological disorders with basal ganglia calcification [^e9926728]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bilateral calcifications of the basal ganglia (BGCs), with or without calcifications in other brain regions, are the hallmark of rare monogenic diseases collectively called idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC; Fahr disease). Clinically, these disorders are characterized by neurological and psychiatric disease signs or symptoms, with a wide range of phenotypic expression and with reduced clinical penetrance. Pathogenic variants in 8 different genes are currently known to cause IBGC. Case series analyzed for IBGC genes have identified a monogenic cause in 19–47% of patients and families with BGCs.

While BGCs can also be caused by endocrine or infectious diseases, or associate with aging, BGCs of variable severity may occur in other neurogenetic disorders, and both genetic and mechanistic studies have highlighted an association of BGCs with MRI white matter hyperintensities and with cerebral small vessel disease and/or dysfunction of small vessels.

Here, we analyzed a series of 24 consecutive patients with BGCs and their relatives (genetic data from 38 and clinical data from 68 patients) from a tertiary neurology center for disease causes in known IBCG genes and in a large number of additional genes. These included genes associated with monogenic stroke or with white matter disease that had previously been associated with basal ganglia calcifications. Our aim was to determine the diagnostic yield of such comprehensive genetic analyses for determining the genetic cause of BGC patients and families. Furthermore, we described the clinical, radiological and genetic parameters in the various disorders with BGC in our series.

### Histology and computed tomography of incidental calcifications in the human basal ganglia [^72fdfa5d]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the histological nature of incidental basal ganglia calcifications and their association with CT findings. On histology, in an early stage, calcification was detected as granular to linear deposits in the internal elastic lamina, merging with more peripheral calcifications in or along the media in a later stage, ultimately forming a single (semi-) circular deposit. This is consistent with the type 1 calcifications described by Fujita in patients with neurodegenerative disease and also consistent with findings in patients with Fahr disease.

This study adds new information about calcifications in patients without Fahr disease, in group patients who underwent brain autopsy after their death.

CT scanning is the most common method to detect calcifications in the basal ganglia. However, comparison of CT and histological findings is problematic, because CT may not be sensitive enough to detect small calcifications. This is probably why CT scanning did not detect histologically proven calcifications in four patients. A limitation of histology is that sampling may miss areas with calcifications that are seen on CT, which may explain why two patients had calcifications seen on CT but not confirmed by histology. Nevertheless, in four patients, the basal ganglia calcifications seen on CT correlated with histological findings, namely, calcifications in small- and medium-sized vessels, probably following the vascular tree downstream. As the calcifications were located in the internal elastic lamina and the tunica media, we conclude that incidental CT calcifications are vascular in nature, but probably not atherosclerotic. The relevance of incidental basal ganglia calcifications needs to be investigated and correlated with motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms, such as those seen in Fahr disease.

### Friedreich's ataxia: treatment within reach [^11e1cde9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most prevalent cerebellar ataxia in children and adults in Europe. FA is one of a growing number of diseases known to be caused by triplet-repeat expansions. The causative mutation is a GAA trinucleotide-repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene. The mitochondrial localisation of frataxin and decreased oxidation activity in vivo and in vitro show that FA is a mitochondrial disease. Frataxin is involved in iron metabolism and may protect mitochondria from oxidative damage. The understanding of the disease has only just begun and possible treatments are within reach. In this review I discuss the clinical knowledge of FA and recent developments that have helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and made the first therapeutic attempts possible.

### A novel GNAS mutation in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a in a Chinese man presented with recurrent seizure: a case report [^0f57a639]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In this patient, the diagnosis of PHP was delayed due to the subtle symptoms of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. In this case, the prominent manifestation was seizure resulted from intracranial ectopic calcification, which was a misleading feature at the point of neurologists and could be misdiagnosed as Fahr syndrome. Fahr syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by bilateral basal ganglia calcification, which was common in PHP patients, but the symptoms of the former disease usually occur between the forth and sixth decade of life. Meanwhile, the average age of diagnosis of PHP was between 30 and 50 year-old in some cases, since the chronic electrolytes disturbance might not exert evident symptom. Most of the patient was first diagnosed for AHO alone or manifestations associated with ectopic ossification including basal ganglia in this case and subcutaneous calcification. Tetany and epilepsy was reported to be most common symptoms in PHP patients. The prevalence of epilepsy was 47.1, and 94.6% for intracranial calcification with a positive correlation with seizures in a Chinese cohort of PHP. This patient showed no sign of cognitive impairment or mental retardation as is common in PHP-1a patients. The severity of cognitive impairment varies and 30% of patients with PHP-1a display normal cognitive development, thus it is critical for clinicians to recognize AHO characteristics including infant obesity and brachydactyly at a small age to achieve early diagnosis.

### Update on genetic chorea [^44f3ce33]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Inherited Disorders With Metal or Mineral Deposition

This group includes rare genetic conditions characterized by abnormal accumulation of metals or minerals in the brain, often producing distinctive neuroimaging findings that can guide diagnosis. Chorea may be present, although often as part of a broader movement disorder spectrum.

7.1 Primary Familial Brain Calcification

PFBC, formerly known as Fahr disease, is defined by bilateral calcium deposition in the basal ganglia and cerebellum best visualized on CT scan. It is most frequently caused by AD mutations in the SLC20A2 gene, with variable penetrance and expressivity. Other AD genes include PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XRP1. Clinically, the syndrome is primarily characterized by parkinsonism and ataxia, although choreoathetosis may also be present in up to 12%–16% of genetically confirmed cases. Additionally, neuropsychiatric alterations and cognitive decline are observed. Genetic diagnosis relies on NGS or WES panels including both AD and AR PFBC genes, with CNV analysis, after excluding metabolic mimics such as hypoparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency.

7.2 Wilson's Disease

Wilson's disease (AR, ATP7B) is a treatable disorder of copper metabolism. Neurological presentations include parkinsonism, dystonia (often with risus sardonicus), tremor ("wing‐beating" tremor), psychiatric symptoms with chorea in only 5%–10% of cases The Kayser‐ Fleischer ring is a hallmark finding in patients with neurological symptoms. Diagnosis begins with low serum ceruloplasmin and elevated 24‐h urinary copper excretion. Genetic confirmation requires full sequencing of ATP7B with MLPA if needed. Brain MRI may show the classic "face‐of‐the‐panda" midbrain sign.

### Unanswered questions in friedreich ataxia [^4a53bb6f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

During the past 15 years, the pace of research advancement in Friedreich ataxia has been rapid. The abnormal gene has been discovered and its gene product characterized, leading to the development of new evidence-based therapies. Still, various unsettled issues remain that affect clinical trials. These include the level of frataxin deficiency needed to cause disease, the mechanism by which frataxin-deficient mitochondrial dysfunction leads to symptomatology, and the reason selected cells are most affected in Friedreich ataxia. In this review, we summarize these questions and propose testable hypotheses for their resolution.

### Idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications: an atypical presentation of PKAN [^753c8d7e]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We report a patient with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration presenting as idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications, previously known as Fahr's disease.

Methods

A teenage girl presented with slowly progressive dystonia. Her brain magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed T1 and T2 hypointensities in both globus pallidi, and no eye-of-the-tiger sign. Computed tomography showed dense globus pallidi calcifications. Metabolic evaluation was negative. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications, a poorly understood syndrome of unknown cause. Whole exome sequencing was performed.

Results

The patient was found to have two mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene that have been previously associated with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration: a paternally inherited p.G521R and maternally inherited p.T528M. No deleterious changes were identified in genes associated with idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications or dystonia.

Conclusions

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration should be considered in patients with idiopathic basal ganglia calcifications, especially when findings are confined to the globus pallidus.

Metabolic disease

Wernicke's encephalopathy

Wernicke's encephalopathy, or alcoholic encephalopathy, results from dietary deficiency of vitamin B 1. The classic triad of symptoms includes altered consciousness/confusion, ocular dysfunction, and gait disturbances/ataxia. Approximately 50% of Wernicke's encephalopathy cases are not alcohol related and are caused by malnutrition and intractable vomiting, among others. MRI shows T2WI and FLAIR hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and gadolinium enhancement adjacent to the third ventricle (Fig. 5), the tectal plate and the periaqueductal area, hypothalamus, medial thalami, mammillary bodies, and the nucleus of cranial nerve XII. These regions are at increased risk in alcoholic patients possibly due to malfunction of the blood-brain barrier.

Fig. 5
Axial FSE T2 (a) and coronal FLAIR (b) illustrate hyperintensity surrounding the third ventricle (arrows). These abnormalities are associated with diffusion restriction (arrows in c and d)

Fahr's disease

Fahr's disease is a degenerative condition involving the basal ganglia bilaterally and symmetrically, including the thalamus, dentate nuclei, and deep or subcortical white matter (Fig. 6). It shows, in most cases, autosomal recessive or dominant transmission. Clinical manifestations include pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The main differential diagnosis includes Aicardi-Goutières encephalopathy, Cockayne syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, and complications of intrathecal chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

CT shows calcification of the basal ganglia, thalami, and subcortical white matter. MRI shows variable signal intensity on T1WI and T2WI in the same locations.

Wilson's disease

This autosomal recessive condition leads to deposits of copper in the liver and brain. Clinical symptoms include dysarthria, dystonia, and tremor. On MRI, copper deposits in the lentiform nucleus and thalamus are hypointense on T2WI and gradient echo (GRE). High signal intensity in the outer rim of the putamen is often seen on T2WI and FLAIR (Fig. 7).

### Brain stones revisited-between a rock and a hard place [^41e18b97]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Endocrine/metabolic

Intracranial calcifications and brain stones due to endocrine and metabolic causes are generally the result of abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and characteristically symmetrically affect the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum. Fahr's syndrome is an exception in that there are usually no accompanying abnormalities involving serum calcium levels or hormone levels. The basal ganglia, white matter and cerebellar calcifications in Fahr's syndrome may be minimal or massive, and have been demonstrated in pathological studies to be calcium deposits in capillary walls, small arterioles and veins including perivascular spaces, with studies showing a correlation between the amount of calcification and symptom severity (Fig. 9). On the other hand, diabetes mellitus has also been shown to result in bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and gray-white matter interfaces presumably due to hypernatremia-induced endothelial cell damage with a relative lack of neurological symptoms. Hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism affect calcium homeostasis because of parathyroid gland dysfunction and abnormal parathyroid hormone levels, resulting in calcifications in the basal ganglia, dentate nucleus and subcortical areas with clinical symptoms ranging from seizures to tremors and parkinsonism. Calcium chelation using bisphosphonates is currently being investigated as possible treatment for symmetric calcification-related neurological symptoms with promising initial results.

Fig. 9
A 35-year-old female with a history of multiple shunt revisions was found to have symmetric calcifications in the cerebellum and basal ganglia on CT (a, b) and 3D reconstruction (c). Although not confirmed in this patient, the presence of symmetric calcifications in these regions in young patients is generally thought to be related to a possible diagnosis of Fahr syndrome or an endocrine disorder

Autopsy brains of FTD and Alzheimer's disease patients were dissected, and specific regions were paraffin embedded. Histochemical and advanced immunohistochemical analyses were performed as previously described. Consensus criteria were used to establish the neuropathological diagnosis.

In the FTD cohort, 45 patients had a brain autopsy and 43 patients had confirmed underlying FTLD pathology, i.e. 29 with trans-active response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (FTLD-TDP), seven patients with tau (FTLD-tau), three with proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome system (FTLD-UPS), two with associated proteins of FUS (fused in sarcoma), Ewing's sarcoma and TATA-binding protein associated factor 2N family (FTLD-FET), one with globular glial tauopathy (FTLD-GGT), one patient with Alzheimer's disease with FTLD-TDP, one with Alzheimer's disease only and one with vascular lesions only.

In the Alzheimer's disease cohort, brain autopsy and anatomopathological investigation confirmed definite Alzheimer's disease in 98 patients, of whom seven had combined pathology of Alzheimer's disease with Lewy body disease (n = 1), with Lewy body disease and Fahr's disease (n = 1), with vascular dementia (n = 4) and with Lewy body disease and vascular dementia (n = 1).

### Clinical and scientific perspectives on movement disorders: stanley fahn's contributions [^ad7faa87]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Dr. Stanley Fahn, the H. Houston Merritt Professor of Neurology and Director Emeritus of the Center for Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders at Columbia University, one of the founders of the field of movement disorders, was the first president of the Movement Disorders Society (subsequently renamed as the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society). Together with his friend and colleague, Professor David Marsden, he also served as the first co-editor of the journal Movement Disorders. By emphasizing phenomenology as the key element in differentiating various hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement disorders, Dr. Fahn drew attention to the clinical history and the power of observation in the diagnosis of movement disorders. Dr. Fahn had major influence on the development of classifications and assessments of various movement disorders and in organizing various research groups such as the Parkinson Study Group. As the founder and president of the World Parkinson Coalition and an organizer of the initial three World Parkinson Congresses, he has demonstrated his long-standing commitment to the cause of including patients as partners. The primary goal and objective of this invited review is to highlight some of Dr. Fahn's most impactful scientific and clinical contributions to the understanding and treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and other movement disorders.

### Inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in CSF is a biomarker for SLC20A2-associated idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC1) [^7af523d6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), also called Fahr's disease or recently primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), is characterized by abnormal deposits of minerals including calcium mainly and phosphate in the brain. Mutations in SLC20A2 (IBGC1 (merged with former IBGC2 and IBGC3)), which encodes PiT-2, a phosphate transporter, is the major cause of IBGC. Recently, Slc20a2-KO mice have been showed to have elevated levels of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF Pi levels in patients with IBGC have not been fully examined.

Methods

We investigated the cases of 29 patients with IBGC including six patients with SLC20A2 mutation and three patients with PDGFB mutation, and 13 controls. The levels of sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), and Pi in sera and CSF were determined by potentiometry and colorimetry. Moreover, clinical manifestations were investigated in the IBGC patients with high Pi levels in CSF.

Results

The study revealed that the average level of Pi in the CSF of the total group of patients with IBGC is significantly higher than that of the control group, and the levels of Pi in CSF of the IBGC patients with SLC20A2 mutations are significantly higher than those of the IBGC patients with PDGFB mutations, the other IBGC patients and controls.

Conclusion

Results of this study suggest that the levels of CSF Pi will be a good biomarker for IBGC1.

### A patient with extensive cerebral calcification due to pseudohypoparathyroidism: a case report [^65ed9591]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Differential diagnoses in this patient who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia were hypoparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism due to long standing vitamin D deficiency, PTH resistance due to magnesium deficiency and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Elevated serum intact PTH level narrowed down the differentials to the latter three diagnoses. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was considered unlikely in the absence of conditions leading to longstanding vitamin D deficiency such as chronic kidney disease, gastric or intestinal surgery and chronic diarrhoea suggestive of Chron's disease or celiac disease. Severe hypocalcaemia and high PTH level couldn't be explained solely by marginally low (insufficient) Vitamin D level. Although severe hypomagnesemia is well known to cause hypocalcaemia through a combination of defective PTH secretion and some degree of PTH resistance mild hypomagnesemia is unlikely to cause isolated PTH resistance leading to such severe hypocalcaemia. Also cerebral calcification can't be explained by hypomagnesemia alone. The presence of severe hypocalcaemia and elevated PTH with a marginally low vitamin D level and especially the basal, thalamic and dentate ganglia calcification suggests the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Although PHP presenting at 59 years of age is uncommon there have been previous reports of adults presenting with symptomatic hypocalcaemia due to PHP.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase is thought to be due to development of osteomalacia secondary to reduced conversion of 25- hydroxyvitamin D to its active form i.e. 1, 25- dihydroxyvitamin D in the absence of PTH action and concurrent vitamin D deficiency.

The radiological findings of basal ganglia calcification seen in this case are well described in PHP. However cortical calcification is a rare finding and this is the first such report from Sri Lanka. Other differential diagnoses for this presentation are familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr's disease), neoplastic, vascular, infectious, and congenital causes, as well as other endocrine/metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. However hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and increased PTH seen in this patient favor the diagnosis of PHP.

### Novel mutations in FA2H-associated neurodegeneration: an underrecognized condition? [^0258eab1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary spastic paraplegias and related genetically heterogeneous disorders may be difficult to distinguish clinically. The FA2H gene has been associated with autosomal recessive neurodegenerative phenotypes encompassing spastic paraplegia with or without dystonia, and demyelinating leukodystrophy. To date, few individuals with mutations in the FA2H gene have been described. We report a 5-year-old girl of mixed Filipino and Vietnamese origin who presented with progressive lower limb spasticity and periventricular leukomalacia. The clinical diagnosis of FA2H-associated neurodegeneration was confirmed on the basis of 2 novel mutations in compound heterozygosity in the FA2H gene (p.S70L/p.P323L). This family highlights that FA2H-associated disorders may be underrecognized in children with neurodegeneration of many different ethnicities. Magnetic resonance imaging features play an important role as diagnostic clues in this and other hereditary spastic paraplegias. The consideration of this diagnosis is essential in providing families with important information on prognosis, as well as accurate genetic counseling.

### Movement disorders in Friedreich's ataxia [^0e285c13]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2003). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the gene mutation causing Friedreich's ataxia (FA), the rich spectrum of clinical manifestations of this autosomal recessive disorder is being increasingly recognized. Movement disorders besides ataxia, however, have not been fully characterized in patients with FA. We describe here two young male patients who, in addition to progressive ataxia, kinetic tremor and other typical features of FA, also manifest axial and limb dystonia. The primary purpose of this report is to draw attention to the broad spectrum of hyperkinetic movement disorders that can present as or be associated with FA.

### Neuroimaging biomarkers for friedreich ataxia: a cross-sectional analysis of the TRACK-FA study [^40d7ba32]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. A homozygous expansion of an intronic GAA trinucleotide repeat is present in the majority of those affected. Average age of onset is between 8 and 14 years, and the hallmark neurological features include gait and limb ataxia, and dysarthria. Natural history studies demonstrate highly differential progression across subpopulations stratified by age, genetic severity, disease stage, and duration.

Interventional trials for Friedreich ataxia often use clinical scales as outcome measures; however, these have limited sensitivity, necessitating longer trial durations and increased participants to obtain adequate statistical power. Additionally, clinical scales have shown limitations in certain populations, such as young pediatric or late‐stage disesase, resulting in the requirement to extrapolate effects. The recent approval of omaveloxolone, the first treatment for individuals with Friedreich ataxia (age 16 years and older), underscores the need for sensitive and clinically meaningful outcome measures.

Neuroimaging biomarkers offer a promising avenue to overcome limitations associated with clinical scales. Small‐scale neuroimaging studies in Friedreich ataxia have shown atrophy and microstructural changes in the cerebellum, cerebellar pathways, and spinal cord. However, modest sample sizes in single‐site studies preclude stratification by age or disease severity. Few studies include children and none under 10 years old. Collaborative efforts have addressed some limitations, by meta‐analyzing existing neuroimaging datasets, confirming that Friedreich ataxia is associated with regionally specific patterns of atrophy, the magnitude of which correlate with disease severity. However, large‐scale neuroimaging studies are urgently needed to validate sensitive biomarkers of disease progression.

TRACK‐FAis the largest prospective, longitudinal, multi‐site, multi‐modal neuroimaging study in Friedreich ataxia to date. Designed with principles similar to a clinical trial, TRACK‐FA uses a harmonized protocol and rigorous quality control. It is the first multi‐modal neuroimaging study to include individuals with Friedreich ataxia and matched controls spanning young children to adults. The cohort will be assessed at 3 timepoints (baseline, 12, and 24 months). The primary objective is to create a robust longitudinal dataset that will identify the most sensitive neuroimaging biomarker/s of disease progression, laying the groundwork for their integration into future clinical trials.

### Proposal for a new set of classification criteria for adult-onset still disease [^d6da99d2]. Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Fautrel's diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease" for adult-onset Still's disease.

Fautrel's diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this rare systemic inflammatory disorder. The criteria are particularly useful in distinguishing adult-onset Still's disease from other conditions with similar presentations, such as infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases.

The criteria consist of both major and minor components. The major components include spiking fever of 39 degrees Celsius or higher, arthralgia, transient erythema, pharyngitis, polymorphonuclear cells constituting 80% or more of the total white blood cell count, and glycosylated ferritin levels of 20% or less. Each of these major components contributes significantly to the overall score.

Minor components of the criteria include a maculopapular rash and leukocytosis of 10,000/mm³ or more. These minor components, while less significant than the major components, still contribute to the overall diagnostic score.

The diagnostic criteria are considered met if the total score is 8 or higher. If the total score is less than 8, the diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease are not considered met. This scoring system allows for a standardized approach to diagnosing adult-onset Still's disease, facilitating early and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

The diagnostic tool for adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) employs Fautrel's criteria, evaluating a range of symptoms and lab results to calculate a cumulative score. Users provide details on the presence of specific clinical features, and each feature contributes a set number of points to the overall score. Here's how the scoring works:

- **Spiking fever of 39 degrees C or higher**: 2 points
- **Arthralgia (joint pain)**: 2 points
- **Transient erythema (temporary skin redness)**: 2 points
- **Pharyngitis (sore throat)**: 2 points
- **Polymorphonuclear cells at 80% or more**: 2 points
- **Glycosylated ferritin of 20% or below**: 2 points
- **Maculopapular rash**: 1 point
- **Leukocytosis (white blood cell count) of 10,000/mm³ or higher**: 1 point

The process involves checking whether each symptom or laboratory parameter is present. If a symptom is present, the allocated points for that feature are added to the total score. If absent, no points are added. This accumulates to a score that can range from 0 to 14.

Interpretation of the total score is key:

- A score of 8 or higher indicates that the diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease are met, suggesting a high likelihood of the disease.
- A score below 8 means the diagnostic criteria are not met, suggesting a lower likelihood of AOSD.

The cumulative score and its interpretation provide a guideline for diagnosis, helping clinicians assess the probability of AOSD based on the presence and combination of these clinical indicators.

### An open-label pilot study of recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in Friedreich's ataxia [^b043c59f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacological interventions to increase frataxin expression and reverse the deleterious effects of frataxin deficiency are attractive therapeutic approaches in FA. We have shown that a course of G-CSF therapy in participants with FA is safe, is associated with effective HSC mobilisation, and leads to significant elevations in frataxin together with improvements in biochemical deficits associated with FA. Nevertheless, the need for future assessment of G-CSF administration on affected tissues, such as the heart and brain, using a range of dose levels and dosing frequencies is required. The long-term safety of sustained G-CSF administration in people with FA is also unknown. The natural rate of disease progression in FA necessitates prolonged trial periods to sufficiently detect changes in clinical measures. This study provides proof-of-principle evidence to support an efficacy study of G-CSF administration in FA, using repeated courses over a longer period.

### Brain stones revisited-between a rock and a hard place [^70b10c9b]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Extra-axial

The most common extra-axial aetiologies of brain stones include meningiomas, dural osteomas, calcifying tumours (e.g. craniopharyngiomas) as well as exaggerated physiological calcifications. Macroscopic calcifications are present in meningiomas in up to 60% of cases, the pattern of which may range from diffuse, rim or sand-like to focal or even globular (Fig. 1). Calcified meningiomas can be associated with focal thickening of the overlying skull bones or with dilatation of the adjacent air-containing sinus of the skull base. Dural osteomas are believed to be a result of new bone formation arising from the dura and falx; conversely, intra-axial intracerebral osteomas are postulated to originate from primitive mesenchymal cells that have migrated from connective tissue (Fig. 2). Unique to these rare ossified tumours is the fact that they do not possess a laminated bony architecture, but present as a solid mass of calcification. Craniopharyngiomas are frequently located in the suprasellar region and usually present with haemorrhage and calcification mainly in an amorphous and sometimes lobulated pattern. Calcifying pseudoneoplasms of the neuraxis (CAPNON) are extremely rare fibro-osseous lesions that can be extra- or intra-axial. Histologically, these benign lesions are composed of a pathognomonic chondromyxoid matrix in an amorphous or nodular pattern as well as palisading spindle or epithelioid cells and varying proportions of fibrous stroma. When present in the skull base, they are known to symptomatically encase cranial nerves. Lastly, exaggerated physiological calcifications can theoretically lead to identification of brain stones in radiological examinations. Structures known to calcify include the pineal gland, choroid plexus, habenula, dura and arachnoid, falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, superior sagittal sinus, petroclinoid and interclinoid ligaments, arachnoid granulations and intra-axially the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Although physiological calcifications are usually considered of no clinical significance, the presence of pathology may be suspected in cases of abnormal increase in their usual size [e.g. normal choroid plexus calcification versus a choroid papilloma (Fig. 3) or carcinoma], location (e.g. displaced pineal gland due to tumour) or age at presentation [e.g. age-related basal ganglia calcification versus Fahr's disease in younger individuals (Fig. 9)].

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^d087d6c0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

An international Delphi panel of expert clinicians, athletes, patients and their representatives, and researchers — representing the YAHiR Collaborative — agreed on set of research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip focusing on primary cam morphology and its natural history, reported here following REPRISE guidelines. They outlined seven research domains: (1) best practice physiotherapy, (2) rehabilitation progression and RTS, (3) exercise intervention and load management, (4) primary cam morphology aetiology and prognosis, (5) FAI syndrome aetiology and prognosis, (6) diagnostic criteria, and (7) screening. This consensus serves as a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to prioritise research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of conditions affecting the young person's hip, including hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

In what follows, we discuss the Delphi panel's opinions on a prioritised research agenda and summarise how agreement and areas of tension and dissent might inform future work — a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history. This consensus builds on recent consensus statementsand a primary cam morphology concept analysisand consensus (Oxford consensus study, part 1).

Best practice physiotherapy is central to the treatment of hip-related pain in active adults, crucial to the understanding of effective treatment options for FAI syndrome, yet elusive and contested. The panel recommended research to (1) clarify what best practice physiotherapy is, (2) illuminate how it influences FAI syndrome prognosis and (3) reinvestigate its position as an effective treatment option compared with hip arthroscopy in patients with hip-related pain. First, practitioners and patients are confused by an elusive definition for best practice physiotherapy. A recent consensus on physiotherapist-led treatment for young to middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain recommended treatments that are exercise-based of at least 3 months duration and recommended further research to investigate optimal frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progression of exercise therapy. Second, heterogeneous physiotherapist-led interventions might improve pain and function when compared with other non-surgical treatments or sham treatments in young and middle-aged adults with hip-related pain (including FAI syndrome); however, no high-quality trials exist to cement its superiority. Finally, the only three RCTs comparing hip arthroscopy with prescribed physiotherapywere compromised by out-of-date exercise therapy programmes. New trials should do better.

Results

Clinical characteristics of the included participants

This study included 367 participants (sex, 203 women and 164 men; age, 69.0 ± 9.2 [range, 39–88] years). The clinical diagnoses of the participants included idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 287), multiple system atrophy (n = 17), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 14), isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (n = 9), drug-induced Parkinsonism (n = 3), essential tremor (n = 14), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (n = 12), cerebellar ataxia (n = 4; including two cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6), Fahr's syndrome (n = 1), normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 4), and healthy participants (n = 2).

Relationship between SMWI and 123 I-FP-CIT-SPECT findings

Of the 367 participants, 293 showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI and 308 showed abnormal visual results on 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT, with a concordance rate of 95.4% (Table 1). Among them, one participant diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but normal finding on 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT, presumably due to the mild decrease in striatal DaT uptake which resulted in a visually normal appearance. In addition, 16 participants showed intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but abnormal finding on 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 12), multiple system atrophy (n = 1), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (n = 2), and Fahr's syndrome (n = 1). The measured 123 I-FP-CIT SBR of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was significantly lower than that of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity (2.36 ± 0.86 vs. 4.31 ± 1.11, P < 0.01).

### Friedreich's ataxia-associated childhood hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a national cohort study [^a4cb7dec]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study describes the clinical presentation, phenotype and outcomes of a large national cohort of patients with FA-HCM. Novel findings include a high prevalence of atrial arrhythmias and impaired systolic function in childhood, suggesting early progression to end-stage disease. Overall mortality was comparable with non-syndromic childhood HCM, but no sudden deaths occurred.

Clinical presentation

Retrospective population-based studies have described FA-HCM to present in late childhood or early adulthood, in contrast to other syndromic causes of HCM, such as the RASopathies. The largest childhood series to date described the longitudinal course of 28 patients, not all of whom developed HCM during follow-up. The present manuscript describes a unique national cohort of patients with childhood FA-HCM and represents the largest reported study of this disease. In keeping with previous reports, the mean age of presentation was over the age of 10 and no patients presented in infancy. Nevertheless, two-fifths of patients presented in preadolescence (< 10 years of age) and three (4%) presented under the age of 5 years. In addition, a small proportion of patients were diagnosed with HCM prior to the diagnosis of FA. These findings highlight the importance of including FA in the differential diagnosis for all childhood HCM, regardless of the age of presentation and presence of neurological features. Two-thirds were asymptomatic when first seen, which supports the practice of routine serial cardiac screening for all patients with FA.

### Fabry disease model: a rational approach to the management of Fabry disease [^ab6d16f6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Fabry disease (FD) is a truly progressive, multisystemic disorder. Clinically, the disease will present with 2 different faces throughout the lifetime of a patient: peripheral neurologic involvement predominates the symptoms in the first 3 decades of life (early symptoms), whereas major clinical events in the kidneys and heart or cerebrovascular system (late complications) largely determine the morbidity and mortality after 30 years of age. Before clinical manifestations occur in any organ system, there appears to be an insidious, subclinical progression of disease activities in various organ systems. Different stages of disease progression are associated with varying prognoses and potential responses to therapy, which provide a strong rationale for early intervention. Different stages may also be associated with various secondary pathologic events, which can provide indications for the use of a combination of interventions meant to control the primary pathology (lysosomal storage) as well as modifiable pathologies or correctable failures. A rational approach to FD and the therapy options available may help determine treatment choices and define therapeutic objectives as a function of optimal health outcomes, adequately reflecting the actual stage of disease progression, in individual patients.

Finally, it is logical to assume that the disease phenotype becomes apparent when enough tissue and cellular function has been lost to overwhelm the physiologic redundancy that all vertebrate animals have in major organ systems. Any meaningful "staging" or predictive tools for outcome must include the young. Otherwise, cross-sectional studies are biased and not useful (see Peverill letter). Earlier diagnosis is certain to generate a better understanding of the natural history of the heart in this disease, as well as identifying fundamental mechanisms of Fe-S cluster assembly and regulation.

### Guidelines for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): challenges in defining clinical management for a rare disease [^e01456bf]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent updated management guidelines for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) have been published by professional bodies internationally. These recommendations reflect the diverse needs and capabilities of varying health systems worldwide, including thresholds for intervention and population health priorities. Whilst guidelines are closely aligned in many regards, there are areas of disparity. However, alongside discrepancies in guideline recommendations, common challenges also face professional bodies across the globe. Generation of a robust evidence-base in the environment of limited data is difficult in rare diseases such as FAP, underscored by the fact that expert consensus opinion underpins virtually all guidelines. The presence of a wide phenotypic spectrum in FAP and the other hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, whilst now well recognised, further complicates the creation of universal recommendations. In this review we draw comparison between the various international guidelines for the management of FAP, using examples to focus on thematic areas of agreement and divergence. However, beyond this, we also wish to highlight the persisting evidence gaps in clinical management, and any areas of ongoing debate among clinicians, where we are yet to establish the optimal approach.

### Current approaches to the management of hemochromatosis [^4b1d5e1c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

The term hemochromatosis encompasses at least four types of genetic iron overload conditions, most of them recently distinguished from one another as a result of the identification of a series of genes related to iron metabolism. At least three of these entities (HFE hemochromatosis, juvenile hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor 2 hemochromatosis) involve systemic hepcidin deficiency as a key pathogenetic factor. Major advances in the management of hemochromatosis influence the diagnostic approach to the disease, with the development of an overall non invasive strategy, mainly based on clinical, biological (iron parameters and genetic testing), and imaging (especially magnetic resonance imaging) data. Therapeutic management remains, on the curative side, dominated by phlebotomy (venesection), practical aspects of which have been recently revisited by the Guidelines Department of the French "Haute Autorité de Santé". However, innovative treatment approaches, based on the improved pathophysiological understanding of these diseases and the progress in iron chelation therapy, are emerging. Preventive therapy, focused on family screening, remains a key part of the management of hemochromatosis.

### The heart in friedreich ataxia: definition of cardiomyopathy, disease severity, and correlation with neurological symptoms [^aaa3a72f]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This cross-sectional study provides a practical approach for the clinical assessment of Friedreich ataxia (FA) cardiomyopathy (FA-CM).

Methods and Results

A comprehensive cardiac assessment, including standard echocardiography, color Doppler myocardial imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, ECG, and exercise stress testing, was performed in 205 FA patients. To assess myocardial hypertrophy in FA-CM, the end-diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness (IVSTd) was found to be the best echocardiographic parameter compared with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-determined left ventricular mass. With the use of this parameter, 4 groups of patients with FA-CM could be defined. Patients with normal values for IVSTd (31.7%) were classified as having no FA-CM. Patients with an IVSTd exceeding the predicted normal IVSTd were classified as having mild FA-CM (40%) if IVSTd exceeded the normal value by < 18% or as having intermediate FA-CM (16.1%) if IVSTd exceeded the normal value by ≥ 18%. Patients with ejection fraction < 50% were classified as having severe FA-CM (12.2%). In addition to increased myocardial mass, severe FA-CM was further characterized by dilatation of the left ventricle, reduced systolic strain rate of the posterior wall, and ECG abnormalities. Regional myocardial function correlated negatively with FA-CM groups. Younger patients had a tendency for more advanced FA-CM. Importantly, no clear correlation was found between FA-CM groups and neurological function.

Conclusions

We provide and describe a readily applicable clinical grouping of the cardiomyopathy associated with FA based on echocardiographic IVSTd and ejection fraction data. Because no distinct interrelations between FA-CM and neurological status could be determined, regular follow-up of potential cardiac involvement in FA patients is essential in clinical practice.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

### European expert consensus statement on therapeutic goals in Fabry disease [^1bd474bc]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fabry disease, an inherited lysosomal storage disorder, causes multi-organ pathology resulting in substantial morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Although Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, both genders may be affected, but generally to a lesser extent in females. The disease spectrum ranges from classic early-onset disease to non-classic later-onset phenotypes, with complications occurring in multiple organs or being confined to a single organ system depending on the stage of the disease. The impact of therapy depends upon patient- and disease-specific factors and timing of initiation.

Methods

A European panel of experts collaborated to develop a set of organ-specific therapeutic goals for Fabry disease, based on evidence identified in a recent systematic literature review and consensus opinion.

Results

A series of organ-specific treatment goals were developed. For each organ system, optimal treatment strategies accounted for inter-patient differences in disease severity, natural history, and treatment responses as well as the negative burden of therapy and the importance of multidisciplinary care. The consensus therapeutic goals and proposed patient management algorithm take into account the need for early disease-specific therapy to delay or slow the progression of disease as well as non-specific adjunctive therapies that prevent or treat the effects of organ damage on quality of life and long-term prognosis.

Conclusions

These consensus recommendations help advance Fabry disease management by considering the balance between anticipated clinical benefits and potential therapy-related challenges in order to facilitate individualized treatment, optimize patient care and improve quality of life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^a762e6c2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Ongoing and Future Research

There are still significant gaps in our understanding of optimal diagnostic tools and management methods for individuals with FH. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation established the ongoing CASCADE‐FH registry to address gaps in knowledge and identify barriers to comprehensive FH screening, identification, and treatment among 40 clinical sites across the United States. Patients with FH are being followed longitudinally to track changes in LDL‐C‐lowering therapy, LDL‐C goal achievement, patient‐reported outcomes, and clinical outcomes. 103 Data as of February 2017 demonstrated that < 50% of patients were aware of available treatment options and the increased risk of heart disease. 104 Results from the CASCADE‐FH registry, and similar registries in Europe and Asia, will help inform optimal screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies in FH.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^fbd8dbf3]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) response modifiers — age at onset and timing of therapy: A poor response to L-dopa was described in just 10 patients with symptom onset before age 6 months and a tendency toward later treatment initiation (median age 4.0 years, range 1.9–19 years), compared to patients with symptom onset before age 6 months who had a good response (n = 58) with treatment initiated at median age 1.7 years (range 0.4–13 years); this suggests that early initiation of treatment is beneficial, while symptom onset age and primary disease severity also play roles.

### How is disease progress in Friedreich's ataxia best measured? A study of four rating scales [^e4140150]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common genetic cause of ataxia, is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. Initial treatments are likely to slow progression rather than reverse morbidity. An appropriate and sensitive scale to measure disease progress is critical to detect the benefit of treatments.

Objective

To compare the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) with other scales proposed as outcome measures for FRDA.

Methods

76 participants were assessed with the FARS and the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and 72 of these participants were also assessed with the Functional Independence Measure and the Modified Barthel Index. 43 participants had repeat measures at an interval of 12 months. Sensitivity and responsiveness were assessed using the effect size for each measure and the sample size required for a placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Results

The FARS showed a high correlation with the other three measures. A significant change in the score over 12 months was detected by the FARS, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale and the Functional Independence Measure. The FARS had the greatest effect size and requires fewer patients for an equivalently powered study.

Conclusions

Of the scales assessed, the FARS is the best to use in clinical trials of FRDA. This is based on effect size, and power calculations that show that fewer participants are required to demonstrate the same effect of an intervention. Further work is required to develop more sensitive and responsive instruments.

### Neuroimaging biomarkers for friedreich ataxia: a cross-sectional analysis of the TRACK-FA study [^1e017316]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several limitations should be noted. First, although these analyses reveal associations across various age groups and disease severities, they offer a cross‐sectional snapshot. Because TRACK‐FA is longitudinal in nature, subsequent follow‐up analyses will enable quantification of the rate of change in POMs within and between groups, potentially identifying the most sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Second, although TRACK‐FA is unique in its assessment of neuroimaging outcomes in children, the number of very young participants is relatively small. This may have limited our ability to detect associations between POMs and clinical parameters. Third, generalizability of our findings is limited to the population of individuals who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The cohort is skewed to earlier disease stages. Almost 75% were in mild to moderate FSS categories, therefore, indicating that most of the cohort was ambulatory. This contrasts with the broader Friedreich ataxia population, in which individuals become wheelchair‐dependent on average 10 to 15 years after symptom onset.

TRACK‐FA aims to unravel the natural progression of the disease in the central nervous system. By assessing participants across ages and disease stages, including young children, we conclude that MR scans of brain and spinal cord can detect significant abnormalities even in the earliest disease stages, driven by abnormal development, especially in the spinal cord. Moreover, our results suggest that structures higher up in the spino‐cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway, such as the cerebrum, tend to change later in the disease course. Ultimately, based on this work, in conjunction with forthcoming 12‐ and 24‐month longitudinal follow‐up, TRACK‐FA will contribute to the identification of the most sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers of progression, according to age and disease stage. This will lay the critical groundwork required for advancing these biomarkers into future clinical trials.

### Safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in friedreich ataxia (MOXIe study) [^2397bc60]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, omaveloxolone treatment significantly improved neurological function relative to placebo after 48 weeks of treatment. Unlike patients treated with placebo, whose mFARS scores worsened, patients treated with omaveloxolone had improvements in neurological function after 48 weeks. This occurred not only in the primary analysis but also in post hoc analyses accounting for additional baseline covariates that were meaningfully different across randomized cohorts. Moreover, the magnitude of observed improvements is equivalent to approximately 2 years of FA disease progression, as judged by similar cohorts based on age in a natural history (FACOMS) study. 19 Although a small placebo response was noted during the first 12 weeks of the study, the two treatment groups steadily diverged thereafter, and the rate of disease progression between weeks 12 and 48 for patients randomized to placebo was similar to natural history data. 19 More importantly, the improvements in upright stability with omaveloxolone relative to placebo demonstrate an effect on the mFARS component that defines important clinical milestones in FA, including loss of ambulation. 20

### Evaluation of clinical diagnostic criteria for psychogenic movement disorders [^cd972ba6]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Previous studies showed that there are certain features suggestive of a psychogenic disorder, and Fahn and Williams proposed criteria for psychogenic movement disorders. Data on the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria are lacking. We expanded on the Fahn and Williams criteria to create a new set of diagnostic criteria. We retrospectively reviewed 79 patients in a movement disorders specialty clinic. We applied the proposed diagnostic criteria to both cases and controls and analyzed sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic criteria correctly identified "clinically probable" (or better) psychogenic movement disorders with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 100%. For "clinically possible" or greater, sensitivity was 97% and specificity was 96%. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of patients with psychogenic disease were female and reported either a family history of neurological disease or other exposure to neurological disease (P = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). The diagnostic criteria are simple to apply and have high sensitivity and specificity for psychogenic movement disorders. Also, we report a correlation between previous exposure to a disease model and psychogenic disease.

### Multiple mechanisms underpin cerebral and cerebellar white matter deficits in friedreich ataxia: the IMAGE-FRDA study [^7a67582c]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

These questions can be addressed using comprehensive multi‐modal neuroimaging of white matter in individuals with FRDA, including direct comparisons between the different available white matter indices. Although not direct measures of any specific property of individual axons, these measures have been associated with different types of white matter damage. While FA is considered sensitive but non‐specific to multiple underlying neuropathological processes (Alexander et al. 2011), RD and the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) may be influenced by axon myelination (Janve et al. 2013; Rausch et al. 2009), and changes in AD and volume loss have been associated with axonal damage (Sun et al. 2006) and degeneration (Salat, Kaye, & Janowsky, 1999), respectively. Comparison of deficits across multiple white matter indices may provide valuable information, albeit indirect (Jones, Knösche, & Turner, 2013), about the processes underpinning white matter changes in FRDA, which may be valuable for hypothesis‐generation in future studies. Importantly, similar multi‐modal approaches have provided new disease insights in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (Poudel et al. 2015) and Alzheimer's disease (Canu et al. 2010; Huang, Friedland, & Auchus, 2007).

In the present study, we undertook a multi‐modal assessment of the characteristics of whole‐brain white matter in FRDA, as part of the IMAGE‐FRDA study. We aimed to replicate previous white matter studies in a large single‐site cohort of individuals with FRDA, by firstly characterizing the pattern of white matter abnormalities and secondly investigating their relationship with clinical variables. Furthermore, we aimed to extend the existing body of work by examining the relationships between white matter indices to determine whether different measures of white matter reflect common or unique disease‐related processes in individuals with FRDA. Characterizing the pattern of observed alterations across multiple measures provides opportunities for novel insights into the potential mechanisms that drive white matter abnormalities across the brain (e.g. demyelination, axonal loss, volumetric loss).

### How is variability in femoral and acetabular version associated with presentation among young adults with hip pain? [^05f8c0bd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetabular and femoral version contribute to hip pain in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or dysplasia. However, definitions and measurement methods of femoral version have varied in different studies, resulting in different "normal" values being used by clinicians for what should be the same anatomic measurement. This could result in discrepant or even inappropriate treatment recommendations.

Questions/Purposes

In patients undergoing hip preservation surgery, (1) what is the range of acetabular and femoral version at presentation, and how much do two commonly used measurement techniques (those of Murphy and Reikerås) differ? (2) How are differences in acetabular and femoral version associated with clinical factors and outcomes scores at the time of presentation?

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data gathered in a longitudinally maintained database of patients undergoing hip preservation at a tertiary care referral center. Between June 2020 and December 2021, 282 hips in 258 patients were treated for an isolated labral tear (9% [26 hips]), hip dysplasia (21% [59 hips]), FAI (52% [147 hips]), mixed FAI and dysplasia (17% [47 hips]), or pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 1% [3 hips]) with hip arthroscopy (71% [200 hips]), periacetabular osteotomy (26% [74 hips]), surgical hip dislocation (2.5% [7 hips]), or femoral derotation osteotomy (0.5% [1 hip]). We considered those with complete radiographic data (CT including the pelvis and distal femur) and patient-reported outcome scores as potentially eligible. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 or older than 55 years (5 hips, 3 patients), signs of hip osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade ≥ 2; 0), pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 3 hips, 3 patients), previous femoral or acetabular osteotomy (2 hips, 2 patients), avascular necrosis of the femoral head (0), history of neuromuscular disorder (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 3 hips, 3 patients) or rheumatoid disease (ankylosing spondylitis; 1 hip, 1 patient), and when CT did not include the knees (19 hips, 19 patients). Based on these criteria, 249 hips in 227 patients were included. Of patients with bilateral symptomatic hips, one side was randomly selected for inclusion, leaving 227 hips in 227 patients for further analysis. The patients' median age (range) was 34 years (19 to 55 years), the median BMI (range) was 27 kg/m² (16 to 55 kg/m²), and 63% (144) were female; they were treated with hip arthroscopy (in 74% [168]) or periacetabular osteotomy (in 23% [52]). Patients underwent a CT scan to measure acetabular version and femoral version using the Murphy (low < 10°; normal: 10° to 25°; high > 25°) or Reikerås (low < 5°; normal: 5° to 20°; high > 20°) technique. The McKibbin index was calculated (low: < 20°; normal: 20° to 50°; high > 50°). Based on the central acetabular version and femoral version as measured by Murphy, hips were grouped according to their rotational profile into four groups: unstable rotational profile: high (high acetabular version with high femoral version) or moderate (high acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with high femoral version); normal rotational profile (normal acetabular version with femoral version); compensatory rotational profile (low acetabular version with high femoral version or high acetabular version with low femoral version); and impingement rotational profile (low acetabular version with low femoral version): high (low acetabular version with low femoral version) or moderate (low acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with low femoral version). Radiographic assessments were manually performed on digitized images by two orthopaedic residents, and 25% of randomly selected measurements were repeated by the senior author, a fellowship-trained hip preservation and arthroplasty surgeon. Interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities were calculated using the correlation coefficient with a two-way mixed model, showing excellent agreement for Murphy technique measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.908 [95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.97]) and Reikerås technique measurements (ICC 0.938 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.97]). Patient-reported measures were recorded using the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) (0 to 100; worse to best).

Results

The mean acetabular version was 18° ± 6°, and mean femoral version was 24° ± 12° using the Murphy technique and 12° ± 11° with the Reikerås method. Eighty percent (181 of 227) of hips had normal acetabular version, 42% (96 of 227) to 63% (142 to 227) had normal femoral version per Murphy and Reikerås, respectively, and 67% (152 to 227) had a normal McKibbin index. Patients with an impingement profile (low acetabular version or femoral version) were older (39 ± 9 years) than patients with an unstable (high acetabular version or femoral version; 33 ± 9 years; p = 0.004), normal (33 ± 9 years; p = 0.02), or compensatory (high acetabular version with low femoral version or vice versa; 33 ± 7 years; p = 0.08) rotational profile. Using the Murphy technique, femoral version was 12° greater than with the Reikerås method (R² 0.85; p < 0.001). There were no differences in iHOT-33 score between different groups (impingement: 32 ± 17 versus normal 35 ± 21 versus compensated: 34 ± 20 versus unstable: 31 ± 17; p = 0.40).

Conclusion

Variability in femoral version is twice as large as acetabular version. Patients with an impingement rotational profile were older than patients with a normal, compensatory, or unstable profile, indicating there are other variables not yet fully accounted for that lead to earlier pain and presentation in these groups. Important differences exist between measurement methods. This study shows that different measurement methods for femoral anteversion result in different numbers; if other authors compare their results to those of other studies, they should use equations such as the one suggested in this study.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^bf133178]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Although several studies have demonstrated the large share of FMDs in neurology outpatients, with frequencies ranging from 15% to 33% [1, 2], they are still underrepresented in neurology training programs and one of the most common reasons for referral to movement disorder specialists [3]. A possible explanation for this high referral rate is the concern about missing an 'organic' disorder; however, studies show that the number of misdiagnoses is actually low [4, 5]. This fear may also lead to unnecessary expensive laboratory and imaging tests, which cause even more delay, whilst early diagnosis seems to be one of the strongest prognostic factors for good outcome in FMD patients [6].

In the original criteria by Fahn and Williams, various clinical and historical characteristics were labeled with degrees of diagnostic certainty for FMDs, historically also called 'psychogenic', 'conversion' or 'non‐organic' disorders [7, 8]. These authors proposed to separate historical clues, such as psychiatric disturbance, abrupt onset, inconsistency over time and pain, from clinical clues, such as inconsistency, incongruence and distractibility. The historical clues were presumed to be suggestive for a diagnosis, whilst the clinical clues were used to establish a diagnosis of an FMD. Over the years, various studies provided strong evidence for the historical clues female gender, educational status, early age of onset, previous expansion to a disease model, paroxysmal disease course, dissociative symptoms, and fatigue as additional risk factors for FMD [9, 10, 11, 12], whereas limited evidence was published for employment in a health profession, witnessing an organic movement disorder in a family member, relational status and possible secondary gain [13, 14]. In addition to this expansion of historical clues, in patients with tremor and myoclonus electrophysiological testing turned out to be of value in cases where the clinical diagnosis remained uncertain [15, 16]. In the current DSM‐5 criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013), former historical clues are now called 'associated features' or 'clinical characteristics' [17]. Still, these factors are considered supportive, whereas a definite diagnosis should be based on positive clinical findings at examination showing clear evidence of incompatibility with recognized neurological disease.

For children, "HFE testing of the other parent is generally recommended, because if results are normal, the child is an obligate heterozygote and need not undergo further testing because there is no increased risk of iron loading".

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^d5d1a35e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Reporting results for rare forms of HFE- or non-HFE-related HH

General information on requirements for variant reporting can be found in appropriate nomenclature guidelines. It is recommended that Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) convention is followed when reporting variants and unclassified variants. Information on previously described variants can be found in available databases, however, the creation of locus-specific databases listing pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants is encouraged. The following represents some basic guidelines for reporting test results based on possible scenarios.

Reporting on a known causative variant in the tested genes (HFE2 (HJV), HAMP, TFR2 or SLC40A1) in an affected index case

The report should state that a causative variant(s) has been detected and that this confirms the clinical diagnosis.

The report should include a description of the reason why a particular variant(s) is considered causative, drawing on all relevant supporting data including the scientific published data.

Determination of the parental origin of the detected variant(s) is advised.

Predictive/carrier testing of relatives at risk should be offered after appropriate genetic counselling.

Ferroportin disease exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance associated with, in its usual form (type A), hepatic and splenic iron overload in the absence of increased TS. In the type B form, its phenotype mimics that of classical HH. Heterozygous SLC40A1 variants may be sufficient to cause these particular phenotypes and this should be taken into account when conducting family screening.

Reporting on a novel variant in the tested genes (HFE, HFE2 [HJV], HAMP, TFR2 or SLC40A1) in an affected index case

If the genetic testing procedure has identified an unclassified variant as the only sequence change, this should be interpreted according to reporting of unclassified variants guidelines.

### Neuroimaging biomarkers for friedreich ataxia: a cross-sectional analysis of the TRACK-FA study [^0800272a]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Design and Participants

Baseline enrolment and testing was completed over 30 months between February 2021 and August 2023 (exceeding the originally planned 18‐month recruitment period because of the coronavirus pandemic). Individuals with genetically confirmed Friedreich ataxia, who met inclusion criteria (age of disease onset ≤ 25 years; disease duration ≤ 25 years; Functional Staging for Ataxia Scale [FSS]score ≤ 5; modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale [mFARS]score ≤ 65; absence of other neurological conditions), and matched controls (absence of diagnosed psychiatric or neurological conditions), were recruited from multiple international sites (Table 1). For both groups, a further inclusion criterion was ≥ 5 years of age at enrolment; exclusion criteria were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications, metallic dental braces, and pregnancy. The recruitment target was ~300 participants (200 with Friedreich ataxia and ~100 controls). Controls were recruited based on age (± 2 years), sex, handedness as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, and years of education (± 2 years). The Friedreich ataxia:control matching ratio was 2:1 for participants age ≥ 11 years and 1:1 for 5 to 10 years of age. These ratios were selected because rapid nervous system development in young children requires more precise matching, and because the number of children age 5 to 10 years was expected to be relatively small (~10% of total enrolment). The published TRACK‐FA protocol reports on ethics committees, approval numbers, and dates. Participants or their surrogates provided written informed consent before enrolment.

TABLE 1
TRACK‐FA participant characteristics

Procedures and Outcomes

The TRACK‐FA protocol was previously published. Briefly, the study visit involved clinical, mood and cognitive assessments, blood draws, and magnetic resonance (MR) scan of brain and spinal cord. Participants followed study procedures according to their age group (5–7, 8–10, 11–17, and ≥ 18 years old). The protocol for the 5‐ to 7‐year‐old and 8‐ to 10‐year‐old age groups differed only according to specific secondary outcome measures not reported here, so these groups are combined as the 5‐ to 10‐year‐old group. Self‐reported demographic and medical history data were collected from participants. For participants with Friedreich ataxia, genetic information and disease duration were collected. Data collection was standardized, with sites receiving extensive training and the same written study protocol.

### The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes:' red flags' for the clinician [^0dc09f1a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

MRI can be of great use in guiding the differential diagnosis between juvenile HD and metal accumulation disorders. PKAN is associated with the pathognomonic 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign, characterised by a central region of hyperintensity surrounded by a rim of hypointensity on coronal or axial T 2 *-weighted images in the globus pallidus. This abnormality is highly correlated with the presence of PANK2 gene mutations, even in the presymptomatic phase. Other brain metal accumulation disorders, such as PLAN, Kufor–Rakeb syndrome, aceruloplasminemia (iron) and WD (copper) show mainly hypointense pallidal signal without central hyperintensity and, less commonly, iron deposition in the substantia nigra, especially in PLAN and Kufor–Rakeb syndrome. In NBIAs, typically, globus pallidus and substantia nigra appear involved on T 2 * and fast spin echo MRI scans, with also dentate involvement seen on T 2 *-weighted images. Interestingly, nigral pathology in PLAN and Kufor–Rakeb syndrome seems related to the presence of a PD-like Parkinsonism which responds to L-dopa, and may even be complicated with L-dopa-induced dyskinesias.MRI, however, may also be completely normal in these disorders.

Finally, other ancillary investigations provide limited additional aid to the diagnostic work-up. The confirmation of a concurrent peripheral neuropathy or myopathy in chorea-acanthocytosis or McLeod syndrome may require a routine electromyographic or electroneurographic study. Evoked potentials may be of some use to demonstrate degeneration of posterior columns in spinocerebellar degenerative ataxias, mainly SCA17 and FA. Muscle imaging, particularly CT, may unveil fatty changes, associated with neurogenic atrophy on biopsy, in patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome.

3 Results

Demographic characteristics and the analyses of follow up times of the cohort are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline demographics and follow up characteristics by onset group, and ambulation status during enrolment and follow up time.

The FA-COMS study has minimal enrolment criteriaand recruits a diverse cohort, including individuals with well-established disease who were non-ambulatory at enrolment, as well as a large number of newly diagnosed, ambulatory individuals with early onset. When stratified by age of onset (< 15y, 15–24y, > 24y), the groups were similar in sex and presence or absence of point mutations (Table 1). We also present the cohort by different temporal aspects of disease, i.e. the baseline status of measures, mirroring the censoring status in the analyses: Enrolled non-ambulatory (left-censored), LoA during follow up (interval censored) and ambulatory at last visit (right censored). This is reflected in age and duration differences between these three groups.

Patients with Fabry disease (FD) are at a high risk for developing chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The availability of specific but costly therapy has elevated the profile of this rare condition. This KDIGO conference addressed controversial areas in the diagnosis, screening, and management of FD, and included enzyme replacement therapy and nonspecific standard-of-care therapy for the various manifestations of FD.

The emergence of numerous cases of this condition raised concern that perhaps there were undiagnosed FANS cases in other patients with FA that we have cared for. Systematic review was performed on all available brain imaging from patients with FA at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Minnesota (data not shown). Comprehensive review was performed for 34 patients, including evaluation of 132 brain MRI and 90 head computed tomography scans. This cohort of patients had a median age of 11 years (range, 1–31), with a wide range of reasons for pursuing imaging, including but not limited to infectious concerns, tumor screening, vascular concerns, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt evaluation, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. This internal review did not reveal any asymptomatic patients with abnormal imaging nor incidental findings consistent with FANS. This suggests that routine screening for FANS with intracranial imaging, in the absence of symptoms, is unlikely to be beneficial.

In this report, we highlight a previously undescribed aspect of the FA phenotype, FANS. The neurologic symptoms present in pediatric patients and young adults and appear to be independent of bone marrow transplant, because 1 patient in our cohort did not receive transplant. Radiographic appearances can be mistaken for aggressive CNS malignancy, so recognition of this distinct, insidious process is paramount to avoid unnecessary exposure to detrimental chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment in this vulnerable patient population. As our clinical awareness around this neurodegenerative process in FA improves, we hope to gain a greater understanding of its natural course and importantly, effective therapy.
