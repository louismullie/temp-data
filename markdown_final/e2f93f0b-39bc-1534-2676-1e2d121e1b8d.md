## Question

What is the new name for alcoholic liver disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the new name for alcoholic liver disease is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to a rebranding of alcoholic liver disease itself versus the broader steatotic liver disease nomenclature changes. Then, I should verify the most authoritative, recent consensus statements and guidelines. Next, I will check whether "alcoholic liver disease" was actually renamed or if a new umbrella term and subcategories were introduced. Finally, I will synthesize a precise answer and clarify the terminology so there's no confusion going forward.

> Let me first confirm the context. The recent high-profile nomenclature shift pertains to steatotic liver disease as a whole, replacing "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)" with "metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)" and introducing "MetALD" for the overlap of metabolic dysfunction with increased alcohol intake, while alcohol-related liver disease itself remains a distinct entity under the new umbrella rather than being renamed per se [^112ykdd1] [^notfound] [^116pUXU3].

> Wait, let me verify the exact status of "alcoholic liver disease" in the new framework. The multisociety Delphi consensus explicitly retains alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) as a separate category under the overarching steatotic liver disease (SLD) construct, and it introduces MetALD to capture patients with MASLD who consume more than minimal alcohol, rather than renaming ALD itself [^112E3aBE] [^116pUXU3] [^116pUXU3].

> I should confirm the rationale and timing. The 2023–2024 consensus process, endorsed by AASLD, EASL, and ALEH, aimed to reduce stigma and align terminology with pathophysiology. It replaced NAFLD with MASLD, created MetALD for the metabolic-plus-alcohol overlap, and kept ALD as a distinct etiologic category, which means ALD did not get a new name; it was organized within a new hierarchical system rather than rebranded [^112E3aBE] [^notfound] [^112ykdd1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some might say "the new name is alcohol-associated liver disease", but I need to check whether that is truly a change. In fact, "alcohol-associated liver disease" has been the preferred phrasing in several guidelines for years already (for example, AASLD 2019–2020), so using "alcohol-associated" instead of "alcoholic" is not a 2023–2024 innovation; the 2023 consensus primarily reorganized the steatotic liver disease taxonomy rather than renaming ALD itself [^113vXZDg] [^112zX6r3] [^112E3aBE].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. There is no entirely new name for alcoholic liver disease; the correct, currently preferred terminology is alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which remains a distinct category under the steatotic liver disease umbrella, alongside MASLD and MetALD. If the question was prompted by the broader nomenclature update, that change specifically replaced NAFLD with MASLD and added MetALD, not ALD [^112ykdd1] [^112E3aBE] [^114MqRKn].

> I should double-check the practical implication so we don't misapply labels. Clinically, we now classify patients with steatosis as MASLD when metabolic risk factors are present and alcohol intake is below the defined thresholds, as MetALD when both metabolic risk and higher alcohol intake coexist, and as ALD when alcohol is the predominant driver without metabolic features; this framework better captures dual-etiology disease without renaming ALD itself [^112E3aBE] [^114MqRKn].

---

The new name for alcoholic liver disease is **alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)** [^113vXZDg], adopted to reduce stigma and better reflect the disease's pathophysiology [^113HmDja]. This change aligns with the broader shift to **steatotic liver disease (SLD)** [^112ykdd1] as an umbrella term, under which ALD is a distinct category alongside metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [^112E3aBE]. The terminology update emphasizes alcohol as a key driver and supports clearer communication and care pathways [^116pUXU3].

---

## Rationale for the nomenclature change

The change from "alcoholic liver disease" to "alcohol-associated liver disease" is driven by several considerations:

- **Reduction of stigma**: The term "alcoholic" carries significant social stigma, which can negatively impact patient engagement, treatment adherence, and outcomes. By adopting "alcohol-associated", the medical community aims to foster a more supportive and non-judgmental environment for patients [^113HmDja].

- **Accuracy and clarity**: The new terminology more accurately reflects the disease's pathophysiology, emphasizing the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and liver injury. It also aligns with the broader shift towards etiologically descriptive nomenclature in hepatology [^116pUXU3].

- **Consistency with modern classification systems**: The change aligns with the recent reclassification of fatty liver diseases under the umbrella term "steatotic liver disease (SLD)", which includes metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) [^112ykdd1].

---

## Clinical implications of the new nomenclature

The adoption of "alcohol-associated liver disease" has several clinical implications:

- **Improved patient engagement**: Reducing stigma may encourage patients to seek care earlier, adhere to treatment, and engage in alcohol cessation programs, ultimately improving outcomes [^notfound].

- **Enhanced clinical communication**: The new terminology provides a clearer framework for clinicians to discuss the disease's etiology, progression, and management with patients and their families [^1123Yzx5].

- **Alignment with treatment strategies**: The terminology reinforces the central role of alcohol cessation in disease management, aligning clinical practice with evidence-based guidelines that prioritize abstinence and integrated care for alcohol use disorder (AUD) [^112zX6r3].

## Comparison with previous terminology

| **Aspect** | **Previous terminology (alcoholic liver disease)** | **New terminology (alcohol-associated liver disease)** |
|-|-|-|
| Stigma | High, due to the term "alcoholic" | Reduced, with "alcohol-associated" |
| Clinical accuracy | General, less specific | More specific, etiologically descriptive |
| Patient engagement | Often hindered by stigma | Potentially improved |
| Clinical communication | Less precise | Clearer, more descriptive |
| Alignment with modern classification | Limited | Fully aligned with SLD framework |

---

## Broader context: steatotic liver disease (SLD)

The reclassification of ALD is part of a larger effort to standardize nomenclature across fatty liver diseases. The umbrella term **steatotic liver disease (SLD)** now encompasses:

- **Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)**: Previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), this category includes patients with hepatic steatosis and metabolic risk factors [^112E3aBE].

- **Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH)**: The progressive form of MASLD, equivalent to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [^111p82U5].

- **Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)**: A distinct category for liver disease primarily driven by alcohol consumption [^116pUXU3].

This new framework aims to improve disease awareness, facilitate research, and enhance clinical care by providing a more precise and clinically relevant classification system [^112ykdd1].

---

## Conclusion

The new name for alcoholic liver disease is **alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)** [^113vXZDg]. This change reflects a broader effort to reduce stigma, improve patient engagement, and align terminology with modern classification systems. The adoption of ALD within the steatotic liver disease (SLD) framework [^112ykdd1] underscores the importance of alcohol as a key driver of liver disease and supports clearer clinical communication and care pathways [^116pUXU3].

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidance — purpose and scope describe alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) as a spectrum from hepatic steatosis to alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC), and acute AH presenting as acute-on-chronic liver failure, with progression dependent on continued heavy alcohol use and risk factors including female sex, genetic susceptibility, diet, and comorbid liver disease.

It states that "This 2019 ALD Guidance provides a data-supported approach to the prevalence, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and clinical management of ALD and alcohol use disorders (AUDs)", developed by expert panel consensus, and that the quality and strength of guidance statements "are not formally rated"; updates to the prior guidance include emphasis on AUD definition, screening and treatment, new alcohol biomarkers, and additional genetic and environmental susceptibility factors.

### A call to standardize definitions, data collection, and outcome assessment to improve care in alcohol-related liver disease [^116vVb9f]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is highly prevalent and appears to be increasingly reported with worsening mortality; thus, optimizing care in this patient population is imperative. This will require a multidisciplinary, multifaceted approach that includes recognizing alcohol use disorder (AUD) and existing treatments for AUD. We must also acknowledge the full spectrum of ALD clinically and histologically. For example, our current clinical definitions of alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) do not address that > 95% of severe AH occurs in the setting of cirrhosis with < 60% of liver explants having hepatitis. Given that the majority of ALD studies rely on clinical diagnosis and lack pathologic confirmation, prior data on the efficacy of medical treatment or use of transplantation are likely limited by intertrial and intratrial heterogeneity. Added limitations of the current field include the inconsistent reporting of relapse with the use of varying definitions and unreliable assessments. Moreover, studies fail to consistently capture the data variables that likely influence the main outcomes of interest in this population-mortality and relapse-and a global effort to create a standardized data collection tool moving forward could help effectively and efficiently aid in the advancement of this field. Conclusion: To optimize patient care and make best use of a limited resource, a systematic change in the approach to research in this population must be undertaken that creates consistent definitions for use in future research to generate reliable and reproducible results. With this in mind, we concisely reviewed the literature to summarize the current state of treating and managing ALD, the heterogeneity in definitions, and the significant opportunities for clinical and research improvement.

Alcoholic hepatitis — proposed definitions and subtypes categorize cases as definite, probable, and possible. Definite alcoholic hepatitis requires histological confirmation of features of alcoholic hepatitis. Probable alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on (a) heavy alcohol use for > 5 years, (b) active alcohol use until 4 weeks prior to presentation, (c) sudden onset or worsening of jaundice, and (d) AST/ALT ratio > 1.5:1 with levels < 400IU/L, with (e) absence of other causes of liver disease. Possible alcoholic hepatitis reflects diagnostic uncertainty due to another confounding etiology of liver disease or unclear history on alcohol consumption.

INTRODUCTION

Unified global approaches to nomenclature and disease definition are critical for increasing disease awareness, driving policy change, identifying those at risk, and facilitating diagnosis and access to care. Language can create or exacerbate stigma, marginalise segments of the affected population, and, ultimately, contribute to health inequalities. It has been known for many years that being overweight or obese is associated with hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte injury, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. This was formally recognised by the term "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis" in 1980 by Jurgen Ludwig. Subsequently, the term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was used to describe the histological spectrum of steatosis to steatohepatitis with its subtypes NAFL and NASH. The histological classification was further expanded on by various scoring systems categorising steatosis, disease activity, and fibrosis. – This framework has served as the anchor for our current understanding of the disease, data on the burden of the disease, and efforts to develop a treatment for the condition.

While the nomenclature is widely used, it has always been appreciated that the term "nonalcoholic" did not accurately capture what the aetiology of the disease was, and notably, the term "fatty" has been considered to be stigmatising by some. Furthermore, there are individuals with risk factors for NAFLD, such as type 2 diabetes, who consume more alcohol than the relatively strict thresholds used to define the nonalcoholic nature of the disease, which are not adequately recognised by existing nomenclature and are excluded from trials and consideration for treatments. Indeed, there is a recognition now that there are overlapping biological processes that may contribute to both NAFLD and alcohol-associated/related liver disease (ALD). All of these factors have led to growing dissatisfaction with the current nomenclature. This was summarised in a paper by Eslam et al, in 2020 and led to the proposal to use the term metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which includes patients with a fatty liver regardless of the amount and pattern of alcohol intake under this terminology. While MAFLD was accepted by some, concerns were raised about the mixing of etiologies, continued use of the term "fatty" considered stigmatising by many, and restricting the population to those with 2 metabolic risk factors and allowance of more liberal alcohol use, thus impacting our understanding of natural history. – One area of particular concern was the potential negative impact of changes in diagnostic criteria for the disease in terms of biomarker and therapeutic development.

Patient and public partnership involvement

The quality standards group included a representative from the British Liver Trust (VH) and a patient representative (VL).

Terminology used in the document for ALD, and cirrhosis due to (ALD cirrhosis) is based on the most recent guideline document from the European society for the study of the liver, which recognised that use of the word 'alcoholic' is stigmatising and sought to move away from its use. We have also used the term alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) to replace the previous term alcoholic hepatitis.

### Progress is impossible without change: understanding the evolving nomenclature of steatotic liver disease and its effect on hepatology practice [^113HmDja]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The American, European, and Latin American liver societies have proposed a change in the nomenclature we use to describe alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, a term encompassing both is now advocated: steatotic liver disease, which includes metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and MASLD with greater alcohol consumption (MetALD). These classifications offer increased relevance for clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the basis for this nomenclature shift and how it was developed. We also explore the challenges that will be faced in the adoption of such change. The proposed change seeks to banish stigma associated with phrasing such as alcoholic and fatty. However stigma, particularly related to the term fatty, is culturally nuanced, and reflects different entities depending on location. If such a change is internationally accepted, there will be wide-reaching effects on practitioners in primary care and metabolic medicine, and on patients. We discuss those effects and the opportunities the nomenclature change could offer, particularly for patients with alcohol and metabolic risk factors who represent a group previously ignored by clinical trials.

### From NAFLD to MAFLD: implications of a premature change in terminology [^114G4NQY]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the substantial gains in our understanding of NAFLD/NASH over the past 2 decades, there has been some dissatisfaction with the terminology "non-alcoholic" which overemphasizes "alcohol" and underemphasizes the root cause of this liver disease, namely, the predisposing metabolic risk factors. As a potential remedy, a name change from NAFLD to metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed. Although MAFLD reflects the relevant risk factors for this liver disease, this term is still suboptimal, leaving a great deal of ambiguity. Here, we caution that changing the name without understanding its broad implications can have a negative impact on the field. In this context, changing the terminology without new understanding of the molecular basis of the disease entity, new insights in risk stratification or other important aspect of this liver disease, can create unnecessary confusion which could negatively impact the field. At a time when the field is facing substantial challenges around disease awareness as well as clarity of acceptable endpoints for drug development and biomarker discovery, changing the terminology from one suboptimal name to another suboptimal name without full assessment is expected to deepen these challenges. In the context of this debate about terminology, we recommend the creation of a true international consensus group to include all the relevant scientific liver societies (AASLD, EASL, ALEH, APASL), patient advocacy organizations, bio-pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies and policy makers. A consensus meeting must assess the impact and consequences of changing the terminology based on the available evidence and make recommendations that will move the field forward. By this approach, a true collaborative international and inclusive consensus can be adopted by all stakeholders dealing with this important global liver disease.

### The intersection between alcohol-related liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113ah5Ec]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) are the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD and ALD share pathophysiological, histological and genetic features and both alcohol and metabolic dysfunction coexist as aetiological factors in many patients with hepatic steatosis. A diagnosis of NAFLD requires the exclusion of significant alcohol consumption and other causes of liver disease. However, data suggest that significant alcohol consumption is often under-reported in patients classified as having NAFLD and that alcohol and metabolic factors interact to exacerbate the progression of liver disease. In this Review, we analyse existing data on the interaction between alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome as well as the overlapping features and differences in the pathogenesis of ALD and NAFLD. We also discuss the clinical implications of the coexistence of alcohol consumption, of any degree, in patients with evidence of metabolic derangement as well as the use of alcohol biomarkers to detect alcohol intake. Finally, we summarize the evolving nomenclature of fatty liver disease and describe a recent proposal to classify patients at the intersection of NAFLD and ALD. We propose that, regardless of the presumed aetiology, patients with fatty liver disease should be evaluated for both metabolic syndrome and alcohol consumption to enable better prognostication and a personalized medicine approach.

### Alcoholic liver disease: mechanisms of injury and targeted treatment [^115jC9a2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex process that includes a wide spectrum of hepatic lesions, from steatosis to cirrhosis. Cell injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, regeneration and bacterial translocation are key drivers of alcohol-induced liver injury. Alcoholic hepatitis is the most severe form of all the alcohol-induced liver lesions. Animal models of ALD mainly involve mild liver damage (that is, steatosis and moderate inflammation), whereas severe alcoholic hepatitis in humans occurs in the setting of cirrhosis and is associated with severe liver failure. For this reason, translational studies using humans and human samples are crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Although multiple attempts have been made to improve patient outcome, the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is still based on abstinence from alcohol and brief exposure to corticosteroids. However, nearly 40% of patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis will not benefit from treatment. We suggest that future clinical trials need to focus on end points other than mortality. This Review discusses the main pathways associated with the progression of liver disease, as well as potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^112zX6r3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States". Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD". "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver". Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD", and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC".

### Liver transplantation for alcohol-related liver disease in the UK: revised UK liver advisory group recommendations for referral [^116nZN5c]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Liver disease, of which liver cirrhosis is the most advanced stage, constitutes the fourth most common cause of life-years lost in men and women younger than 75 years in England, where mortality rates from liver disease have increased by 25% in the past decade. Alcohol consumption is the most common modifiable risk factor for disease progression in these individuals, but within the UK, there is substantial variation in the distribution, prevalence, and outcome of alcohol-related liver disease, and no equity of access to tertiary transplantation services. These revised recommendations were agreed by an expert panel convened by the UK Liver Advisory Group, with the purpose of providing consensus on referral for transplant assessment in patients with alcohol-related disease, and clarifying the terminology and definitions of alcohol use in liver injury. By standardising clinical management in these patients, it is hoped that there will be an improvement in the quality of care and better access to liver transplant assessment for patients with alcohol-related liver disease in the UK.

### MAFLD: what 2 years of the redefinition of fatty liver disease has taught us [^1155YRMJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential pitfalls of the new definition: consensus not yet achieved

Critical comments on the new MAFLD definition substituting NAFLD terminology appeared from several groups around the world especially from the United States. Younossi et al. claimed that such a terminology is currently premature. These authors estimate that the current definition of NAFLD overemphasizes the absence of alcohol use and certainly underemphasizes the relevance of metabolic disturbances and risk factors. They also comment that the term NASH adds complexity as it needs liver histology and is associated with a high intra-/inter-observer variability. In our opinion, two of the most crucial points are that both alcohol consumption and assessment of liver inflammation reflect demanding issues of this disease whatever definition will be used today and in the future. This is also supported by the recent study from Vienna as discussed before demonstrating that approximately 25% of also MAFLD patients consume too much alcohol. Another major problem discussed by Younossi et al. reflect current and past clinical trials in this field with well-established clinical and histological endpoints which would need to be adapted when using the new definition. How should endpoints of clinical trials be defined when using the new MAFLD definition? NAFLD-associated HCC might reflect another difficult topic. Vitale et al. recently presented data from the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA. Li.CA) group. Vitale et al. reported not only that in the next years MAFLD will become the main underlying disease in HCC and also showed that single aetiology MAFLD might have a better prognosis compared with non-MAFLD HCC. This, however, could also be because of various confounders such as improved management of metabolic disturbances in the past years. In the accompanying commentary, Hernaez and Peck-Radosavljevic critically discussed the new term MAFLD when considering HCC. Especially they were criticizing why alcoholic liver disease should not be a separate disease but is now defined as a subgroup within the unspecific term MAFLD. Another challenge with the new definition appears that the new MAFLD definition has a very low specificity for the detection of patients with a higher HCC risk, making surveillance in this population impossible. Chen et al. observed when assessing adults from the NHANES III study (1988–1994) that there were no differences between normal controls and patients with non-MAFLD steatosis or MAFLD with respect to clinical outcome. In this study, MAFLD was not associated with all-cause mortality, but subjects with lean MAFLD and diabetic MAFLD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality proposing that further subclassification of MAFLD might be needed. Semmler et al. also found that MAFLD was not associated with an increase in mortality. Interestingly, they also observed that rather lean MAFLD had a worse prognosis, but again this association was probably confounded by age and associated metabolic disorders such as T2D.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^113B5eLp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis — liver biopsy role and classification indicate that a NIH-sponsored consensus proposed defining AH as definite, probable, or possible based on clinical features, confounding serology for other liver disease etiology, and liver histology; definite AH was categorized as a compatible clinical diagnosis with liver biopsy confirming the existence of criteria of AH, probable AH as classic clinical syndrome without confounding serology, and possible AH as clinically suspicious with confounding factors or uncertain alcohol use. It was proposed that patients with possible AH should undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, especially if specific pharmacologic interventions are proposed.

### Treating alcohol-related liver disease from a public health perspective [^111R3bs2]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Herein, we describe the evolving landscape of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) including the current global burden of disease and cost to working-aged people in terms of death and disability, in addition to the larger spectrum of alcohol-related heath complications and its wider impact on society. We further review the most effective and cost-effective public health policies at both a population and individual level. Currently, abstinence is the only effective treatment for ALD, and yet because the majority of ALD remains undetected in the community abstinence is initiated too late to prevent premature death in the majority of cases. We therefore hope that this review will help inform clinicians of the "public health treatment options" for ALD to encourage engagement with policy makers and promote community-based hepatology as a speciality, expanding our patient cohort to allow early detection, and thereby a reduction in the enormous morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^117412Xm]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Considerations for disease definition

Respondents were asked their opinion regarding the concept of steatohepatitis as an important entity, and 95% of respondents felt that the presence of steatohepatitis had prognostic implications and should remain an important distinction. In addition, given the role of "resolution of steatohepatitis" as one of the 2 European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvable endpoints, 93% felt that it should remain for both clinical practice and trial endpoints. The current definition of NAFLD excludes the consumption of > 20 g/30 g of alcohol per day in females and males, respectively, with a more liberal approach to concomitant alcohol use proposed in the original MAFLD definition. To establish the permissibility of greater alcohol consumption, several questions were asked to better understand the impact of alcohol on the natural history of the disease and also how to characterise various levels of alcohol use in the definition. A supermajority felt that consumption of 30–60 g of alcohol daily in the setting of NAFLD alters the natural history of the disease (95%) and may alter the response to therapeutic interventions (90%). Furthermore, 90% felt that individuals with steatosis related to CMRFs who consume more than minimal alcohol (30–60 g daily) represented an important group that should be considered in a different disease category and studied independently.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^114MqRKn]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The principal limitations of the terms NAFLD and NASH are the reliance on exclusionary confounder terms and the use of potentially stigmatising language. This study set out to determine if content experts and patient advocates were in favor of a change in nomenclature and/or definition. A modified Delphi process was led by three large pan-national liver associations. The consensus was defined a priori as a supermajority (67%) vote. An independent committee of experts external to the nomenclature process made the final recommendation on the acronym and its diagnostic criteria. A total of 236 panelists from 56 countries participated in 4 online surveys and 2 hybrid meetings. Response rates across the 4 survey rounds were 87%, 83%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt that the current nomenclature was sufficiently flawed to consider a name change. The terms "nonalcoholic" and "fatty" were felt to be stigmatising by 61% and 66% of respondents, respectively. Steatotic liver disease was chosen as an overarching term to encompass the various aetiologies of steatosis. The term steatohepatitis was felt to be an important pathophysiological concept that should be retained. The name chosen to replace NAFLD was metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. There was consensus to change the definition to include the presence of at least 1 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors. Those with no metabolic parameters and no known cause were deemed to have cryptogenic steatotic liver disease. A new category, outside pure metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, termed metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease (MetALD), was selected to describe those with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, who consume greater amounts of alcohol per week (140–350 g/wk and 210–420 g/wk for females and males, respectively). The new nomenclature and diagnostic criteria are widely supported and nonstigmatising, and can improve awareness and patient identification.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113We9gQ]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Moderate alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is described and management priorities are outlined. Such patients might be classified as having moderate AH (which would be defined as having a MELD ≤ 20 or MDF < 32). Although there is no well-established therapy for these patients, medical attention should focus on the diagnosis of disease, patient education, referral, and interdisciplinary management of these patients with AUD treatment specialists to achieve alcohol cessation. Early detection of "subclinical" ALD and prevention of progression to AC should be a management goal in both the primary care setting as well as in hepatology referrals.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^116pUXU3]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This process focuses on the nomenclature and definition of NAFLD rather than a determination of what constitutes hepatic steatosis or assessment of disease severity. There is extensive literature on the confirmation of hepatic steatosis, which we did not seek to interrogate; often, this is a pragmatic determination in clinical practice, which is where this guidance starts. Moreover, this nomenclature process, in line with published guidance, is not advocating for the routine use of tests to confirm hepatic steatosis although, in reality, most, if not all, patients will usually have imaging at some point. Finally, we recognise it is the evaluation of fibrosis either as part of screening strategies or individual clinical decisions, which is relevant for most clinical settings. That remains unchanged after this process, other than the name (eg, MASLD with advanced fibrosis).

Contrary to the initial proposal by Eslam and colleagues, the Delphi process revealed that most experts consider that MetALD patients should be classified in a category distinct from MASLD, mainly because of the added pathogenic value of alcohol consumption and consequential prognostic implications. The condition MetALD provides an opportunity to better define the natural history of such patients and the development of biomarkers and therapies that are currently lacking for this group of patients. ALD is a distinct liver disease (of which steatosis is one of the features) and, thus, is categorised under the SLD umbrella. This should raise awareness of alcohol as a driver of steatosis and highlight the impact of excessive alcohol consumption (ie, > 50–60 g daily in females and males, respectively) irrespective of their association with metabolic dysfunction. Studies have shown that, even in excessive drinkers, obesity increases the prevalence of cirrhosis, and glycaemic dysregulation increases fibrosis severity. Patterns of alcohol use must also be taken into consideration as bingeing (even within the total weekly "allowable limit" for MASLD) can be detrimental. We also recognise that objective tools are not available or sufficiently validated to determine the relative contribution of MASLD and ALD in patients with MetALD, and hence, we rely on self-reported alcohol intake, which can be inaccurate. In that regard, this is a conceptual construct and might be better seen as a disease spectrum with differing of modifiable disease drivers (CMRFs and alcohol). This is also relevant for the distinction between patients with MetALD and those drinking more heavily, which are termed as having ALD. Also, the category of ALD without metabolic factors is relatively rare among patients with significant fibrosis, but it was felt to represent part of the spectrum.

### The natural history of alcohol-related liver disease [^1174n6dr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will describe the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) in light of recent data that have synthesized existing knowledge on this topic and described new research cohorts to improve our understanding of progression and outcomes in ArLD.

Recent Findings

ArLD occurs after a threshold of alcohol consumption, but this threshold is lowered by the presence of comorbid factors of which obesity is the most common. The most common stage of ArLD is alcohol-related steatosis: this is associated with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (3%/year) and nonliver-related morbidity is more likely (4 versus 1%/year). In contrast, alcohol-related steatohepatitis or cirrhosis is more dangerous with higher rates of both nonliver and liver-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at approximately 3%/year amongst people with ArLD cirrhosis.

Summary

These data allow an understanding of ArLD to accurately counsel patients and also to guide public health policies. Awareness of the shortcomings of the available data, highlighted in a recent systematic review, will inform the design of further research in particular to describe the multiple interacting factors that may cause ArLD to regress or progress.

### A new definition for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement [^1164UyWK]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of other chronic liver diseases including "excess" alcohol intake has until now been necessary to establish a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, given our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MAFLD and its rising prevalence, "positive criteria" to diagnose the disease are required. In this work, a panel of international experts from 22 countries propose a new definition for the diagnosis of MAFLD that is both comprehensive and simple, and is independent of other liver diseases. The criteria are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis, in addition to one of the following three criteria, namely overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. We propose that disease assessment and stratification of severity should extend beyond a simple dichotomous classification to steatohepatitis vs. non-steatohepatitis. The group also suggests a set of criteria to define MAFLD-associated cirrhosis and proposes a conceptual framework to consider other causes of fatty liver disease. Finally, we bring clarity to the distinction between diagnostic criteria and inclusion criteria for research studies and clinical trials. Reaching consensus on the criteria for MAFLD will help unify the terminology (e.g. for ICD-coding), enhance the legitimacy of clinical practice and clinical trials, improve clinical care and move the clinical and scientific field of liver research forward.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^116eZ7b5]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Delphi process utilised a supermajority threshold of ≥ 67% with 2 exceptions, the consideration of stigma, and a binary question to retain or revise the current definition. While recognising that perceptions of stigma differ widely, especially across different languages and cultures, in this study, it became clear that substantial proportions of the respondents deemed terms such as "fatty" stigmatising, hence its exclusion as part of any new name. Although healthcare professionals may contend that patients have not reported this previously, this likely reflects in part a failure to ask the question in the first place and the power imbalance in the doctor-patient relationship. Moreover, a recent large study indicated that some healthcare professionals and patients considered the terms fatty and nonalcoholic to be pejorative and stigmatising. The use of medical terminology such as steatosis may at one level be seen as overmedicalising the lexicon, yet it affords patients the opportunity to disclose their condition to friends and colleagues without having to face prejudice and stigma that can be inherent to the word "fatty". Efforts to increase disease awareness have had modest success, possibly impacted by the perception that care providers deem the term "fatty liver" as describing an indolent condition. With therapeutics on the horison, there is renewed energy to identify "at-risk" patients, which, in conjunction with new terminology, may bolster awareness and a sense of importance.

The overarching term of SLD encompasses the spectrum of causes of hepatic steatosis, thus allowing precise classification once a specific aetiology has been identified. The new names also allow for further characterisation of fibrotic severity, for example, MASH with stage 3 fibrosis. Disease staging and severity are not altered by this process although it is anticipated that, in the near to medium term, disease staging will be achieved using noninvasive tests, which can be incorporated into further clarifications of disease stage. Thus, the current consensus process does not deviate from prior case definitions for steatohepatitis and disease stages. The diagnosis of MASLD/MASH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, when steatosis may not be present, will be based on existing agreed criteria for NASH cirrhosis. This also applies to patients with MetALD and ALD with significant fibrosis who may not have steatosis yet have SLD as part of the overarching nomenclature, reflecting the mechanism of injury.

DISCUSSION

Identification of a new name and definition for the condition formerly known as NAFLD has been a challenging process given the broad range of global stakeholders. It is imperative that any new proposal is sufficiently better than the existing nomenclature, and it enhances awareness, understanding of the disease, without negatively impacting drug/biomarker development. This robust, representative, patient-centric Delphi process systematically addressed all the issues and views over the past years and, through consensus, has arrived at both a new name and a refined definition. By inclusion of patient advocacy groups throughout the entire process, the new nomenclature strives to accelerate disease awareness while minimising stigma associated with the use of terms perceived as stigmatising by some patients and their caregivers.

Several important findings emerged from the nomenclature consensus process; there was clear support for a name change, the use of an overarching term that could accommodate the evolution of disease understanding, and the use of a metabolic descriptor in the new nomenclature. Both the overarching term of SLD and the more specific MASLD provide an affirmative nonstigmatising description of the condition rather than a diagnosis of exclusion. This is also seen in the definition, which requires the presence of at least 1 CMRF in addition to hepatic steatosis. The proposed nomenclature is not intended to be static but rather allows the flexibility for refinement as new evidence emerges about underlying pathophysiology and risk factors.

A key consideration is the preservation of existing data on natural history, biomarkers, and clinical trials as part of these changes. To address the impact of the refined definition, an analysis of the LITMUS consortium European was performed, which demonstrated that 98% of the existing registry cohort of patients with NAFLD would fulfill the new criteria for MASLD. Conceptually patients with the previous definition (NAFLD) can now be seen to be completely covered by the categories of MASLD and possible MASLD. The introduction of a separate MetALD subcategory where metabolic and alcohol-associated risk factors coexist sits outside MASLD/NAFLD and is an opportunity to generate new knowledge for this common group of patients. In addition, maintenance of the term, and clinical definition, of steatohepatitis ensures retention and validity of prior data from clinical trials and biomarker discovery studies of patients with NASH to be generalisable to individuals classified as MASLD or MASH under the new nomenclature, without impeding the efficiency of research.

METHODS

Panel generation and statement development

The panel for this Delphi study was generated through an iterative, inclusive process involving diverse liver organisations around the world (Table 1). The Steering Committee (n = 36) was composed of 2 co-chairs (Mary E. Rinella and Philip N Newsome), representing AASLD and EASL, respectively, and 34 other members nominated by their respective associations with a view to ensuring broad geographic representation.

TABLE 1
Delphi panel characteristics (N = 225)

The consensus process used a modified Delphi method – to incorporate input from the literature and a diverse group of content experts, practitioners, and patient advocates. The steering committee identified 5 areas deemed fundamental to the consideration of a revised nomenclature, namely: (1) What are issues with the current nomenclature, and can they be addressed? (2) What is the importance of steatohepatitis in disease definition and endpoints? (3) How should the role of alcohol be accounted for? (4) How might a name change impact disease awareness, clinical trials, and regulatory approval pathways? and (5) Can an alternative name reduce heterogeneity and allow for future advances? Between late 2021 and early 2022, the steering committee was divided into 6 working groups, each with a designated lead (Sven M. Francque, Mary E. Rinella, Philip N Newsome, Arun J. Sanyal, Vlad Ratziu, and Fasiha Kanwal), responsible for reviews of the literature to inform the development of draft statements for their assigned topic area: patient-centered perspective (Sven M. Francque); pros and cons of the current nomenclature (Mary E. Rinella); defining fatty liver disease in the setting of metabolic dysfunction (Philip N Newsome); disease heterogeneity (Arun J. Sanyal); histopathology (Vlad Ratziu); and how to manage the role of alcohol in dual aetiology (Fasiha Kanwal). The preliminary draft statements were compiled and shared with the larger steering committee for review, and the feedback was incorporated into a revised set of draft consensus statements (Supplemental Table S1).

### NAFLD vs MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease)-why the need for a change of nomenclature? [^115w4Dqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Several reasons led to the change in the nomenclature from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); the most important being limitations due to the reliance on exclusionary confounder terms and the use of potentially stigmatizing language (the terms "nonalcoholic" and "fatty"). The new name was decided through a Delphi process and now includes in the name, and definition, the metabolic origin (the presence of at least 1 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors) without the stigmatizing terms. The recognition of a new category termed "metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease" (MetALD) opens up a new area for exploration although the relative contribution of alcohol and metabolic risk factors requires further evaluation as does the evidencing at a patient rather than population level.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^113kVZ5f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

### Advances in the understanding and management of alcohol-related liver disease [^113BtqwE]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological trends indicate recent and predicted increases in the burden of disease. Disease progression is driven by continued alcohol exposure on a background of genetic predisposition together with environmental cofactors. Most individuals present with advanced disease despite a long history of excessive alcohol consumption and multiple missed opportunities to intervene. Increasing evidence supports the use of non-invasive tests to screen for and identify disease at earlier stages. There is a definite role for public health measures to reduce the overall burden of disease. At an individual level, however, the ability to influence subsequent disease course by modifying alcohol consumption or the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains limited due to a comparative lack of effective, disease-modifying medical interventions. Abstinence from alcohol is the key determinant of outcome in established ALD and the cornerstone of clinical management. In those with decompensated ALD, liver transplant has a clear role. There is consensus that abstinence from alcohol for an arbitrary period should not be the sole determinant in a decision to transplant. An increasing understanding of the mechanisms by which alcohol causes liver disease in susceptible individuals offers the prospect of new therapeutic targets for disease-modifying drugs. Successful translation will require significant public and private investment in a disease area which has traditionally been underfunded when compared to its overall prevalence.

These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (i) a formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic (Medline search); (ii) American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines (1); (iii) guideline policies, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Policy on the development and use of practice guidelines and the AGA Policy Statement on Guidelines (2); and (iv) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to the standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. To more fully characterize the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations, the Practice Guideline Committee of the AASLD requires a Class (reflecting the benefit vs. risk) and Level (assessing the strength or certainty) of Evidence to be assigned and reported with each recommendation (Table 1, adapted from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Practice Guidelines) (3,4).

Emergence of novel nomenclature and a research and action agenda roadmap

The new nomenclature has made the use of NAFLD and NASH outdated. It is imperative that practising gastroenterologists and hepatologists promote awareness around the updated terminology, so that patients receive an appropriate and positive diagnosis, free of the potentially stigmatising terms 'alcoholic' and 'fatty'. This includes patients who have cofactor disease, like those with MASLD who consume excess alcohol now being categorised as having MetALD (where ALD stands for alcohol-related liver disease). Such distinctions are important, as disease trajectory and treatment approaches may vary.

There have also been concerted efforts within the SLD community to devise a global research and action framework to enact agreed agendas of change, with a specific focus on deliverable research and action priorities. This was developed as part of 'Healthy Livers, Healthy Lives', a collaboration of major liver associations (the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), Latin American Association for the Study of the Liver (ALEH), Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)) that seeks to unify efforts within the field.

### Insights into clinical trials for drugs targeting MASLD: progress, challenges, and future directions [^1122QrrG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The transition in terminology from fatty liver disease to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) marks a considerable evolution in diagnostic standards. This new definition focuses on liver fat accumulation in the context of overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction, without requiring the exclusion of other concurrent liver diseases. The new definition also provides clear guidelines for defining alcohol consumption in relation to the disease. MASLD is currently acknowledged as the most widespread liver disorder globally, affecting ~25% of the population. Despite the extensive array of clinical trials conducted in recent years, the number of approved treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease is very limited. In the review critically evaluates the results of clinical trials of related drugs and assesses the future directions for drug development trials. The renaming of MASLD presents new challenges and opportunities for the design of clinical trials and the selection of target populations for drug development.

### From the origin of NASH to the future of metabolic fatty liver disease [^111CgUXF]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Understanding the pathological and molecular hallmarks from its first description to definitions of disease entities, classifications and molecular phenotypes is crucial for both appropriate clinical management and research in this complex disease. We provide an overview through almost two hundred years of clinical research from the beginnings as a nebulous disease entity of unknown origin in the 19th century to the most frequent and vigorously investigated liver disease today. The clinical discrimination between alcohol-related liver disease and NAFLD was uncommon until the 1950s and likely contributed to the late acceptance of NAFLD as a metabolic disease entity for long time. Although the term 'fatty liver hepatitis' first appeared in 1962, it was in 1980 that the term 'non-alcoholic steatohepatitis' (NASH) was coined and the histopathological hallmarks that are still valid today were defined. The 2005 NASH Clinical Research Network scoring was the first globally accepted grading and staging system for the full spectrum of NAFLD and is still used to semiquantify main histological features. In 2021, liver biopsy remains the only diagnostic procedure that can reliably assess the presence of NASH and early fibrosis but increasing efforts are made towards non-invasive testing and molecular classification of NAFLD subtypes.

### Therapeutic targets in alcohol-associated liver disease: progress and challenges [^113TyeD4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex disease with rapidly increasing prevalence. Although there are promising therapeutic targets on the horizon, none of the newer targets is currently close to an Food and Drug Administration approval. Strategies are needed to overcome challenges in study designs and conducting clinical trials and provide impetus to the field of drug development in the landscape of ALD and alcoholic hepatitis. Management of ALD is complex and should include therapies to achieve and maintain alcohol abstinence, preferably delivered by a multidisciplinary team. Although associated with clear mortality benefit in select patients, the use of early liver transplantation still requires refinement to create uniformity in selection protocols across transplant centers. There is also a need for reliable noninvasive biomarkers for prognostication. Last but not the least, strategies are urgently needed to implement integrated multidisciplinary care models for treating the dual pathology of alcohol use disorder and of liver disease for improving the long-term outcomes of patients with ALD.

### Metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-related liver disease (metALD): position statement by an expert panel on alcohol-related liver disease [^114cvZ3A]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this position statement, we explore the intricate relationship between alcohol intake and metabolic dysfunction in the context of the 2023 nomenclature update for steatotic liver disease (SLD). Recent and lifetime alcohol use should be accurately assessed in all patients with SLD to facilitate classification of alcohol use in grams of alcohol per week. Alcohol biomarkers (i.e., phosphatidylethanol), use of validated questionnaires (i.e. AUDIT-C [alcohol use disorders identification test consumption]), and collateral information from friends and relatives could help facilitate differentiation between alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) per se and liver disease with both metabolic and alcohol-related components (MetALD). Heavy alcohol use can contribute to cardiometabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperglycaemia. As a result, caution should be exercised in the application of only one metabolic dysfunction criterion to diagnose MASLD, as suggested in the 2023 nomenclature document, particularly in individuals exceeding weekly alcohol use thresholds of 140 g for women and 210 g for men. This is particularly important in those individuals with isolated high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridaemia, or hyperglycaemia, where the disease process may be driven by alcohol itself. Additionally, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol use should be reassessed over time, especially after periods of change in risk factor exposure. This approach could ensure a more accurate prognosis and effective management of SLD, addressing both metabolic and alcohol-related factors.

### Defining paediatric metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement [^112MHiiz]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

The term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its definition, have limitations for both adults and children. The definition is most problematic for children, for whom alcohol consumption is usually not a concern. This problematic definition has prompted a consensus to rename and redefine adult NAFLD associated with metabolic dysregulation to metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Similarities, distinctions, and differences exist in the causes, natural history, and prognosis of fatty liver diseases in children compared with adults. In this Viewpoint we, an international panel, propose an overarching framework for paediatric fatty liver diseases and an age-appropriate MAFLD definition based on sex and age percentiles. The framework recognises the possibility of other coexisting systemic fatty liver diseases in children. The new MAFLD diagnostic criteria provide paediatricians with a conceptual scaffold for disease diagnosis, risk stratification, and improved clinical and multidisciplinary care, and they align with a definition that is valid across the lifespan.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117LTqtE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced liver disease in Europe and is the leading cause of death among adults with excessive alcohol consumption. There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of ALD. The relative risk of cirrhosis increases in subjects who consume more than 25 g/day. The burden of alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is high and is entirely preventable. Health agencies should develop population-based policies to reduce the prevalence of harmful and/or hazardous alcohol consumption and foster research in this field to provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Disease progression of patients with ALD is heavily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis have opened new perspectives in the early detection of advanced ALD in asymptomatic patients. Alcoholic hepatitis, the most severe form of ALD, carries a high short-term mortality (around 30–50% at 3 months). Corticosteroids improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis but duration of therapy should be adapted to early response. Liver transplantation is the best option for patients with severe liver dysfunction. However, alcohol relapse after transplantation remains a critical issue and drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened.

### Preventive strategies in chronic liver disease: part I. alcohol… [^115U8PEo]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

2 From 75 to 80 percent of persons with hepatitis C virus infection develop chronic hepatitis, and more than 25 percent develop cirrhosis within 30 to 40 years. 2 Hepatitis C virus infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the reason for 30 to 35 percent of liver transplantations. 3–5 Thus far, treatments for hepatitis C virus infection have been somewhat disappointing, with the best response rates to interferon and ribavirin therapy reported at 40 percent.
6. 7 Other recognized categories of chronic liver disease include conditions induced by toxins or drugs and autoimmune chronic liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. Chronic liver disease also includes hereditary diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and a group of liver diseases with no identifiable cause. Chronic liver disease cannot be cured. Hence, it is imperative to prevent further exacerbation of the disease and to optimize the length of time between hepatitis and the development of cirrhosis. This article reviews preventive measures that have been shown to be effective or to have a scientific rationale in the management of chronic liver disease. Preventive Strategies ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL Alcohol consumption has been associated with alcoholic hepatitis, fatty infiltration of the liver, accelerated progression of liver disease, a higher frequency of cirrhosis, a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The daily consumption of more than four drinks of alcohol increases the risk of cirrhosis, as well as death from other causes.

10, 11 Alcohol abuse and hepatitis C virus infection frequently coexist in patients with chronic liver disease. It is widely believed that alcohol and the hepatitis C virus act together to promote the development and progression of liver damage. Investigators in one study. 12 found that the effect of alcohol in patients with hepatitis C virus infection is not merely additive but synergistic, and that even moderate use of alcohol can hasten the development of cirrhosis. The mechanism for the synergistic effect of alcohol and hepatitis C virus is not fully understood, but it has been attributed to the effects of alcohol on viral replication and the immune system, hepatic iron content and hepatic regeneration. Other investigators 13 have found that alcohol abuse in patients with hepatitis C virus infection is associated with a decreased response to interferon therapy. Abstinence may reverse some of the deleterious effects of alcohol in patients with chronic liver disease.

It may also improve the ultimate response to treatment. What constitutes a safe level of alcohol consumption in patients with chronic liver disease remains unclear. It is recommended that patients with hepatitis C virus infection or other chronic liver disease consume no alcohol. Abstinence is the most important measure in keeping chronic liver disease from progressing to cirrhosis. VACCINATIONS Superinfection with hepatitis viruses in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are associated with more virulent acute infections than hepatitis C. In some patients with chronic liver disease, superinfection with hepatitis A or B virus can lead to acute liver failure. 18 followed 163 patients with hepatitis B and 432 patients with hepatitis C virus infections. In this study, hepatitis A superinfection was associated with a substantially higher risk of fulminant hepatic failure.

### MAFLD: what 2 years of the redefinition of fatty liver disease has taught us [^11763dWi]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The introduction of the new definition of MAFLD has probably been the most disagreement causing issue in the field of hepatology in the past years. It has, however, raised an intensive dialogue between specialists between all medical fields involved in the management of patients with fatty liver disease, and therefore reflects an opportunity to advance the field. As discussed in this article, we have increasingly seen original research articles in the past 2 years supporting the new definition, but we have also seen strong arguments for a need of adaptation of the new definition especially when thinking of HCC and how to deal with overlap of alcohol and metabolically induced fatty liver disease. We need universal acceptance of this definition including opinions from diabetologists/endocrinologists. Whatever name will be chosen in the future for this disease, the challenge of alcohol consumption remains. As nicely shown by Staufer et al. even when using the MAFLD definition, 25% of affected patients consume too much alcohol that very likely affects disease phenotype. Alcohol consumption will always affect presentation of fatty liver disease and all other liver diseases.

### The importance of patient engagement in the multimodal treatment of MASLD [^111e1iME]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Engagement by information

Importance of being aware of changing terminology

Three different acronyms have been used in recent years to describe in essence the same disease entity: NAFLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and MASLD. This has not only led to confusion in the scientific literature, but also heterogeneity in information sources available to the public. A key element to maintaining credibility in the patient-physician relationship when communicating with patients is consistency in what is being told to them. Since June 2023, professional societies including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the Latin American Association for the Study of the Liver (ALEH) have undertaken a consensus process among stakeholders and advised that MASLD will be the term to be used in future healthcare activities. This change in terminology should be explained to people with MASLD. For example, newly diagnosed patients with MASLD are likely to encounter patient documentation in which the NAFLD (or MAFLD) nomenclature is used. Vice versa, patients who have previously received a diagnosis of 'NAFLD' should be educated on the new MASLD terminology so they can find up to date information about their disease.

The change in MASLD nomenclature constitutes an opportunity for physicians to motivate and inform their patients. In this nomenclature, the potentially stigmatizing terms 'fatty' and 'alcoholic' were removed, and the role of metabolic dysregulation was highlighted. Further, it is in line with the preferred communication by the subset of patients with MASLD and obesity, who opt for terms such as 'weight' rather than 'fat' or 'obese'.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^112E3aBE]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The principal limitations of the terms NAFLD and NASH are the reliance on exclusionary confounder terms and the use of potentially stigmatising language. This study set out to determine if content experts and patient advocates were in favour of a change in nomenclature and/or definition. A modified Delphi process was led by three large pan-national liver associations. The consensus was defined a priori as a supermajority (67%) vote. An independent committee of experts external to the nomenclature process made the final recommendation on the acronym and its diagnostic criteria. A total of 236 panellists from 56 countries participated in 4 online surveys and 2 hybrid meetings. Response rates across the 4 survey rounds were 87%, 83%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt that the current nomenclature was sufficiently flawed to consider a name change. The terms "nonalcoholic" and "fatty" were felt to be stigmatising by 61% and 66% of respondents, respectively. Steatotic liver disease was chosen as an overarching term to encompass the various aetiologies of steatosis. The term steatohepatitis was felt to be an important pathophysiological concept that should be retained. The name chosen to replace NAFLD was metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). There was consensus to change the definition to include the presence of at least 1 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors. Those with no metabolic parameters and no known cause were deemed to have cryptogenic steatotic liver disease. A new category, outside pure metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, termed metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease (MetALD), was selected to describe those with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, who consume greater amounts of alcohol per week (140–350 g/wk and 210–420 g/wk for females and males, respectively). The new nomenclature and diagnostic criteria are widely supported and non-stigmatising, and can improve awareness and patient identification.

Desire for a name change and the role of stigma

During round 1, a supermajority of respondents (74%) felt that the current names NAFLD and NASH were sufficiently flawed to consider a name change (Supplemental Table S1,) The terms "nonalcoholic" and "fatty" were deemed to be stigmatising by 61% and 66% of respondents, respectively. A nomenclature that describes the underlying cause of the disease was preferred by 89% of respondents. While there were concerns over the precise meaning of "metabolic" and to what extent this term was understood by clinicians, a supermajority felt that having "metabolic disease or dysfunction" in the name would help patients better understand their disease (72%) and help health care professionals better explain or understand the disease (80%). Only a simple majority (56%) felt the terminology of "metabolic dysregulation" to be a clearly defined clinical entity although a supermajority (86%) felt that it highlighted a central aspect of disease pathophysiology.

### MAFLD: a consensus-driven proposed nomenclature for metabolic associated fatty liver disease [^116DcxSn]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatty liver associated with metabolic dysfunction is common, affects a quarter of the population, and has no approved drug therapy. Although pharmacotherapies are in development, response rates appear modest. The heterogeneous pathogenesis of metabolic fatty liver diseases and inaccuracies in terminology and definitions necessitate a reappraisal of nomenclature to inform clinical trial design and drug development. A group of experts sought to integrate current understanding of patient heterogeneity captured under the acronym nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and provide suggestions on terminology that more accurately reflects pathogenesis and can help in patient stratification for management. Experts reached consensus that NAFLD does not reflect current knowledge, and metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease "MAFLD" was suggested as a more appropriate overarching term. This opens the door for efforts from the research community to update the nomenclature and subphenotype the disease to accelerate the translational path to new treatments.

Alcohol consumption and NAFLD definition — NAFLD indicates the lack of any evidence of ongoing or recent consumption of significant quantities of alcohol. Published definitions of significant alcohol intake vary from > 1 alcoholic drink (~ 10 grams of alcohol per one drink unit) per day to > 40 grams per day, and if self-reported intake is not consistent with clinical suspicion, confirmation with a family member or a close friend should be considered. For clinical practice, ongoing or recent alcohol consumption ≥ 21 drinks on average per week in men and ≥ 14 drinks on average per week in women is stated as a reasonable definition for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating suspected NAFLD, with rating (Strength – 2, Quality - C).

### National prevalence estimates for steatotic liver disease and subclassifications using consensus nomenclature [^115av686]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The multisociety consensus nomenclature has renamed NAFLD to steatotic liver disease (SLD) with various subclassifications. There is a paucity of data regarding how the new nomenclature modifies our understanding of disease prevalence and patient phenotypes.

Approach and Results

Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from January 2017 to March 2020, we included all participants aged 18 years or above with complete vibration-controlled transient elastography measures. SLD and its subclassifications [metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD), MASLD + increased alcohol intake (MetALD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), etiology-specific/cryptogenic] were defined according to consensus nomenclature. National SLD prevalence and subclassifications were estimated, and among key subgroups [age, sex, race/ethnicity, advanced liver fibrosis (liver stiffness measurement [LSM] ≥ 11.7 kPa)]. Among 7367 participants, 2549 had SLD (mean age 51 y, 57.7% male, 63.2% non-Hispanic White). The estimated prevalence of SLD was 34.2% (95% CI 31.9%-36.5%): MASLD 31.3% (29.2%-33.4%), MetALD 2% (1.6%-2.9%), ALD 0.7% (0.5–0.9%), etiology-specific/cryptogenic 0.03% (0.01%-0.08%). In exploratory analyses, participants classified as non-SLD with (vs. without) advanced fibrosis had a higher mean number of metabolic risk factors [2.7 (2.3–3.1) vs. 2.0 (1.9–2.0)] and a higher proportion with average alcohol use ≥ 20 g/d (women)/ ≥ 30 g/d (men) [20.9% (6.2%-51.3%) vs. 7.2% (6.1%-8.4%)]. In another exploratory analysis, increasing quantities of alcohol use remaining below the threshold for MASLD + increased alcohol intake were associated with advanced liver fibrosis in men, but not women. There was 99% overlap in cases of NAFLD and MASLD.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight the utility of the new consensus nomenclature to address deficiencies present with the old nomenclature, and identify areas that require research to further refine classifications of SLD.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), which includes a range of disorders of different severity and is one of the most prevalent types of liver disease worldwide, has recently regained increased attention. Among other reasons, the realisation that any alcohol intake, regardless of type of beverage represents a health risk, and the new therapeutic strategies tested in recently published or undergoing clinical trials spur scientific interest in this area. In April 2019, Gut convened a round table panel of experts during the European Association for the Study of the Liver International Liver Congress in Vienna to discuss critical and up-to-date issues and clinical trial data regarding ALD, its epidemiology, diagnosis, management, pathomechanisms, possible future treatments and prevention.

### Combined effects of alcohol and metabolic disorders in patients with chronic liver disease [^114GUKeS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the major causes for nonviral liver cirrhosis in the population. Whereas the typical NAFLD patient is one with abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and no or minimal alcohol use, the patient with pure alcoholic liver cirrhosis has, according to cohort studies, typically consumed > 5–10 daily alcohol drinks for several years. 1 However, both alcohol use and components of the MetS are continuous variables and, as such, not dichotomic. Recent evidence suggests harmful synergistic effects of obesity, MetS, and alcohol intake for the risk of future liver disease. 2 Consequently, given an increasing population prevalence of overweight and obese alcohol users, expectedly, there will be many patients that do not fit either the typical NAFLD or typical ALD phenotype, but share features of both disease entities. Current case-finding strategies focusing on either pure NAFLD or pure ALD 3,4 may underestimate the true risk in individuals who will develop liver disease as the result of interaction between alcohol and metabolic disorders. 1.

Perceived impact of name and/or definition change on disease awareness, development of biomarkers, or clinical trials

When considering the potential impact of a change in name, definition, or both, 56% felt that a change in nomenclature would positively impact disease awareness. In assessing the impact of a change in name only on the interpretation of existing and emerging clinical trial results, 18%, 72%, and 11% (Supplemental Table S1; R3, Statement 27) felt that it would hinder, have no impact, and enhance, respectively. When a similar question was asked about the impact on regulatory approval of biomarkers if the name but not the definition changes, 12%, 63%, and 25% felt that it would accelerate, have no impact, or delay approval, respectively. In the event of both a name and definition change, 60% of respondents were concerned that this could hinder the interpretation of existing and emerging clinical trial results that used the currently accepted definition of NAFLD, whereas 20% felt that it would enhance, and 20% thought that there would be no impact. A simple majority (59%) felt that a change in disease definition would likely delay regulatory approval of biomarkers (R3–S24), whereas 63% felt that a change in name only would have no effect. Of note, these questions did not discuss the proposed change to the definition.

Paediatric perspective

There was a high degree of consensus among the Paediatric panelists when considering statements/questions pertaining to the Paediatric population. Only paediatricians answered the paediatric-specific questions, and the main themes addressed the role of stigma, the use of the term "metabolic", and the histological definition of the disease. In children and adolescents, 60% felt that the use of the term "nonalcoholic" was stigmatising for parents and/or Paediatric patients, with 55% finding this to be the case with the term "fatty". When asked if the current definition of NASH is less useful in children and adolescents due to a lower frequency of hepatocyte ballooning, 95% agreed that a reassessment of the definitions of steatohepatitis in the paediatric setting would be beneficial. In considering the incorporation of the term "metabolic" into the nomenclature, 90% estimated that this term may be confusing in the paediatric context since inborn errors of metabolism are referred to as "metabolic liver disease".

Abstract

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of advanced hepatic disease and frequent indication for liver transplantation worldwide. With harmful alcohol use as the primary risk factor, increasing alcohol use over the past decade has resulted in rapid growth of the ALD-related healthcare burden. The spectrum of ALD ranges from early asymptomatic liver injury to advanced disease with decompensation and portal hypertension. Compared with those with other etiologies of liver disease, patients with ALD progress faster and more often present at an advanced stage. A unique phenotype of advanced disease is alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) presenting with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and acute on chronic liver failure in severe forms conveying a 1-month mortality risk of 20%-50%. The model for end stage disease score is the most accurate score to stratify AH severity (> 20 defined as severe disease). Corticosteroids are currently the only available therapeutic with proven efficacy for patients with severe AH, providing survival benefit at 1 month in 50%-60% of patients. Abstinence of alcohol use, a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes, is challenging to achieve in ALD patients with concurrent alcohol use disorder (AUD). As patients with ALD are rarely treated for AUD, strategies are needed to overcome barriers to AUD treatment in patients with ALD and to promote a multidisciplinary integrated care model with hepatology, addiction medicine providers, and social workers to comprehensively manage the dual pathologies of liver disease and of AUD. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced cirrhosis, should be considered in selected patients with AH, who are unresponsive to medical therapy and have a low risk of relapse to posttransplant alcohol use. Level of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. This guideline was developed under the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee.

### Examining the interim proposal for name change to steatotic liver disease in the US population [^111aKNmF]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Fatty liver is the commonest liver condition globally and traditionally associated with NAFLD. A consensus meeting was held in Chicago to explore various terminologies. Herein, we explore the proposed changes in nomenclature in a population data set from the US.

Approach and Results

Statistical analysis was conducted using survey-weighted analysis. Assessment of fatty liver was conducted with vibration-controlled transient elastography. A controlled attenuation parameter of 288 dB/m was used to identify hepatic steatosis. Patients were classified into nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, and viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease. Liver stiffness measures at ≥ 8.8, ≥ 11.7, and ≥ 14 kPa were used to identify clinically significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis, respectively. A total of 5102 individuals were included in the analysis. Using a survey-weighted analysis, a total of 25.43%, 6.95%, and 0.73% of the population were classified as nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, and viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease, respectively. A sensitivity analysis at controlled attenuation parameter of 248 dB/m and fatty liver index found similar distribution. In a comparison between nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, and viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease, there was no significant difference between the odds of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis between groups. However, viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease individuals were found to have a significantly higher odds of clinically significant fibrosis (OR: 3.76, 95% CI, 1.27–11.14, p = 0.02) compared with nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease.

Conclusions

The current analysis assessed the proposed changes based on discussions from the consensus meeting. Although the definitions are an interim analysis of discussions, steatotic liver disease respects the underlying liver etiology and reduces stigma while increasing awareness of FL among viral and alcohol-associated steatosis/steatohepatitis.

Proposed modifications to current definition

The strong epidemiological and pathogenic link between NAFLD, metabolic dysfunction, and insulin resistance informed a view in the external expert committee that the diagnosis be based on affirmative rather than exclusionary criteria, such as nonalcoholic. There was near universal agreement that the criteria be defined sufficiently broadly to identify both individuals with obesity and CMRFs in the context of regional/ethnic differences. Simple, readily available, and easily measurable parameters were also deemed necessary for this set of criteria to be broadly applied in clinical practice and in various clinical settings. Finally, the diagnostic criteria were selected to align with CMRFs believed to be associated with insulin resistance, and already well established and validated in the context of cardiovascular disease. It was agreed that patients with steatosis and any one of the cardiometabolic criteria outlined in Figure 6 would be considered to have MASLD. Of note, making a diagnosis of MASLD does not imply that other causes of SLD do not need to be considered, which is particularly relevant in children where it is imperative to exclude other causes of hepatic steatosis before applying the MASLD diagnostic criteria to ensure that dual pathology is not missed. Additionally, recognising that most patients with ALD have CMRFs, the distinction between MetALD and ALD with CMRFs, would be made on the basis of quantity of alcohol intake (Figure 6).

FIGURE 6
MASLD diagnostic criteria. In the presence of hepatic steatosis, the finding of any CMRF would confer a diagnosis of MASLD if there are no other causes of hepatic steatosis. If additional drivers of steatosis are identified, then this is consistent with a combination aetiology. In the case of alcohol, this is termed MetALD or ALD, depending on extent of alcohol intake. In the absence of overt cardiometabolic criteria, other aetiologies must be excluded, and if none is identified, this is termed cryptogenic SLD although, depending on clinical judgment, it could also be deemed to be possible MASLD and, thus, would benefit from periodic reassessment on a case-by-case basis. In the setting of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, steatosis may be absent, requiring clinical judgment based on CMRFs and absence of other aetiologies. Abbreviations: ALD, alcohol-associated/related liver disease; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CMRF, cardiometabolic risk factors; DILI, drug-induced liver disease; MetALD, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated steatotic liver disease; SLD, steatotic liver disease; WC, waist circumference.

### Nomenclature and definition of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease: a consensus from the middle east and north Africa [^111bF1uf]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction is a global health problem, especially because it is one of the earliest consequences of obesity and it precedes diabetes development. Fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction is of particular concern in the Middle East and north Africa, where its prevalence is greater than that in the rest of the world. Despite the magnitude of the problem, no regional guidelines have been developed to address this disease. This Review describes suggestions of redefining fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction, including its terminology and criteria for diagnosis. Experts have raised serious concerns on the current nomenclature, which labels the disease as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its diagnostic criteria. The panel reached a consensus that the disease should be renamed as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and that the disease should be diagnosed by positive criteria. The aim is now to work with authorities across the region to implement these proposed changes and reflect them in health-care policy and to improve health care for patients in this region.

### Designing clinical trials to address alcohol use and alcohol-associated liver disease: an expert panel consensus statement [^113eHZ54]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Most patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) engage in heavy drinking defined as 4 or more drinks per day (56g) or 8 (112g) or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more drinks per day (70g) or 15 (210g) or more drinks per week for men. Although abstinence from alcohol after diagnosis of ALD improves life expectancy and reduces the risk of decompensation of liver disease, few studies have evaluated whether treatment of alcohol use disorders will reduce progression of liver disease and improve liver-related outcomes. In November 2021, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism commissioned a task force that included hepatologists, addiction medicine specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists and members of regulatory agencies to develop recommendations for the design and conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the effect of alcohol use, particularly treatment to reduce or eliminate alcohol use in patients with ALD. The task force conducted extensive reviews of relevant literature on alcohol use disorders and ALD. Findings were presented at one in-person meeting and discussed over the next 16 months to develop the final recommendations. As few clinical trials directly address this topic, the 28 recommendations approved by all members of the task force represent a consensus of expert opinions.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^114vT1ot]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scores — this table aligns histologic definitions across commonly used systems, depicting progression from early portal changes to cirrhosis. Examples include portal tract changes such as "Enlarged, fibrotic portal tracts", intermediate or advanced architectural distortion described as "Fibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosis", and the terminal category "Probable or definite cirrhosis". One multistep system specifies gradations from "1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa" to "5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)" and "6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)". Another framework characterizes earlier fibrosis as "Stellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formation" with "Numerous septa without cirrhosis" preceding cirrhosis. The alcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score) includes an early category of "No fibrosis or portal fibrosis", and other systems used in fatty liver disease describe "Perisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosis".

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^1123Yzx5]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The proposed nomenclature also improves on the prior "nonalcoholic" label and appropriately assigns a metabolic basis for this liver disease, which was long recognised as "the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome". This important conceptual change has several practical consequences. First, when addressing patients, it allows for a coherent and straightforward explanation of the disease as it is intuitively easier to understand in the context of its underlying cardiometabolic abnormalities linked to insulin resistance and its association with the patient's other conditions, rather than in the framework of a diagnosis of exclusion. This also helps to communicate to the patient the main therapeutic actions to be taken both from a liver and a holistic perspective. Second, we believe that using this classification will enhance disease awareness since the alignment of the diagnostic criteria for MASLD with widely recognised phenotypic traits in diabetes and cardiovascular medicine will make it easier for the larger community of health care providers to identify individuals with this condition. There is a strong convergence between the metabolic set of criteria that we propose for diagnosing MASLD and those proposed by Eslam et alfor MAFLD. However, the current consensus approach decided to prioritise robust and easily accessible clinical criteria and biological measurements, and as such, these criteria do not include direct measurements of insulin resistance (such as fasting insulin or Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)) because of their complexity, cost, and variability between laboratories. However, in patients with hepatic steatosis in the absence of overt CMRFs, secondary testing for insulin resistance may be useful to identify those with possible MASLD. It is important to understand that the set of diagnostic criteria for MASLD is not intended to diagnose "metabolic syndrome" or predict the occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes. The CMRFs are intended to identify patients likely to have insulin resistance as the main cause of hepatic steatosis. There was consideration of providing differential weighting for the CMRFs, such as type 2 diabetes, although the literature is conflicting in that regard with some indicating that no parameter is better than another at identifying hepatic steatosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD encompasses fatty liver disease in individuals without significant alcohol consumption, ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) is hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury (ballooning) or fibrosis, with minimal risk of progression. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis, and can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and rarely liver cancer. NASH cirrhosis is cirrhosis with current or previous histological evidence of steatosis or steatohepatitis, while cryptogenic cirrhosis is cirrhosis with no obvious etiology and is enriched with metabolic risk factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. The NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) is an unweighted composite of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning scores used to measure histologic change in NAFLD clinical trials.

### Treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current views and perspectives [^113MKrFU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. Problems still exist concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in clinical practice, for example: (a) how to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its type; (b) how to select patients candidate to treatment; (c) how to treat selected patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but only non-alcoholic steatohepatitis evolves into cirrhosis and the absolute risk of mortality for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is low. As yet, no tools, other than liver biopsy, are available to differentiate the various types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many drugs are, currently, under study to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even if well-performed trials are until necessary to define the best treatment. At the moment, the entity of the problem and the characteristics of patients frequently put the physician, in clinical practice, to choose the therapeutic approach arbitrarily which is considered more effective for each individual patient. Probably the future will consider the possibility of treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with more than one drug, by considering the various aspects and degree of this syndrome. Actually each physician should select the individual treatment on the basis of his/her knowledge and experience, by never forgetting the old saying 'primum non nocere'. However, the epidemiological entity of the problem, the characteristics of the patients, generally young, the frequent lack of clinical evidence of involvement of the liver, are all the factors that require vast well-performed clinical trials in order to define the best therapeutic approach for each individual patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver disease… [^115yLHnB]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Alcohol-associated liver disease results in cirrhosis in approximately 10% to 20% of patients. In 2017, more than 2 million people had alcohol-associated cirrhosis in the US. Alcohol-associated liver disease is the primary cause of liver-related mortality and the leading indication for liver transplant, representing 40% to 50% of all liver transplant in high-income countries. Observations Steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis are the 3 pathologic findings that are associated with progression to cirrhosis, with highest risk in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The amount and duration of alcohol consumption, female sex, obesity, and specific genetic polymorphisms such as patatin-like phospholipase domain protein 3, membrane bound O-acyltransferase, and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 genes are risk factors for alcohol-associated liver disease progression.

Ten-year survival of patients with alcohol-associated liver disease is 88% among those who are abstinent and 73% for those who relapse to alcohol consumption. Symptomatic alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by rapid onset of jaundice and a 30% risk of mortality 1 year after diagnosis. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined as a modified discriminant function score greater than or equal to 32 or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 20, is associated with the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure and multiorgan failure. Corticosteroid therapy is associated with improved 1-month survival from 65% in untreated patients to 80% in treated patients. Early liver transplant may be appropriate in highly select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to medical therapy.

In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant should be considered if the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score remains greater than 17 after 3 months of alcohol abstinence. Between 2014 and 2019, the proportion of patients waiting for liver transplantation who had alcohol-associated liver disease increased from 22% to 40%. Alcohol-associated cirrhosis accounted for approximately 27% of 1. 32 million deaths worldwide related to cirrhosis in
2017. Conclusions and Relevance. Alcohol-associated liver disease is among the most common liver diseases and more than 2 million people in the US in 2017 had alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Corticosteroid therapy improves survival in select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Liver transplantation is the most effective therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnostic criteria and severity — Diagnosis is based on past-year symptoms, where the presence of at least 2 symptoms indicates an AUD and severity is graded by symptom count: Mild: 2–3 symptoms; Moderate: 4–5 symptoms; Severe: 6 or more symptoms. Criteria include statements such as "Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended", "There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use", "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol", and physiologic features including "Tolerance, as defined by either of the following" with "Need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol", and "Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following" with "The characteristic alcohol withdrawal syndrome; or Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms".

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and implications for cardiovascular risk and disease prevention [^112RTgFu]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

The newly proposed term "metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease" (MAFLD) is replacing the old term "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease" (NAFLD) in many global regions, because it better reflects the pathophysiology and cardiometabolic implications of this common liver disease. The proposed change in terminology from NAFLD to MAFLD is not simply a single-letter change in an acronym, since MAFLD is defined by a set of specific and positive diagnostic criteria. In particular, the MAFLD definition specifically incorporates within the classification recognized cardiovascular risk factors. Although convincing evidence supports a significant association between both NAFLD and MAFLD, with increased risk of CVD morbidity and mortality, neither NAFLD nor MAFLD have received sufficient attention from the Cardiology community. In fact, there is a paucity of scientific guidelines focusing on this common and burdensome liver disease from cardiovascular professional societies. This Perspective article discusses the rationale and clinical relevance for Cardiologists of the newly proposed MAFLD definition.

### Natural history of histologically proven alcohol-related liver disease: a systematic review [^111MzbXG]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To date, studies into the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) have lacked long-term follow-up, large numbers of participants, or both. We performed a systematic review to summarise studies that describe the natural history of histologically proven ALD.

Methods

PubMed and Medline were searched for relevant studies according to pre-specified criteria. Data were extracted to describe the prevalence of ALD, histological progression of disease and mortality. Single-proportion meta-analysis was used to combine data from studies regarding rates of progression or mortality.

Results

Thirty-seven studies were included, reporting data from 7,528 participants. Amongst cohorts of hazardous drinkers, on average 15% had normal histological appearance, 27% had hepatic steatosis, 24% had steatohepatitis and 26% had cirrhosis. The annualised rates of progression of pre-cirrhotic disease to cirrhosis were 1% (0–8%) for patients with normal histology, 3% (2–4%) for hepatic steatosis, 10% (6–17%) for steatohepatitis and 8% (3–19%) for fibrosis. Annualised mortality was 6% (4–7%) in patients with steatosis and 8% (5–13%) in cirrhosis. In patients with steatohepatitis on biopsy a marked difference was seen between inpatient cohorts (annual mortality 15%, 8–26%) and mixed cohorts of inpatients and outpatients (annual mortality 5%, 2–10%). Only in steatosis did non-liver-related mortality exceed liver-specific causes of mortality (5% per year vs. 1% per year).

Conclusions

These data confirm the observation that alcohol-related hepatic steatohepatitis requiring admission to hospital is the most dangerous subtype of ALD. Alcohol-related steatosis is not a benign condition as it is associated with significant risk of mortality.

Lay Summary

Knowledge of the natural history of a disease allows clinicians and patients to understand the risks that are associated with a medical condition. In this study we systematically gathered all the published data regarding the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease in people who had a liver biopsy. We used this data to define the prevalence of the disease, the annual risk of progression to cirrhosis and the annual risk of death at each stage of the disease.

### Steatotic liver disease [^112ykdd1]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Steatotic liver disease is the overarching term for conditions characterised by abnormal lipid accumulation in the liver (liver or hepatic steatosis). Steatotic liver disease encompasses what was previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is now called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Additionally, steatotic liver disease includes alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and MetALD, the new classification for the overlap between MASLD and ALD, and rare causes of liver steatosis. Cirrhosis is globally the 11th leading cause of death, and steatotic liver disease has become the leading cause of cirrhosis in the EU and USA. Steatotic liver disease affects around 30% of the global population and is mainly driven by obesity, type 2 diabetes, and alcohol intake, but only a minor proportion with steatotic liver disease progress to cirrhosis. The presence and progression of liver fibrosis led by hepatic inflammation is the main predictor of liver-related death across the entire spectrum of steatotic liver diseases. A combination of recent advancements of widely available biomarkers for early detection of liver fibrosis together with considerable advancements in therapeutic interventions offer the possibility to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with steatotic liver disease. This Seminar covers the recent reclassification of steatotic liver disease and how it reflects clinical practice and prognosis. For early detection of liver fibrosis, we propose a collaborative diagnostic framework between primary care and liver specialists. Lastly, we discuss current best practices for managing steatotic liver disease, we explore therapeutic targets across the spectrum of steatotic liver diseases, and we review the pipeline of drugs in development for MASLD.

### Prevalence of steatotic liver disease (MASLD, metALD, and ALD) in the United States: NHANES 2017–2020 [^116dD4zw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the Delphi consensus process, the term steatotic liver disease (SLD) was introduced to replace fatty liver disease, while the term metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) emerged as the successor to the term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 1 This revised nomenclature aims to enhance precision and mitigate negative connotations and potential stigmatization, while refining comprehension and disease categorization. Concurrently, a novel category was introduced to capture individuals whose alcohol consumption exceeded the previously defined thresholds of NAFLD but remained unclassified within the existing system. This category, termed MetALD, now delineates a spectrum of conditions and is defined as a daily intake of 20 to 50 g of alcohol (or weekly 140–350 g) for females and 30 to 60 g daily for males (or weekly 210–420 g). 1 Within the MetALD spectrum, some individuals might predominantly exhibit MASLD characteristics, whereas others might be more inclined toward alcoholic liver disease (ALD). 1 In the present study, we used a US nationally representative data set to calculate the prevalence of SLD and its subcategories in the United States.

Proposed new nomenclature for NAFLD, NASH, and NAFLD with increased alcohol consumption

When considering different subcategories under the overarching term of SLD, 67% of respondents preferred the NAFLD replacement term to include the word "metabolic". The top 3 acronyms, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MetSLD or metabolic steatotic liver disease (MSLD), were 30%, 30%, and 22%, respectively (Figure 4). In total, 75% of respondents of the external expert committee chose MASLD as the replacement term for NAFLD and 88% metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) as the replacement term for NASH. The acronym MetALD was chosen by 28% and metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease (MAASLD) by 33% to represent a separate group of patients with MASLD that consumes 140–350 g/wk for females and 210–420 g/wk for males. MetALD was chosen to avoid the possible confusion or perception associated with the acronym AASLD within MAASLD that may link the acronym to a specific professional association. Within MetALD, there is a continuum where, conceptually, the condition can be seen to be MASLD or ALD predominant. This may vary over time within a given individual.

### Crosstalk between alcohol use disorder and obesity: two sides of the same coin? [^115ABTUs]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that AUD and obesity are common and frequently co-exist, the related medical consequences often arise from their additive or synergistic effects. For example, hypertension and cardiomyopathy are common in people with obesity and/or AUD; weight loss as well alcohol abstinence or even reduction are associated with improvement in cardiovascular comorbidities. Importantly, patients with both AUD and obesity are even more likely to have comorbid cardiovascular complications due to the dual etiology.

Hepatic diseases offer another cogent example of the dual etiology of AUD and obesity in organ-related damage and consequences. People with alcohol-associated cirrhosis have a much lower life expectancy than the general population (on average 14 years shorter for men and 16 years shorter for women). Not only is alcohol a main cause of chronic liver disease and acute liver failure, but also with the development of new effective treatments for hepatitis C, alcohol has now become the leading cause of cirrhosis and the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Like alcohol use, obesity in the United States has also increased, leading to an increase in the previously named non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several studies have shown accelerated liver disease in people with metabolic syndrome (central adiposity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) who also drink alcohol. For example, a study from Northern Europe showed a ~ 7‐fold increase in incidence of severe liver disease in people with greater central adiposity who also consumed > 1 and > 2 alcohol-containing drinks/day for women and men, respectively; such increase approached 20-fold in people with diabetes versus those without. In other words, not only are AUD and obesity two leading causes of liver diseases, but also their frequent comorbidity contributes to accelerated development and worsening of liver disease. The increased knowledge of overlapping biological processes that contribute to both NAFLD and alcohol-associated/related liver disease (ALD), coupled with the increased clinical and public relevance of this dual etiology, has led to a recent effort across multiple international liver societies to develop a new nomenclature. NAFLD has been replaced with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and a new category, outside of pure MASLD, was created and named MetALD to describe those with MASLD who consume excessive amounts of alcohol (140 and 210 g/week for women and men, respectively). This new nomenclature acknowledges the common clinical feature of concomitant metabolic- and alcohol-related contributions to hepatic steatosis and subsequent liver inflammation, damage, and degeneration. This interdisciplinary approach may serve as a model for studying other medical conditions due to AUD and obesity comorbidity.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112LK915]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol use thresholds and MetALD classification within MASLD nomenclature — The definition of MASLD excludes patients with consumption of > 20 g/30 g of alcohol per day in females and males, respectively; under the new nomenclature, patients with hepatic steatosis, cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF), and alcohol use at weekly intake of 140–350 g in women and 210–420 g in men or an average daily 20–50 g in women and 30–60 g in men are classified as having MetALD. Clinically, the overlay between ALD and MASLD represents a dynamic spectrum ranging from MASLD predominant at lower alcohol use (weekly intake closer to 140 g in women and 210 g in men) to ALD predominant at higher alcohol use (weekly intake of up to 350 g in women and 420 g in men); these dual-pathology patients are considered to have a dual pathology and should be studied separately, and patients with MetALD should be studied separately as they may have faster disease progression than those with MASLD.

### Past, present and future perspectives in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112ksczT]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was first described as a distinct clinical entity four decades ago. However, the condition has become the centre of attention within hepatology owing to its high prevalence and growing contribution to the burden of end-stage liver disease in the general population. This Perspective provides an overview on the development of knowledge related to NAFLD with a focus on landmark findings that have influenced current paradigms and key knowledge gaps that need to be filled to make progress. Specifically, a timeline of scientific discovery of both basic disease mechanisms (with a focus on human data) and the evolution of knowledge about the clinical course of the disease is provided and related to current approaches to treat and eventually prevent NAFLD.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^1163iLkB]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Switching from a definition based on the exclusion of any other liver disease (ie, NAFLD) to a definition based on specific, primarily CMRFs (ie, MASLD) has potential limitations. First, the key metabolic dysfunction underlying MASLD is insulin resistance, and the selected metabolic risk factors do not equally predict insulin resistance, as, for example, diastolic blood pressure and HDL-C are only weakly associated with insulin resistance. Second, insulin resistance and steatosis may be present in the absence of any CMRFs, especially in younger adults in the primary care setting. Thus, patients with steatosis without overt CMRFs or other discernible causes are labeled as cryptogenic. If there is uncertainty and the clinician strongly suspects metabolic dysfunction despite the absence of CMRF, then the term possible MASLD can be considered pending additional testing (e.g. Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and oral glucose tolerance tests) although this should be left to the discretion of the clinical team. Such cases and also cryptogenic cases that subsequently manifest CMRF can be rebadged as MASLD.

Role of alcohol in disease definitions

With respect to alcohol intake, the overwhelming consensus was to continue to limit alcohol intake (as previously limited for NAFLD) in the context of steatosis. The purpose of this process was to focus on NAFLD, not alcohol-associated/related liver disease, but it was seen as relevant to comment on situations where there was overlap. We, therefore, created a separate category outside of pure MASLD, namely, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated/related liver disease (MetALD), with alcohol intake greater than that allowed for NAFLD/MASLD. Within the group of patients with MetALD, there may be individuals where MASLD is the perceived dominant driver and others where ALD is the perceived dominant driver, and indeed, this may change over time (Figure 5).

### Two years on, a perspective on MAFLD [^113eQbVT]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thanks to the pioneering insights into scientists like Thomas Addison who in 1845 used the term 'fatty liver', Klatskin in 1979, and Jurgen Ludwig in 1980 who coined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), our knowledge about this disease has exponentially increased. This legacy of scientific discovery for improving human health has transformed the lives of thousands of patients. On this journey, we often think of disease definitions as immutable. However, in reality, diagnostic criteria organically change over time, a key outcome of an expanding knowledge base.

Metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a multisystem disorder with a heterogeneous disease course and outcomes that, for a majority, are clinically speaking, relatively silent. With its multifaceted origin, it is not surprising that no single clinical, laboratory, histological or radiographic feature can serve as a 'gold standard' for diagnosis or for classification. A natural outcome, particularly when initially described using the 'non' term, signifies that it is not another disease, in this case, alcohol-related. Because of this, the diagnosis of 'NAFLD' is still frequently delayed, sometimes for decades, with most patients diagnosed at the time of cirrhosis. This highlights the core issues of both disease awareness and diagnostic criteria. The problem is compounded in practice by serious concerns about the consequences of missing MAFLD in the context of other known liver diseases.

### Validation of the new nomenclature of steatotic liver disease in patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake: an analysis of data from a prospective cohort study [^114FTXnD]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Steatotic liver disease is a new overarching term that includes metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-related steatotic liver disease (MetALD), and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). We aimed to validate the prognostic importance of MASLD, MetALD, and ALD as steatotic liver disease subclasses.

Methods

Between April 18, 2013, and Sept 17, 2018, we prospectively recruited patients aged 18–75 years with current or previous excessive alcohol intake (> 24 g/day for women and > 36 g/day for men) for at least a year and no previous hepatic decompensation from the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Odense University Hospital (Odense, Denmark). Participants were followed up until Sept 15, 2022. Here, we characterise these patients according to steatotic liver disease subclasses. We classified patients as having MASLD, MetALD, or ALD in accordance with the nomenclature definitions, on the basis of metabolic comorbidity and self-reported average alcohol intake in the 3 months leading up to inclusion. Histological scoring was done by a pathologist who was masked to the clinical data. We compared prognoses between classes using Cox regression analyses on hepatic decompensation and overall mortality as the two outcome measures. Patients not meeting the criteria for steatotic liver disease were classified as no steatotic liver disease and served as a reference group.

Findings

We enrolled 446 patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake were included in this analysis (334 [75%] were male and 112 [25%] were female; median age 56 years [SD 10]). Cirrhosis was present in 58 (13%), and 435 (98%) had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. 321 (72%) met steatotic liver disease criteria and 125 (28%) did not have steatotic liver disease, meaning no evident liver steatosis and no significant fibrosis (≥ F2). Of the 321 patients with steatotic liver disease, six (2%) were identified as having ALD due to the absence of cardiometabolic risk factors. The remaining 315 (98%) patients presented with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Of these patients, 153 (49%) had MASLD, 76 (24%) had MetALD, and 86 (27%) had ALD. During follow-up, 67 (15%) of 446 patients decompensated and 97 (22%) died (median follow-up 70 months [IQR 53–94]). Patients with steatotic liver disease had a significantly higher risk of hepatic decompensation and overall mortality than those without steatotic liver disease, independent of age, sex, and liver stiffness. The risk of decompensation increased in a stepwise manner from MASLD (hazard ratio 4.73 [95% CI 1.03–21.6]), through MetALD (7.69 [1.66–35.6]), to ALD (10.2 [2.24–46.4]). Similarly, overall mortality increased from MASLD (HR 2.30 [95% CI 1.08–4.90]), through MetALD (2.94 [1.31–6.58]), to ALD (3.57 [1.64–7.80]), independent of age, sex, and liver stiffness.

Interpretation

Steatotic liver disease and its subclasses portend distinct prognoses. There is a need to specify how historical alcohol intake should be integrated into the nomenclature and risk stratification of steatotic liver disease.

1 Introduction

The nomenclature used to describe steatotic liver disease (SLD) has evolved considerably in recent years and now encompasses a range of conditions with different etiologies. Recently, leading scientific and professional societies, including the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), endorsed a shift from the term non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This updated terminology better reflects the critical role of metabolic dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. While this updated terminology emphasizes the metabolic drivers of disease, much of the literature still refers to NAFLD and NASH. For clarity, this article will use the terms MASLD and MASH, while continuing to refer to NAFLD and NASH when discussing previous studies.

Recent updates in nomenclature and diagnostic criteria encompass the diverse phenotypes associated with steatotic liver disease (SLD). 1 These updates aim to reflect the current understanding of SLD, promote disease awareness and research, and reduce stigma. Notably, the term metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is defined as hepatic steatosis with at least 1 of 5 cardiometabolic criteria without any other cause of steatosis. A new category, MetALD, includes those with MASLD and high alcohol intake. 1 We aimed to characterize SLD using this nomenclature in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and to quantify its association with cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Treatment of alcohol use disorders in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^114bBu3X]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is one of the leading causes of disease and disability in almost all European countries. Among the alcohol-related diseases, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most common. At present, alcohol is the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis in the Western world. The cornerstone of treatment for ALD is achieving total alcohol abstinence and preventing relapse; medical and surgical treatments for ALD are limited when drinking continues. This narrative review summarizes current treatments for AUDs with a particular emphasis to the treatment of AUDs in patients with ALD. Medical management, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions are analyzed, underlying limits and options in AUD patients. Finally, this review discusses the most appropriate setting for the management of AUD patients with advanced liver disease as well as the indications for liver transplantation in AUD patients.

### MAFLD: what 2 years of the redefinition of fatty liver disease has taught us [^113Tryyu]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has appeared as the leading liver disease worldwide. Whereas the terminology nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mainly reflected a negative selection and exclusion of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), the new definition made its focus on the association of MAFLD with overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic risk factors especially also in normal weight/lean subjects. Several studies from the past 2years have now used the new definition and have provided substantial information that this new definition might be accurate. Studies from the past 2years have provided evidence that the new definition might be especially advantageous in the characterization and identification of patients with significant fibrosis. This has also been demonstrated in the well-known Rotterdam study in which the MAFLD-only group showed a higher rate of fibrosis and liver stiffness. MAFLD might also be able to predict all-cause mortality as demonstrated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Furthermore, MAFLD might improve characterization of the cardiovascular risk of this patient population. As the term MAFLD has not yet been accepted universally, it remains important to coordinate efforts globally to adapt to this new definition and especially involve all specialities dealing with metabolic disorders such as diabetologists to further improve its definition and to prepare the medical community for its future use. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically address evidence emerging over the past 2years that usage of the term MAFLD could be helpful in daily clinical practice.

Comparative analysis of CV risk across different terminologies of fatty liver diseases

In recent years, as the understanding of fatty liver disease deepens, the diagnostic criteria for NAFLD, MAFLD, MASLD have gradually evolved, reflecting a deeper understanding of the relationship between metabolism and liver health. At the same time, a new category, outside pure MASLD, termed metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease (MetALD), was selected to describe those with MASLD who consume greater amounts of alcohol per week (140 g/week and 210 g/week for females and males respectively). The variations in these criteria not only affect the diagnosis of liver disease but also have a substantial impact on the assessment of CV risk.

The diagnostic criteria for NAFLD are based on liver imaging (such as ultrasound, CT or MRI) showing more than 5% fat deposits in the liver, and exclude alcoholic liver disease (daily alcohol intake > 20 g for men, > 10 g for women) and other causes (such as drugs, viral hepatitis, hereditary liver disease, etc.). Its criteria emphasize the presence of fat accumulation, but the lack of attention to metabolic factors may lead to insufficient CV risk assessment for certain metabolic high-risk populations (such as obese patients).
