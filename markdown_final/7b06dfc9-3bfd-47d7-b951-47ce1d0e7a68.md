## Question

metabolic alkalosis in conn's disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how metabolic alkalosis arises in Conn's disease (primary aldosteronism), including generation, maintenance, clinical features, diagnostic implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of aldosterone excess on the distal nephron. Then, I should verify the generation phase of alkalosis via hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate generation. Next, I will examine the maintenance phase, especially the role of hypokalemia and chloride handling. After that, I should review the classic and contemporary clinical phenotype, including the shift toward normokalemia. Then, I will consider diagnostic implications and screening. Finally, I will outline management principles that target both the mineralocorticoid excess and the electrolyte disturbances, and close with a concise synthesis of the mechanism.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and its renal targets. Primary aldosteronism is characterized by renin-independent aldosterone excess, classically from an aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral hyperplasia, leading to mineralocorticoid receptor activation in the distal nephron with ENaC-driven sodium reabsorption and coupled potassium and hydrogen secretion, producing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, often with hypertension and suppressed renin activity [^112gUZuL] [^1161rRLN] [^113289L8].

> I will now examine the generation phase. Aldosterone stimulates principal cells to reabsorb sodium via ENaC, creating a lumen-negative potential that drives potassium secretion through ROMK and hydrogen secretion via H+-ATPase in adjacent A-intercalated cells, generating new bicarbonate and raising serum bicarbonate and pH; this is the primary mechanism of metabolic alkalosis generation in Conn's syndrome [^11722S9x] [^111urpFv] [^1144XRk8].

> Wait, let me verify the maintenance phase, because persistence is the key clinical puzzle. Hypokalemia itself sustains alkalosis by increasing proximal HCO3− reabsorption, enhancing distal hydrogen secretion, stimulating ammoniagenesis with new bicarbonate generation, and downregulating pendrin in B-intercalated cells, thereby blunting bicarbonate secretion; chloride depletion and volume status also modulate correction, but in primary aldosteronism the mineralocorticoid excess and hypokalemia together maintain the alkalosis until both are corrected [^112nREW8] [^112ERikX] [^1153skbz].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of pendrin more carefully. Pendrin in B-intercalated cells mediates bicarbonate secretion and chloride reabsorption; aldosterone can stimulate pendrin, which would seem to oppose alkalosis, but in primary aldosteronism the dominant effect of aldosterone-driven sodium reabsorption and hypokalemia outweighs this, and hypokalemia itself suppresses pendrin, so the net effect is impaired bicarbonate excretion and maintenance of alkalosis; I initially thought aldosterone uniformly suppresses pendrin, but it can actually upregulate it, so the net balance depends on the strength of competing signals, with hypokalemia tipping toward pendrin suppression and alkalosis maintenance in PA [^113ZpS2W] [^112nREW8].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype. Historically, Conn's syndrome presented with severe hypertension, marked hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, often with muscle weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia; however, contemporary data show that many patients are normokalemic, and the triad of hypertension, hypokalemia, and alkalosis is now seen in a minority, so absence of hypokalemia does not exclude primary aldosteronism [^115pvnuz] [^113289L8] [^111J9k27].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic implications are framed correctly. The presence of unexplained hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis and hypertension, especially with suppressed renin, should prompt screening with an aldosterone-to-renin ratio; confirmatory testing and subtype evaluation follow, and importantly, potassium should be corrected before interpreting a negative screen because hypokalemia can falsely lower aldosterone and obscure the diagnosis, so repeating ARR after repletion is advised if suspicion remains high [^113rDc6q] [^1161rRLN].

> Let me consider management principles and double-check that they align with pathophysiology. Definitive therapy targets the mineralocorticoid excess: surgical adrenalectomy for unilateral disease or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone for bilateral disease or patients unsuitable for surgery; concurrently, potassium repletion is essential because correcting hypokalemia removes a key maintenance factor and improves both alkalosis and blood pressure, and sodium restriction can further mitigate aldosterone effects; these steps directly reverse the generation and maintenance drivers of alkalosis in PA [^112ERikX] [^113289L8] [^1161rRLN].

> But wait, what if the patient is critically ill with severe alkalosis; should I add acetazolamide? I should confirm the caveat here. Acetazolamide can increase bicarbonate excretion, but its benefit is limited in volume-expanded mineralocorticoid excess states and may be blunted in hypokalemia; moreover, it does not treat the underlying driver, so it is not first-line in Conn's alkalosis and should be reserved for select scenarios after addressing MR blockade and potassium repletion [^112ERikX] [^113x7FQh].

> In summary, I need to synthesize the mechanism clearly. In Conn's disease, autonomous aldosterone excess drives ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption, creating a lumen-negative potential that obligates potassium and hydrogen secretion; hydrogen secretion generates new bicarbonate and causes metabolic alkalosis, while potassium loss and secondary effects sustain the disorder by enhancing proximal and distal acidification processes and suppressing bicarbonate secretion, so correction requires both mineralocorticoid receptor blockade and potassium repletion to break the generation-maintenance cycle [^11722S9x] [^112nREW8] [^112ERikX].

---

Metabolic alkalosis in Conn's syndrome is driven by **excess aldosterone** [^112gUZuL] that increases distal sodium reabsorption via ENaC, promoting potassium and hydrogen secretion and raising serum bicarbonate [^1153skbz]. Hypokalemia further sustains alkalosis by stimulating hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption [^112nREW8]. The classic triad is **hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis** [^115pvnuz]; however, many patients are normokalemic, so alkalosis may be the key clue [^113289L8]. Diagnosis relies on an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio with confirmatory testing [^1161rRLN], and management includes mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or surgery, with potassium correction to reverse the alkalosis [^112ERikX].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Primary mechanism: aldosterone excess

- **ENaC activation**: Aldosterone increases ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, creating a negative luminal charge that drives potassium and hydrogen secretion [^1153skbz] [^11722S9x].

- **Hydrogen secretion**: Increased hydrogen secretion generates bicarbonate, raising serum bicarbonate and pH [^111urpFv].

- **Potassium loss**: Enhanced potassium secretion causes hypokalemia, which further stimulates hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption, sustaining alkalosis [^112nREW8].

---

### Secondary mechanisms: hypokalemia and volume status

Hypokalemia increases **renal hydrogen secretion** and bicarbonate reabsorption, perpetuating alkalosis [^112nREW8] [^117Emqcc]. Volume expansion from sodium retention increases **effective arterial blood volume**, which sustains aldosterone-driven hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption [^1153skbz].

---

## Clinical presentation and laboratory findings

### Classic clinical triad

- **Hypertension**: Typically resistant or severe [^113289L8].

- **Hypokalemia**: Often spontaneous or diuretic-induced [^113Y62gS].

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Elevated serum bicarbonate (> 28 mmol/L) with elevated pH [^1144XRk8].

---

### Additional laboratory findings

- **Elevated aldosterone**: Inappropriately high for sodium intake [^112gUZuL].

- **Suppressed renin**: Due to negative feedback from aldosterone excess [^112tLBDK].

- **Hypernatremia**: Mild, from sodium retention [^113Y62gS].

- **Hypomagnesemia**: Occurs in some patients [^115pvnuz].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Screening

Screening uses the **aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR)** [^113rDc6q], with an elevated ARR suggesting primary aldosteronism [^112tLBDK].

---

### Confirmatory testing

Confirmatory testing includes **saline infusion, fludrocortisone suppression, or captopril challenge** to confirm autonomous aldosterone secretion [^1161rRLN] [^112tLBDK].

---

### Subtype differentiation

Subtype differentiation uses **adrenal CT** to identify adenomas or hyperplasia, and **adrenal vein sampling** to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease [^113dgUnG] [^1161rRLN].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Medical management centers on **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists** (spironolactone or eplerenone) to block aldosterone and correct alkalosis and hypokalemia [^112ERikX]. Potassium supplementation corrects **hypokalemia** and helps reverse alkalosis [^112ERikX].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management entails **adrenalectomy** for unilateral disease (adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia), which typically normalizes potassium and improves blood pressure [^113289L8] [^117K8Mav].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure [^111J9k27].

- **Renal complications**: Chronic kidney disease and proteinuria [^112gUZuL].

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Muscle weakness, cramping, and paralysis due to hypokalemia [^113dgUnG].

---

Metabolic alkalosis in Conn's syndrome reflects **aldosterone-driven hydrogen secretion and bicarbonate generation**, sustained by hypokalemia and volume expansion [^1153skbz]. Recognition of this pattern — especially when hypokalemia is absent — should prompt ARR screening and confirmatory testing, with therapy focused on mineralocorticoid blockade or surgical cure and correction of potassium to reverse the alkalosis [^113Y62gS] [^1161rRLN] [^112ERikX].

### Metabolic alkalosis [^115h2Xfw]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

Metabolic alkalosis is a very commonly encountered acid-base disorder that may be generated by a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous, pathophysiologic mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms are also responsible for the persistence, or maintenance, of metabolic alkalosis. Understanding these generation and maintenance mechanisms helps direct appropriate intervention and correction of this disorder. The framework utilized in this review is based on the ECF volume-centered approach popularized by Donald Seldin and Floyd Rector in the 1970s. Although many subsequent scientific discoveries have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis, that framework continues to be a valuable and relatively straightforward diagnostic and therapeutic model.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^114PTywk]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary pathophysiologic event characterized by the gain of bicarbonate or the loss of nonvolatile acid from extracellular fluid. The kidney preserves normal acid-base balance by two mechanisms: bicarbonate reclamation, mainly in the proximal tubule, and bicarbonate generation, predominantly in the distal nephron. Bicarbonate reclamation is mediated mainly by a Na(+)-H(+) antiporter and to a smaller extent by the H(+)-ATPase (adenosine triphosphate-ase). The principal factors affecting HCO3(-) reabsorption include effective arterial blood volume, glomerular filtration rate, chloride, and potassium. Bicarbonate regeneration is primarily affected by distal Na(+) delivery and reabsorption, aldosterone, arterial pH, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To generate metabolic alkalosis, either a gain of base or a loss of acid must occur. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or via the kidney. Excess base may be gained by oral or parenteral HCO3(-) administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate administration. Factors that help maintain metabolic alkalosis include decreased glomerular filtration rate, volume contraction, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and aldosterone excess. Clinical states associated with metabolic alkalosis are vomiting, mineralocorticoid excess, the adrenogenital syndrome, licorice ingestion, diuretic administration, and Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. The effects of metabolic alkalosis on the body are variable and include effects on the central nervous system, myocardium, skeletal muscle, and liver. Treatment of this disorder is simple, once the pathophysiology of the cause is delineated. Therapy consists of reversing the contributory factors that are promoting the alkalosis and, in severe cases, administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acid infusion, and low bicarbonate dialysis.

Could I just ask you to talk a little about primary aldosteronism and its prevalence?

The classic view, dating back 50 years to the seminal work of Jerome Conn at that time, at the University of Michigan, is that primary aldosteronism was manifested by hypertension. This new entity called primary aldosteronism (later named Conn's syndrome), was caused by an adrenal tumor secreting excessive amounts of the adrenal hormone aldosterone, As originally defined, primary aldosteronism was associated with hypokalaemia, present in approximately 40% of patients, and usually there was a lack of oedema in this setting. The reason for that was the mechanism of aldosterone escape, which I will return to later, leading to an increase in natriuresis and diuresis. And, finally, it was believed that the excess of aldosterone resulted in metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, and mild hypernatraemia. Again, if we were sitting in an office with our patient in 1990, the tell-tale signs we would look for would be hypokalaemia and substantial hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. And we were also taught that primary aldosteronism is a rare and categorical disease.

Recently, there has been a huge paradigm shift, and our current understanding of primary aldosteronism has been completely revised. This was best summarised in a landmark publication by a group of major investigators in the field published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2020. Brown et al. showed that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is high and, importantly for all of us in clinical medicine, remains largely unrecognised. Furthermore, that severe hypertension and hypokalaemia are not prerequisites for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; rather, it can frequently be detected not only in normokalaemic hypertensive patients, but, indeed, across a very wide spectrum of blood pressure alterations.

Essentially, these observations have served to radically redefine primary aldosteronism. From a disease that, historically, was identified as a rare, infrequent cause of hypertension to what we now know it as today: a common syndrome that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

### Quadriplegia and rhabdomyolysis as a presenting feature of Conn's syndrome [^113dgUnG]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Conn's syndrome is an important endocrine cause for secondary hypertension. Hypokalaemia paralysis and rhabdomyolysis with accelerated hypertension may be the presenting symptoms of Conn's syndrome. Here, we present one such case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with accelerated hypertension and acute onset quadriplegia. On biochemical evaluation, she was found to have severe hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis and elevated creatinine phosphokinase. Further evaluation revealed an elevated aldosterone renin ratio suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism which was localised to left adrenal adenoma on contrast-enhanced CT. Patient's blood pressure and serum potassium levels normalised after resection of the adrenal adenoma.

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^114J8fm2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Conn syndrome and Crohn disease in a pediatric case: an interesting parallel [^116vXsa9]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Conn syndrome is characterized by surreptitious secretion of aldosterone in which patients are found to have hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Although rare, the most common presentation in the pediatric population is bilateral hyperplasia of the adrenal glands as opposed to an adenoma. Crohn disease is part of the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease, which manifests in children as flare-ups of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. The association of concurrent Conn syndrome and Crohn disease has been previously presented in two cases in adults. This is the first pediatric case to be reported in the literature.

Introduction

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) comprise a heterogeneous group of familial and sporadic disorders characterized by a relatively autonomous renin-independent aldosterone production syndrome. PA can be classified into subtypes, that differ in terms of clinical management, including unilateral forms, which may be treated surgically (such as aldosterone-producing adenomas), and bilateral forms (such as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia/nodules) requiring medical management. The classical description of the disorder firstly made by Conn and colleagues in 1955 (syndrome of hypertension, sodium retention, and hypokalemic alkalosis that could be cured by removal of an adrenal cortical tumour) can be found in approximately one third of subjects, whilst adenoma with normokalaemia is the most common presentation. PA is a well characterized form of secondary hypertension in adults particularly in patients with resistant hypertension. Apart from being a potentially treatable form of hypertension, PA may also be an independent cardiovascular risk factor as affected subjects display an increased cardiovascular risk (including stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes and metabolic syndrome), which is not fully explained by blood pressure level. However, uncertainty exists regarding the prevalence of the syndrome in the general hypertensive population due to screening bias and non-uniform criteria used to diagnose. In fact, it is commonly accepted that there is a continuum between low-renin primary (essential) hypertension and PA and a diagnosis is only obtained in patients who fulfil the criteria suggested for its diagnosis. Because of this, PA remains an often unrecognized condition particularly in subjects with resistant hypertension. The aim of this document is therefore to raise awareness about PA, guide clinicians in the screening/diagnosis process and support the treatment strategy to mitigate the adverse cardiometabolic effects in otherwise undiagnosed individuals.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^1144XRk8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a widespread acid-base disturbance, especially in hospitalized patients. It is characterized by the primary elevation of serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, along with a compensatory increase in P 2 consequent to adaptive hypoventilation. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis involves either a loss of fixed acid or a net accumulation of bicarbonate within the extracellular fluid. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney, whereas the sources of excess alkali may be via oral or parenteral alkali intake. Severe metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients — arterial blood pH of 7.55 or higher — is associated with significantly increased mortality rate. The kidney is equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to avert the generation or the persistence (maintenance) of metabolic alkalosis by enhancing bicarbonate excretion. These mechanisms include increased filtration as well as decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bicarbonate by specialized transporters in specific nephron segments. Factors that interfere with these mechanisms will impair the ability of the kidney to eliminate excess bicarbonate, therefore promoting the generation or impairing the correction of metabolic alkalosis. These factors include volume contraction, low glomerular filtration rate, potassium deficiency, hypochloremia, aldosterone excess, and elevated arterial carbon dioxide. Major clinical states are associated with metabolic alkalosis, including vomiting, aldosterone or cortisol excess, licorice ingestion, chloruretic diuretics, excess calcium alkali ingestion, and genetic diseases such as Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this installment in the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis; appraise the precipitating events; and discuss clinical presentations, diagnoses, and treatments of metabolic alkalosis.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^115uKjaC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

Aldosterone Excess

Volume depletion stimulates the RAAS, which mitigates sodium loss by increasing Na + absorption in exchange for K + and H + secretion. Increased H + secretion into the collecting duct lumen leads to enhanced HCO 3 − absorption through A-intercalated cells and contributes to metabolic alkalosis (Fig 4B). The stimulation of K + secretion into the collecting duct in exchange for Na + absorption via ENaC leads to K + depletion, which impairs the correction of alkalosis by several mechanisms (see the following section). Angiotensin II has a direct effect on H + secretion in the proximal and distal nephron segments, contributing to enhanced absorption of HCO 3 − and the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in volume-depleted states.

### Genetic causes of primary aldosteronism [^1161rRLN]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In 1955, Conn reported a patient with hypertension, muscular weakness, paralysis, polydipsia, polyuria, and hypokalemic alkalosis who was cured after removal of a 4 cm adrenocortical adenoma (benign tumor of the adrenal cortex). He described this as a new syndrome of "primary aldosteronism" (PA). Currently, PA is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for up to 6% of hypertensive patients in primary care and up to 11% of patients in specialized referral centers; its prevalence increases with the severity of hypertension. PA is characterized by at least partially autonomous aldosterone production (despite low renin levels), hypertension and low or normal serum potassium levels. Common causes, include idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA; approximately 60% of the cases) and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA; approximately 30%), and rare subforms include unilateral hyperplasia, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), or familial hyperaldosteronism (FH). PA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation compared with primary hypertension –. In patients with hypertension, an elevated aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) is used as a screening parameter, followed by confirmatory testing (salt loading, fludrocortisone or captopril administration, which all fail to sufficiently lower aldosterone levels in PA). Imaging, such as computed tomography, serves to exclude malignancy, whereas so-called adrenal venous sampling, an invasive procedure, is typically required to distinguish unilateral (mostly APA) from bilateral (usually IHA) aldosterone production. However, adrenal venous sampling remains challenging, and hence, many patients are not diagnosed or treated optimally. While APAs can potentially be cured by surgery, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists remain the treatment of choice for IHA.

### Diagnosis and management of bartter syndrome: executive summary of the consensus and recommendations from the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network working group for tubular disorders [^111c5Vj5]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder characterized by secondary hyperaldosteronism with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and low to normal blood pressure. The primary pathogenic mechanism is defective salt reabsorption predominantly in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is significant variability in the clinical expression of the disease, which is genetically heterogenous with 5 different genes described to date. Despite considerable phenotypic overlap, correlations of specific clinical characteristics with the underlying molecular defects have been demonstrated, generating gene-specific phenotypes. As with many other rare disease conditions, there is a paucity of clinical studies that could guide diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. In this expert consensus document, the authors have summarized the currently available knowledge and propose clinical indicators to assess and improve quality of care.

### A pediatric conn syndrome case [^114LRbjR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Conn syndrome, which is rarely encountered in children, is characterized by increased aldosterone, low renin level, and arterial hypertension. Severe complications, such as impaired vascular smooth muscle function secondary to increased aldosterone, endothelial dysfunction, deterioration of left ventricular functions, acute effects on the cardiovascular system, and proteinuria, may be observed. We present a case of primary aldosteronism in a patient who has been followed up for approximately 2 years. A 15-year-old girl complained of headache lasting for approximately 1.5 years, which was diagnosed as severe hypertension. All of her systemic examinations were normal other than the hypertension. Primary aldosteronism was diagnosed on the basis of hypokalemia and alkalosis accompanied by plasma renin activity of 3.9 ng/mL/h and an aldosterone level of 1007 pg/mL (normal: 40–480). Left adrenalectomy was performed because a 10x12x12 mm adenoma was detected on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging. Although aldosterone levels returned to normal values after the surgery, antihypertensive treatment was continued because of the persistent hypertension. As the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure values of the patient were normal at 10 months after the operation, the treatment was stopped, and she was followed up for 15 months without any treatment. Since then, she has been normotensive.

Elevated P 2

The compensatory alveolar hypoventilation in metabolic alkalosis leads to hypercapnia (elevated arterial carbon dioxide; Pa 2), which blunts the rise in arterial pH due to elevated HCO 3 − concentration. Although hypercapnia occurs gradually as a respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis, it enhances the HCO 3 − reabsorptive capacity of the kidney tubules and thus prevents HCO 3 − excretion. Hypercapnia together with vascular volume depletion, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and mineralocorticoid excess contribute to the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Expanded States

In conditions associated with the primary increase in circulating mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids, the vascular volume is increased due to augmented salt absorption in the collecting duct (Fig 4B). The initiation of metabolic alkalosis in the aforementioned states is gradual and is primarily due to enhanced H + excretion in A-intercalated cells. This process is driven by increased luminal negative electrogenicity consequent to aldosterone-dependent Na + absorption via the apical sodium channel, ENaC (Fig 4B). A similar driving force enhances K + secretion into the lumen of the collecting duct, creating a state of K + wasting. The aldosterone-induced hypokalemia plays a critical role in the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis by increasing acid secretion and HCO 3 − absorption in several nephron segments as discussed previously (Fig 2B). Diseases such as primary aldosteronism and Cushing syndrome present with this abnormality, as does excess licorice ingestion. In conditions associated with primary stimulation of the RAAS (renal artery stenosis, renin-producing tumors, etc), increased angiotensin II levels intensify net acid excretion in the distal nephron, hence contributing to the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Recovery Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis

The recovery phase occurs when the existing deficits (volume, Cl −, or K +) are corrected, and the continued losses (via kidney or GI tract) are halted. Agents that are responsible for the loss of acid (ie, loop diuretics, licorice, etc) or gain of alkali (oral bicarbonate or citrate) need to be discontinued.

### Different roles of the RAAS affect bone metabolism in patients with primary aldosteronism, gitelman syndrome and bartter syndrome [^113DQCzZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study is based on a female patient treated by us recently who had hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid cancer. She developed severe osteoporosis with multi-bone fractures. We measured her renin and aldosterone levels since she had hypo-potassium and normal blood pressure. Surprisingly, renin was more than 500 (normal 2.8–39.9uIU/ml) and aldosterone was also significantly increased. The blood potassium, renin and aldosterone of the patient returned to normal 1 week after the operation without other interventions. We were impressed by this strong interaction between PTH and RAAS. We wonder what PTH level and bone mineral density would be in patients with persistent disordered RAAS?

Primary aldosteronism (PA), Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are three endocrine diseases with disordered RAAS. Primary aldosteronism (PA) as primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn's syndrome, is characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia, while Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) as secondary hyperaldosteronism, characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure, and metabolic alkalosis. Hypomagnesemia is less frequent than hypercalciuria in BS, while hypomagnesemia is an essential feature of GS, accompanied by hypocalciuria. The RAAS is disordered in PA, BS and GS; however, the pathogenesis is not the same. Elevated aldosterone in PA is from the proliferation of the adrenal gland or adrenal adenoma, and the increased aldosterone in turn inhibits the secretion of renin. Renal tubular ion exchange channel mutations are found in GS and BS patients, and this may induce the proliferation of juxtaglomerular cells and the elevation of renin secretion, followed by increased aldosterone secretion.

The interaction between the components of RAAS and PTH is well reviewed in the literature. It was found that plasma aldosterone level and ARR ratio were positively associated with plasma PTH level. High plasma PTH level can inactivate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and increase the expression of renin, which can also directly affect the synthesis and release of aldosterone in plasma. It has also been reported that a high level of aldosterone may have a negative effect on bone. However, there are few studies on whether the elevated aldosterone by different mechanisms may have the same effects on bone as PA, and whether this effect is mediated by PTH or other pathway. Therefore, we review the clinical data of Bartter and Gitelman syndrome patients and hope to answer the question.

Question 3:

Which one of the following conditions is the best explanation for the development of hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis in this patient?

Thiazide diuretic use for hypertension
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Sarcoidosis
Calcium-alkali (milk alkali) syndrome
Hypercalcemia of malignancy

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

The impact of metabolic alkalosis on the body is diverse and includes effects on the central nervous system (ranging from confusion to coma), peripheral nervous system (neuropathic symptoms such as tingling and numbness), myocardium (arrythmia), and skeletal muscle (weakness and twitching), among others. Some of these signs and symptoms could be due to severe electrolyte derangements either consequent to transcellular shifts (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) or secondary to altering the ratio of free to bound ions (calcium). Metabolic alkalosis is divided into 2 major categories based on whether ECF volume status is contracted or expanded (Box 1). Diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis is established by elevation in blood pH above 7.44 in the setting of high serum HCO₃⁻ concentration. Arterial blood gas (ABG), or a VBG at a minimum, is required if the diagnosis is in doubt (Fig 6).

A comprehensive patient history can uncover potential causes of metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting or excessive intake of diuretics, laxatives, exogenous HCO 3 −, or licorice. The history can also provide clues toward the presence of diseases such as primary aldosteronism, cystic fibrosis, or possible alkalosis-provoking medications (penicillin, carbenicillins, etc). Physical examination can help in establishing ECF volume contraction. A basic chemistry profile for Na +, K +, Cl −, Mg2 +, SUN, and Scr assists in evaluating kidney function and may provide clues toward the causes of alkalosis.

Based on the systemic blood pressure and urine electrolytes, patients with metabolic alkalosis are divided into chloride-sensitive (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) and chloride-resistant (urine Cl − > 20 mmol/L) groups (Fig 6).

Chloride-Resistant Alkalosis

The treatment of metabolic alkalosis with volume expansion (urine Cl − > 20 mmol/L and elevated blood pressure) is mainly directed at modification of the primary cause when associated with high mineralocorticoid states, and the correction of hypokalemia. Removing the source of mineralocorticoid excess, as in adrenal or pituitary tumors, is the cornerstone of this therapy. In other cases, such as in primary hyperaldosteronism, treatment could be pursued via direct hormone blockade with the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone) or via amiloride, an ENaC blocker. The effect of this blockade will enhance NaCl excretion and K + retention, thereby improving the patient's alkalosis and hypertension.

It is critical to identify and remove exogenous factors that could potentially contribute to mineralocorticoid stimulation (ie, licorice, carbenoxolone). Almost all cases of Cl − -resistant alkalosis are associated with hypokalemia; therefore, the correction of K + deficiency is essential to diminish the severity of metabolic alkalosis. The judicious use of oral or intravenous K + supplementation is advised, depending on the severity of the hypokalemia. Restriction of Na + and the addition of K + in the diet could help in improving the alkalosis. NCC will become active during hypokalemia, thus enhancing the salt absorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and worsening the hypertension. Correction of hypokalemia will restore NCC activity toward normal, and could potentially mitigate the severity of hypertension in individuals with Cl − -resistant metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111EuLrC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some important causes of metabolic alkalosis with variable volume status include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, refeeding syndrome, alkali loading in individuals with reduced GFR, and nonreabsorbable anions such as penicillin and carbenicillin.

Patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism require measurements of renin and aldosterone at baseline and, if necessary, following the saline suppression test. The diagnosis of Bartter, Gitelman, cystic fibrosis, and Pendred syndromes necessitates genetic testing. Diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β- or 17α-hydroxylase deficiency requires specific tests measuring the blood concentration of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, renin, and aldosterone, as well as cortisol and its 17-hydroxylated precursors.

Returning to case 2, thiazide overuse can produce hypercalcemia due to increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but will also cause other electrolyte disturbances such as profound hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are not observed in this patient. Further, the magnitude of hypercalcemia by thiazides is not expected to exceed levels above 14 mg/dL. Thus, option (a) is not the correct answer to Question 3.

Because the patient's PTH level is borderline low, primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia is unlikely. Further, a majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism develop nongap metabolic acidosis due to the direct inhibitory effects of PTH on proximal tubule function, hence option (b) is not correct. In hypercalcemia caused by granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D levels are significantly increased, which is not the case in this patient; thus, option (c) is not correct. Because the PTH-related peptide levels are undetectable, option (e) is incorrect.

The patient's findings of hypercalcemia (PTH-independent), metabolic alkalosis, and decreased kidney function are most likely caused by calcium alkali (milk alkali) syndrome. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of calcium along with an absorbable alkali. The disease was initially described in patients treated for peptic ulcer disease who used milk and sodium bicarbonate for symptomatic relief, but the current dominant etiology is associated with the use of over-the-counter calcium-containing medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or heartburn. Because of the change in the causative agents over the years, several scholars have suggested changing the name to calcium-alkali syndrome to accurately reflect the current pathogenesis of this disorder. Thus, the correct answer to Question 3 is (d).

Diuretic-Induced Metabolic Alkalosis

Inhibitors of Cl − absorption in both the kidney's thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule can generate metabolic alkalosis subsequent to the loss of salt (NaCl) and fluid. Thiazides (inhibitors of the Na + /Cl − cotransporter [NCC]) produce a mild metabolic alkalosis. By contrast, loop diuretics (furosemide and its analogs) can produce severe metabolic alkalosis consequent to the inhibition of NKCC2. The generation of metabolic alkalosis with loop diuretics is due to the combination of several sequential steps. It starts primarily with salt wasting, resulting in volume depletion and activation of the renin-aldosterone system (RAS). Next, the salt wasting increases the delivery of Na + (and Cl −) to the more distal segments, such as the connecting tubule and collecting duct, where Na + will be absorbed via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in exchange for K + (predominantly via the renal outer medullary K + channel [ROMK]) and H + secretion (via H + -ATPase and in part H + /K + -ATPase) (Fig 4A). These processes are significantly amplified in the presence of aldosterone (Fig 4B), which also has a direct effect on H + secretion in the medullary collecting duct.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide) are used as diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, they are also used for the treatment of various disorders including certain types of seizures, glaucoma, mountain sickness, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They cause HCO 3 − wasting by inhibiting HCO 3 − absorption in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct, resulting in nongap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis. In addition, they also cause K + wasting, which leads to hypokalemia. The patient in case 1 has metabolic alkalosis and not acidosis, so for Question 1, option (a) is not correct. Glucocorticoids at high concentrations, like those in ectopic corticotropin production, can bind and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor in principal cells, leading to the stimulation of salt absorption via ENaC and generation of hypertension. The absorption of Na + will increase K + and H + secretion into the urine, promoting hypokalemia and enhanced HCO 3 − absorption. The presence of hypertension is detected in the majority of patients with ectopic corticotropin secretion. The patient in case 1 presents with low blood pressure and tachycardia suggestive of intravascular volume depletion, so option (b) is not correct.

### Bartter syndrome and gitelman syndrome [^115bhrBv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are conditions characterized by renal salt-wasting. Clinical presentations range from severe antenatal disease to asymptomatic with incidental diagnosis. Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis is the common feature. Bartter variants may be associated with polyuria and weakness. Gitelman syndrome is often subtle, and typically diagnosed later life with incidental hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Treatment may involve fluid and electrolyte replenishment, prostaglandin inhibition, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system axis disruption. Investigators have identified causative mutations but genotypic-phenotypic correlations are still being characterized. Collaborative registries will allow improved classification schema and development of effective treatments.

### Pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis: a new classification based on the centrality of stimulated collecting duct ion transport [^114UPGgP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a unique acid-base disorder because it can be induced and sustained by functional alterations in renal ion transport. This review summarizes more than 50 years of research into the pathophysiologic processes causing this disorder. The evidence reviewed supports the hypothesis that virtually all forms of metabolic alkalosis are sustained by enhanced collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion, induced by stimulation of sodium uptake through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Enhanced collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion in metabolic alkalosis occurs most commonly secondary to changes in ion transport earlier along the nephron, but also can occur as the result of primary stimulation of ENaC. In both these settings, potassium secretion is stimulated, and abnormal potassium losses cause depletion of body potassium stores. Potassium depletion has a key role in sustaining metabolic alkalosis by stimulating renal hydrogen ion secretion, enhancing renal ammonium production and excretion, and downregulating sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle and early distal tubule. A new classification of the causes of metabolic alkalosis is proposed based on these pathophysiologic events rather than response to treatment.

Bicarbonate Absorption and Secretion in the Distal Nephron (Including the Collecting Duct)

The collecting duct plays a major role in systemic acid-base homeostasis by fine-tuning the excretion of acid and base. The cortical collecting duct comprises 3 cell types: A-intercalated cells, which secrete H⁺ (acid); B-intercalated cells, which secrete HCO₃⁻ (base); and principal cells, which absorb Na⁺ and water and secrete potassium ion (K⁺). H⁺ secretion by A-intercalated cells is primarily by apical H⁺-ATPases (and H⁺/K⁺-ATPases), generating new HCO₃⁻ under the control of cytosolic CAII. This HCO₃⁻ is delivered to the blood in exchange for Cl⁻ by the basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ anion exchange protein 1 (AE1).

As opposed to A-intercalated cells, which occur along the length of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts, B-intercalated cells are primarily localized to the cortical collecting duct and are rarely found in the medullary collecting duct. Thanks mostly to the apical Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger pendrin, B-intercalated cells secrete HCO₃⁻ into the cortical collecting duct lumen in exchange for luminal Cl⁻. The intracellular acid that results from HCO₃⁻ secretion in B-intercalated cells is transported into the blood by the basolateral H⁺-ATPase. The 3 major cell types in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) along with their apical and basolateral transporters involved in H⁺, HCO₃⁻, or electrolyte transport are shown in Figure 1.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl − absorption (and HCO 3 − secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO 3 − secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl − loss and impaired HCO 3 − secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl − in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO₃⁻ of 27 and K⁺ of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

We present a patient with hypertension and hypokalemia secondary to an aldosterone-producing adenoma that was renin responsive (APARR). We discussed the sequential approach to the diagnosis of the different subtypes of primary aldosteronism and confirmed the presence of an APARR. The most common cause of primary aldosteronism is an aldosteronoma; functionally, these adenomas respond poorly to angiotensin II but show a brisk response to adrenocorticotropin hormone. They have a pattern of aldosterone level that declines in parallel with cortisol levels. Our patient had an APARR, with an increase of aldosterone in the upright posture. The unusual physiologic response, incidence, and clinical characteristics of APARR are reviewed.

Bicarbonate Absorption, Secretion, and Generation in the Kidney: A Coordinated Interaction

Acid Secretion and Bicarbonate Reabsorption (Reclamation) by the Proximal Tubule

Approximately 85% to 90% of filtered HCO₃⁻ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, with the remaining being absorbed by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting ducts. Reabsorption of HCO₃⁻ in the proximal tubule is mediated via H⁺ secretion into the lumen principally through Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger 3 (NHE3) and the H⁺-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (H⁺-ATPase). Secreted H⁺ reacts with luminal HCO₃⁻ and rapidly dissociates to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and H₂O, catalyzed by the luminal membrane carbonic anhydrase (CAIV). The CO₂ enters proximal tubule cells where it is converted to HCO₃⁻ by cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CAII) before transportation to the blood via the basolateral Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransporter (NBCe1). Figure 1 includes a depiction of the role of apical NHE3 and H⁺-ATPase, basolateral NBCe1, and CAIV and CAII in H⁺ secretion and HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in the kidney proximal tubule.

INTRODUCTION

Gitelman syndrome is a recessive salt-wasting disorder characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Patients often present in late childhood or early adulthood with nonspecific symptoms, including muscle weakness, tetany, hypotension and fatigue. Typical complaints may also include salt craving and thirst as a reflection of salt-wasting. Gitelman syndrome is not a benign condition and may cause chondrocalcinosis due to hypomagnesemia, prolonged QTc interval and arrhythmias due to hypokalemia, glucose intolerance and immunodeficiencies. The disease was first described in 1966 by Hillel Gitelman as a subtype of Bartter syndrome. However, typical Bartter symptoms such as polyhydramnios, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, failure to thrive and an antenatal presentation are rare in Gitelman syndrome. Indeed, genetic investigations in the 1990 s revealed that Bartter and Gitelman syndrome are separate clinical entities.

Classic Gitelman syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in solute carrier 12 subtype 3 (SLC12A3) encoding the Na + -Cl − -co-transporter (NCC), which is exclusively expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The NCC facilitates apical Na + and Cl − transport in the DCT and is the therapeutic target of thiazide diuretics. As a consequence of impaired NCC-mediated Na + reabsorption in the DCT, the Na + delivery to the collecting duct is increased. Accompanied by RAAS activation, the high Na + delivery results in increased K + secretion in the collecting duct explaining the hypokalemia in Gitelman patients. The metabolic alkalosis develops secondary to hypokalemia. The hypomagnesemia is less well understood (extensively reviewed in), but it is generally thought that a reduced DCT mass is a major contributor to this defect. However, human data supporting this hypothesis are scarce.

In recent years, several seminal discoveries have been made to resolve the missing heritability in Gitelman syndrome. This review, therefore, provides an overview of all known genetic causes of Gitelman-like syndromes. The differences in clinical presentation, genetic inheritance and molecular disease mechanism will be discussed.

### The expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism: implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment [^112gUZuL]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is characterized by aldosterone secretion that is independent of renin and angiotensin II and sodium status. The deleterious effects of primary aldosteronism are mediated by excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor that results in the well-known consequences of volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but it also increases the risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as death. For decades, the approaches to defining, diagnosing, and treating primary aldosteronism have been relatively constant and generally focused on detecting and treating the more severe presentations of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is much greater than previously recognized, and that milder and nonclassical forms of renin-independent aldosterone secretion that impart heightened cardiovascular risk may be common. Public health efforts to prevent aldosterone-mediated end-organ disease will require improved capabilities to diagnose all forms of primary aldosteronism while optimizing the treatment approaches such that the excess risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease is adequately mitigated. In this review, we present a physiologic approach to considering the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of primary aldosteronism. We review evidence suggesting that primary aldosteronism manifests across a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to overt, that correlates with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we review emerging evidence from genetic studies that begin to provide a theoretical explanation for the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism and a link to its phenotypic severity spectrum and prevalence. Finally, we review human studies that provide insights into the optimal approach toward the treatment of primary aldosteronism.

A 68-year-old woman presented with right arm cellulitis, not responsive to oral antibiotics. Intravenous antibiotics were commenced, and an ultrasound scan confirmed a collection that was surgically drained. She developed refractory hypokalaemia with normal magnesium, no gastrointestinal losses and no iatrogenic cause. She was hypertensive, hyperglycaemic, alkalotic, clinically obese with proximal myopathy and skin bruising. These clinical findings and refractory hypokalaemic hypertension with metabolic alkalosis raised a suspicion of Cushing's syndrome (CS). 24-hour urinary free cortisol (24 hours) was grossly raised on two occasions. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly raised at 154ng/L, confirming ACTH-dependant CS. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis excluded an ectopic source of hypercortisolaemia.

Potassium Deficiency (or Hypokalemia)

Hypokalemia exerts multiple effects on kidney tubules with a net effect of maintaining the alkalosis, both in gastric or diuretic-induced alkalosis in volume depleted states, as well as in volume expanded states.

Hypokalemia, as well as metabolic acidosis, is a potent stimulator of ammoniagenesis by increasing glutamine uptake and enhancing the expression of ammoniagenic enzymes in the proximal tubule, ultimately resulting in the generation and addition of new HCO 3 − to the blood (Fig 2B). This added HCO 3 − may be maladaptive because it can either contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis (primary aldosteronism) or impede the correction of alkalosis in volume-depleted states with secondary hyperaldosteronism (vomiting or loop diuretic-induced alkalosis).

Hypokalemia stimulates HCO 3 − reabsorption by activating apical NHE3 and basolateral NBCe1 in the proximal tubule, enhancing H + -ATPase and AE1 activities in A-intercalated cells, and inducing the expression and activity of the nongastric H + /K + -ATPase in the collecting duct (Fig 2B). Furthermore, hypokalemia downregulates the expression of the HCO 3 − -secreting transporter pendrin in B-intercalated cells (Fig 2B). Collectively, these effects blunt the elimination of excess HCO 3 − in volume-depleted states (vomiting, overuse of loop diuretics, etc) or contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in volume-expanded states (primary aldosteronism).

In brief, hypokalemia is a critical contributor to the worsening of metabolic alkalosis, specifically in volume-depleted states, by (1) enhancing ammoniagenesis in proximal tubule cells, leading to new HCO 3 − generation; (2) increasing proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered HCO 3 −; (3) increasing HCO 3 − generation and absorption in the collecting duct A-intercalated cells; and (4) decreasing HCO 3 − secretion in the collecting duct B-intercalated cells.

Mineralocorticoid Excess and Metabolic Alkalosis

Almost all cases of metabolic alkalosis present with an excess of mineralocorticoids. Most represent RAS stimulation consequent to decreased intravascular volume, which encompasses conditions with either true vascular volume deficit (ie, vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or overuse of diuretics) or decreased effective vascular volume (ie, congestive heart failure). The other major category of metabolic alkalosis with increased mineralocorticoids encompasses patients with normal or expanded vascular volume such as in primary aldosteronism. The role of mineralocorticoid excess in the generation and or the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in volume-depleted or volume-expanded states will be discussed in the following sections.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Depleted States

The maintenance phase of metabolic alkalosis in disease states associated with ECF volume contraction refers to a period after the generation phase where the initiating factors responsible for increased arterial pH and HCO 3 − concentration (vomiting or diuretic overuse) may have abated but the metabolic alkalosis persists. Factors that impair the elimination of excess serum HCO 3 − will prevent the correction of metabolic alkalosis. The most important among these factors are decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) consequent to volume contraction, hypochloremia, K + deficiency, and steroid (aldosterone) excess. The role of these factors in the maintenance of gastric alkalosis and diuretic-induced alkalosis will be discussed in the following sections.

Decreased Kidney Perfusion

Both vomiting (or nasogastric suctioning) and chloruretic diuretic overuse are associated with ECF volume contraction consequent to the loss of Cl − -rich fluid in the stomach or kidney tubules, respectively, resulting in decreased kidney perfusion and GFR. The reduction in GFR reduces the amount of filtered HCO 3 −, preventing effective removal of excess HCO 3 − from the blood compartment.

Hypochloremia

Almost all patients with metabolic alkalosis and vascular volume depletion display both hypochloremia and kidney hypoperfusion (low GFR). Low serum Cl − directly results from the loss of Cl − into the lumen of the stomach and kidney tubules. This interferes with renal HCO 3 − excretion via several mechanisms, one of which is the impairment of HCO 3 − secretion in B-intercalated cells via pendrin (Fig 5A), which is inactivated both due to the low luminal Cl − concentration and the transcriptional downregulation consequent to K + depletion (Fig 5B).

Ingestion of absorbable antacids such as those containing HCO₃⁻ or CO₃²⁻ (carbonate) in the setting of diminished kidney function can lead to the generation of metabolic alkalosis due to impaired kidney excretion of HCO₃⁻. Absorbable HCO 3 − -containing medications, such as sodium bicarbonate, are usually used as a treatment to correct metabolic acidosis in CKD patients. The presence of significant hypokalemia and hypotension makes option (c) implausible for Question 1.

Many of the diseases that present with metabolic alkalosis are accompanied with K + depletion. Vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction can lead to metabolic alkalosis due to large gastric fluid losses via parietal cells as discussed under the gastric alkalosis section (Fig 3). Excessive loss of gastric fluid causes hypochloremia and ECF volume contraction, activates the RAS, and leads to hypokalemia due to renal K + wasting. The net effect of these factors is a significant elevation of serum HCO 3 − and arterial pH along with hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Vital signs (low blood pressure and tachycardia due to vascular volume depletion) and laboratory results (hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis) in case 1 fit this category of gastric loss-induced metabolic acidosis; thus, the best answer to Question 1 is (d).

Question 2:

Match each diagnosis with the correct clinical and laboratory presentation:

The overuse of loop diuretics is associated with volume contraction, which is consistent with a blood pressure of 95/57 mm Hg and with increased urine electrolytes. Ectopic corticotropin production presents with hypertension (blood pressure of 160/100 mm Hg) and increased urine electrolytes. Gastric outlet obstruction with vomiting presents with volume contraction (blood pressure of 95/57 mm Hg) and low urine Na + and Cl − excretion. Thus, the correct pairs are (a) and (2); (b) and (1); and (c) and (3).

### Primary hyperaldosteronism with normokalaemia secondary to an adrenal adenoma (conn's syndrome) in a 12 year-old boy [^114qQ8N3]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

A 12–1/2 year-old boy presented to the Accident Department following an episode of dizziness and was found to be hypertensive. Investigations revealed primary hyperaldosteronism secondary to an adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome). He had normal electrolytes during the period of investigation and potassium concentrations were ≥ 4.2 mmol/l on all but one occasion. The hypertension resolved following excision of the adrenal tumour. Normokalaemia with potassium > 4.0 mmol/l is very unusual in patients with Conn's syndrome and has not been described in childhood before. Primary hyperaldosteronism needs to be considered in hypertensive children even when potassium concentrations are well within the laboratory reference range.

### Acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis complicating respiratory failure with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a systematic review [^1114DUYo]. Thorax (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis may lead to respiratory inhibition and increased need for ventilatory support or prolongation of weaning from ventilation for patients with chronic respiratory disease. Acetazolamide can reduce alkalaemia and may reduce respiratory depression.

Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE and CENTRAL from inception to March 2022 for randomised controlled trials comparing acetazolamide to placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnoea, hospitalised with acute respiratory deterioration complicated by metabolic alkalosis. The primary outcome was mortality and we pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 (Risk of Bias 2) tool, heterogeneity was assessed using the I² value and χ² test for heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology.

Results

Four studies with 504 patients were included. 99% of included patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No trials recruited patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 50% of trials recruited patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Risk of bias was overall low to some risk. There was no statistically significant difference with acetazolamide in mortality (relative risk 0.98 (95% CI 0.28 to 3.46); p = 0.95; 490 participants; three studies; GRADE low certainty) or duration of ventilatory support (mean difference -0.8days (95%CI -7.2 to 5.6); p = 0.36; 427 participants; two studies; GRADE: low certainty).

Conclusion

Acetazolamide may have little impact on respiratory failure with metabolic alkalosis in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. However, clinically significant benefits or harms are unable to be excluded, and larger trials are required.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111ZchzG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Acetazolamide could increase the renal excretion of HCO₃⁻, potentially correcting her alkalosis, but will not help to correct this patient's hypercalcemia and volume depletion. Further, the beneficial effect of acetazolamide in enhancing HCO 3 − excretion is partly blunted in patients with ECF volume contraction. Finally, the use of acetazolamide is relatively contraindicated in kidney failure and should be used with extreme caution to avoid acetazolamide neurotoxicity consequent to impaired renal excretion. Thus, option (b) is not correct.

Aggressive volume expansion not only enhances calcium excretion but also increases HCO 3 − wastage. The improvement in the severity of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of hypercalcemia has significant therapeutic ramifications on both the salt wasting (from the thick limb), as well as the calcium excretion. The increase in extracellular pH due to metabolic alkalosis independently activates basolateral CaSR in the thick ascending limb of Henle and apical/basolateral CaSR in the distal convoluted tubule. Together, these processes initiate a self-perpetuating cycle by inhibiting salt absorption in the thick ascending limb and activating calcium absorption (via calcium transporter 2 [TRPV5]) in the distal convoluted tubules. For this reason, patients with hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis tend to recover relatively fast when this vicious circle is interrupted by the administration of high volumes of isotonic solutions. Aggressive volume expansion is the most important initial therapeutic maneuver in hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, making (c) the best answer to Question 4. Reports of aggressive volume expansion in conjunction with loop diuretics for the treatment of hypercalcemia with volume contraction have been published.

Even though bisphosphonates and occasionally calcitonin are considered first-line treatment in hypercalcemia, correction of volume depletion should be the first choice in the setting of hypercalcemia, volume depletion, and metabolic alkalosis, which is why options (d) and (e) are not correct.

The patient was started on a normal saline infusion at 200 mL/h and her calcium level and mental status improved 24 hours after admission.

### The genetic spectrum of gitelman (-like) syndromes [^112zHLWN]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Gitelman syndrome is a recessive salt-wasting disorder characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis and hypocalciuria. The majority of patients are explained by mutations and deletions in the SLC12A3 gene, encoding the Na + -Cl − -co-transporter (NCC). Recently, additional genetic causes of Gitelman-like syndromes have been identified that should be considered in genetic screening. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical, genetic and mechanistic aspects of Gitelman(-like) syndromes.

Recent findings

Disturbed Na + reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is associated with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemic alkalosis. In Gitelman syndrome, loss-of-function mutations in SLC12A3 cause impaired NCC-mediated Na + reabsorption. In addition, patients with mutations in CLCKNB, KCNJ10, FXYD2 or HNF1B may present with a similar phenotype, as these mutations indirectly reduce NCC activity. Furthermore, genetic investigations of patients with Na + -wasting tubulopathy have resulted in the identification of pathogenic variants in MT-TI, MT-TF, KCNJ16 and ATP1A1. These novel findings highlight the importance of cell metabolism and basolateral membrane potential for Na + reabsorption in the DCT.

Summary

Altogether, these findings extend the genetic spectrum of Gitelman-like electrolyte alterations. Genetic testing of patients with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia should cover a panel of genes involved in Gitelman-like syndromes, including the mitochondrial genome.

### Association between activating mutations of calcium-sensing receptor and Bartter's syndrome [^1149qGoL]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Bartter's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by deficient renal reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hyper-reninaemia and hyperaldosteronaemia. Mutations in several ion transporters and channels have been associated with the pathogenesis of Bartter's syndrome. We describe two hypocalcaemic patients with deficient parathyroid hormone secretion who also showed characteristics of Bartter's syndrome. We found activating mutations of the gene for the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) in both patients. Activation of this calcium-sensing receptor inhibits the activity of a renal outer-medullary potassium channel that is mutated in type 2 Bartter's syndrome. We therefore suggest that some activating mutations of CASR could provide new mechanisms for the development of Bartter's syndrome.

NONGENETIC CAUSES OF GITELMAN-LIKE ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITIES

Although it goes beyond the scope of this review to discuss all noninherited conditions that can mimic the presentation of Gitelman syndrome, it is important to consider alternative causes of Gitelman syndrome in clinical practice. In particular, abuse of diuretics (most notably thiazides) may result in an identical presentation. In addition, chronic use of proton-pump inhibitors, aminoglycosides or laxatives is accompanied by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, although metabolic alkalosis is generally absent. Other causes of hypokalemia may include chronic vomiting and primary hyperaldosteronism, but the latter condition is associated with hypertension and a suppressed RAAS. Further guidance on the clinical workup and treatment of Gitelman syndrome is provided by KDIGO.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^114EkykH]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study reveals that approximately 50% of SE patients present with an acid–base disorder within the first 24 h of SE according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.

About 35% of patients experienced respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, likely directly related to respiratory disfunction and/or lactate production. The antiepileptic effect of acidosis is well established: neuronal excitability and seizure activity are strongly suppressed by a decrease in brain and blood pH, with some anticonvulsants, such as acetazolamide, acting reducing extracellular brain pH. However, the prognostic role of acidosis in critically ill patients remains debated. Some studies associate acidosis to higher mortality, while others find no relationship with outcome, or even a correlation to better prognosis. In our study, we did not find a clear association between acidosis and outcomes, but a larger sample size may be needed to detect small differences.

In the first 24 h of SE, 15% of patients showed alkalosis, split evenly between metabolic and respiratory causes. The pathogenesis of alkalosis in SE is less clear, and likely influenced by the overall pathophysiological context. Alkalosis, especially metabolic alkalosis, has been recognized as a common acid–base disturbance in critically ill patients, increasing with invasive therapies like mechanical ventilation, gastric aspiration, and intravenous infusions. In our cohort, we assessed pH only in the very first stage of SE and only a small percentage of patients experienced alkalosis, with no relationship to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive therapies, suggesting their non-primary role in this context.

An increase in pH is associated with the generation of spontaneous interictal spikes in animal models, potentially contributing to the interictal–ictal transition. In this context, hyperventilation-induced alkalosis has long been used to induce seizure activity/electroencephalogram abnormalities as an activation test.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis and recurrent acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with Crohn's disease [^1126iQzx]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

In case intestinal adaptation fails to develop, long-term parenteral nutrition is mandatory. Complications of parenteral nutrition include catheter infections or occlusions, venous thrombosis and progressive cholestatic liver disease that often requires combined intestinal and liver transplantation at later stages. Intestinal transplantation is reserved for patients who are either not candidates or have developed complications from long-term parenteral nutrition and in whom adequate adaptation does not occur.

In our case stomal fluid losses led to recurrent acute kidney injury necessitating implantation of a port catheter for parenteral nutrition. Stomal fluid losses of ~5000 mL per day were substantial in the light of normal stool volume which is in the range of 150 ml/day. Under such conditions fecal electrolyte excretion is negligible (Na + 20–30 mmol/l, K + 55–75 mmol/l, Cl - 15–25 mmol/l). Due to the daily stool volume fecal chloride loss in our patient was markedly elevated and led to severe hypochloremia. Unfortunately, the arterial blood gas analyzer was unable to measure urinary or fecal bicarbonate concentrations. However, alkaluria (pH 8.5) suggests renal bicarbonate excretion as a compensatory mechanism in response to metabolic alkalosis. The latter was perpetuated by several mechanisms including volume contraction, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, secondary hyperaldosteronism and most importantly persisting acid losses via the stoma. In summary, our case highlights the complex nature of acid-base disturbances in patients with the short bowel syndrome.

### Recent advances in molecular genetics of hereditary magnesium-losing disorders [^111oMEbh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent advances in molecular genetics in hereditary hypomagnesemia substantiated the role of a variety of genes and their encoded proteins in human magnesium transport mechanisms. This knowledge on underlying genetic defects helps to distinguish different clinical subtypes and gives first insight into molecular components involved in magnesium transport. By mutation analysis and functional protein studies, novel pathophysiologic aspects were elucidated. For some of these disorders, transgenic animal models were generated to study genotype-phenotype relations and disease pathology. This review will discuss genetic and clinical aspects of familial disorders associated with magnesium wasting and focuses on the recent progress that has been made in molecular genetics. Besides isolated renal forms of hereditary hypomagnesemia, the following disorders will also be presented: familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, Ca2+/Mg2+-sensing receptor-associated disorders, and disorders associated with renal salt-wasting and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, comprising the Gitelman syndrome and the Bartter-like syndromes.

### Cystic fibrosis in the kidney: new lessons from impaired renal HCO3-excretion [^115U5QVT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A key role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the kidney has recently been uncovered. This needs to be integrated into the understanding of the developed phenotypes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.

Recent Findings

In the beta-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, CFTR functions in very similar terms as established in the exocrine pancreatic duct and both CFTR and SLC26A4 (pendrin) orchestrate regulated HCO3- secretion. Like in the pancreas, the hormone secretin is a key agonist to activate renal HCO3- secretion. In mice lacking CFTR or pendrin, acute and chronic base challenges trigger marked metabolic alkalosis because collecting duct base secretion is defective. Also in CF patients, the ability to acutely increase renal HCO3- excretion is markedly reduced.

Summary

The now much enlarged understanding of CFTR in the kidney may permit the measurement of challenged urine HCO3- excretion as a new biomarker for CF. We suggest a new explanation for the electrolyte disorder in CF termed Pseudo-Bartter Syndrome. The hallmark electrolyte disturbance features of this can be well explained by a reduced function of collecting duct Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Eventually, we suggest the diagnostic term distal renal tubular alkalosis to cover those disturbances that causes metabolic alkalosis by a reduced collecting duct base secretion.

### Pseudo gitelman syndrome associated with pregnancy [^111Nm9CF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome is a rare inherited renal tubulopathy associated with metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte disorders. Pseudo Gitelman syndrome presents with the same clinical characteristics as Gitelman syndrome, yet without genetic mutations in SLC12A3.

Case

A 32-year-old woman with no remarkable medical and family history developed hypokalemia at 32 weeks of gestation. Laboratory findings were consistent with Gitelman syndrome and potassium supplementation was initiated. The patient delivered a healthy neonate at 40 weeks of gestation and the electrolyte disorders drastically improved. After delivery, genomic analysis revealed no evidence of mutations in SLC12A3, and pseudo Gitelman syndrome was finally diagnosed.

Conclusion

Pseudo Gitelman syndrome, presenting with Gitelman syndrome-like renal tubulopathy without mutations in SLC12A3, can cause a temporary electrolyte imbalance based on the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Although pregnant women with isolated hypokalemia need not be evaluated for Gitelman or pseudo Gitelman syndrome, if it is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesia, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system without hypertension, this evaluation should be considered.

### Primary aldosteronism: renaissance of a syndrome [^117K8Mav]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary aldosteronism syndrome since Conn's description of the clinical presentation of a patient with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) more than 50 years ago. It is now recognized that the APA is just one of the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. APA and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Although most clinicians had thought primary aldosteronism to be a rare form of hypertension for more than three decades, it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. Using the plasma aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio as a case-finding test, followed by aldosterone suppression confirmatory testing, has resulted in much higher prevalence estimates of 5–13% of all patients with hypertension. In addition, there has been a new recognition of the aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with aldosterone excess. Although thought to be daunting and complex in the past, the diagnostic approach to primary aldosteronism is straightforward and can be considered in three phases: case-finding tests, confirmatory tests and subtype evaluation tests. Patients with hypertension and hypokalaemia (regardless of presumed cause), treatment-resistant hypertension (three antihypertensive drugs and poor control), severe hypertension (≥ 160 mmHg systolic or ≥ 100 mmHg diastolic), hypertension and an incidental adrenal mass, onset of hypertension at a young age or patients being evaluated for other forms of secondary hypertension should undergo screening for primary aldosteronism. In patients with suspected primary aldosteronism, screening can be accomplished by measuring a morning (preferably between 0800 and 1000 h) ambulatory paired random plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). An increased PAC:PRA ratio is not diagnostic by itself, and primary aldosteronism must be confirmed by demonstrating inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone suppression testing can be performed with orally administered sodium chloride and measurement of urinary aldosterone or with intravenous sodium chloride loading and measurement of PAC. Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with APA or unilateral adrenal hyperplasia results in normalization of hypokalaemia in all these patients; hypertension is improved in all and is cured in approximately 30–60% of them. In bilateral adrenal forms of primary aldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy seldom corrects the hypertension and they should be treated medically with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis and recurrent acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with Crohn's disease [^117Emqcc]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Severe metabolic alkalosis is a rare finding in patients with Crohn's disease. The most common acid-base disorder in these patients is metabolic acidosis due to D-Lactate uptake or gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss. In our patient metabolic alkalosis was triggered by gastrointestinal losses of volume and chloride, resulting in renal bicarbonate retention. Secondary hyperaldosteronism caused by volume depletion certainly contributed to metabolic alkalosis. However, gastrointestinal chloride loss (87 mmol/l) was particularly prominent. The acidic stool, the short intestinal transit time and the substantial improvement of chloride loss in response to proton pump inhibition all point to gastral HCl secretion. Intestinal inflammation may also lead to chloride secretion directly from the inflamed intestinal mucosa. Thus, inflammation reduces the intestinal expression of SLC26A3 a chloride transporter that is mutated in patients with congenital chloridorrhea. Acquired chloridorrhea has been described in patients with intestinal inflammation due to transplant rejection and may be related to downregulation of SLC26A3.

In our patient short bowel syndrome was associated with profound metabolic perturbations as evidenced by severe alterations in acid base homeostasis. Cornerstones in the treatment and management of severe metabolic alkalosis are adequate volume repletion as well as administration of potassium chloride since volume contraction, hypokalemia and hypochloremia are the key factors that maintain the condition. Volume contraction causes a rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration because there is contraction of the extracellular volume around a relatively constant quantity of extracellular bicarbonate. Hypokalemia stimulates intracellular shift of hydrogen, in the kidney hypokalemia stimulates the luminally expressed V-type H + -ATPase of type A intercalated cells in the connecting tubules. This results in proton secretion as well as bicarbonate reabsorption by basolateral chloride/bicarbonate exchangers. Hypochloremia reduces chloride reabsoprtion via the SLC26A4 (pendrin) encoded Cl - /HCO3 - exchanger that is positioned on the apical membrane of type B intercalated cells. This exchanger is tightly regulated and governs chloride and bicarbonate flux through the distal tubule. Consequently, the patient received large amounts of i.v. infusions together with potassium chloride.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^112Vk2pv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

While Bartter and Gitelman syndromes share similarities, including hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism and low/normal blood pressure, differences in the tubular segments where NaCl reabsorption is compromised produce different clinical pictures. Patients with Gitelman syndrome usually present in late childhood or early adulthood. Typically, patients with Gitelman syndrome have hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Conversely, type I and II Bartter syndrome patients usually present antenatally with polyhydramnios and postnatally with severe polyuria, hypercalciuria and early onset nephrocalcinosis. Patients with type III Bartter syndrome have variable phenotypes that, in some cases, are difficult to distinguish from Gitelman syndrome. The large phenotypic spectrum of Bartter III patients is most likely explained by variable expression of the pathogenic gene product in the TAL and DCT and by the possibility of partial compensation by other chloride channels, in particular, ClC-Ka in the TAL.

In recent years, several investigators have observed abnormal levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum phosphate in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. Patients with Bartter syndrome tend to have a high PTH. However, the prevalence and pathophysiology of hyperparathyroidism in these Bartter patients are unclear. Furthermore, data have been in part contradictory since a tendency towards both hyper- and hypophosphatemia has been described in Bartter syndrome. In patients with Gitelman syndrome, high PTH levels have only been described in patients that had parathyroid adenoma, while hypophosphatemia has been reported in several small studies and has been attributed to renal phosphate wasting.

To verify whether these observations from case reports and small series are prevalent in Bartter and Gitelman syndromes or just incidental findings, we analysed PTH and phosphate levels in a very large cross-sectional cohort of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome collected across Europe, including both paediatric and adult subjects.

### Adrenal mass causing secondary hypertension [^112UfmUx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most hypertensive patients have essential (primary) hypertension; only 5% to 10% have a secondary cause. Two clinical characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension are early onset (< 30 years of age) and severe hypertension (> 180/110 mm Hg). When faced with these findings, clinicians should consider a secondary cause of hypertension.

Case Report

A 22-year-old woman being evaluated for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department was noted to have severe persistent hypertension. Additional evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia. The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure management, electrolyte replacement, and further evaluation of presumed hyperaldosteronism. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large adrenal mass. Surgical resection was performed, leading to a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism caused by adrenal carcinoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Secondary hypertension is far less common than essential hypertension; however, considering the large volume of patients seen in emergency departments, it is likely that some will have secondary hypertension. Emergency physicians should be aware of the clinical characteristics that suggest secondary hypertension so that the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways can be pursued.

### Markers of potassium homeostasis in salt losing tubulopathies-associations with hyperaldosteronism and hypomagnesemia [^111gu14s]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Salt losing tubulopathies (SLT), most prominently Gitelman (GS) and Bartter-Syndrome (BS) represent the most frequent genetic tubular disorders. BS includes different types of autosomal-recessive inherited disorders (Type I-V) resulting in severely reduced electrolyte reabsorption by the thick ascending limb of Henle while GS is caused by mutations in the thiazide sensitive sodium chloride co-transporter (NCCT) gene. Typical clinical findings include renal loss of potassium (K +), magnesium (Mg 2+) and calcium (Ca 2+), leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis as well as increased renin and aldosterone levels.

Although earlier reports described patients with GS as mostly asymptomatic at presentation, Cruz et al. showed that in some patients quality of life (QoL) was markedly affected and comparable to other chronic diseases usually considered more severe such as diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. Since SLTs originate from genetic mutations and causal therapies are not available yet, the therapy rather focuses on alleviation of symptoms via electrolyte supplementation. However, little is known about the relationship of biochemical parameters with QoL parameters.

The normalization of serum-potassium levels is currently the most widely accepted treatment target and therefore used as primary endpoint in clinical trials. However, in even excellently designed randomized crossover trials, the increase of potassium with various treatment regimens was only mild and rarely within normal range. Moreover, potassium correction may remain refractory due to underlying magnesium deficiency. These findings question the role of serum K + as the ideal marker of potassium homeostasis in SLT since simultaneous Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ wasting may also impact QoL. These electrolyte disbalances are further known to increase the risk for cardiac events in SLTs and in the general population. Moreover, palpitations are a frequent symptom in SLTs which may per se affect QoL. Therefore, additional thorough cardiac evaluation is essential not only to diagnose clinically inapparent cardiac abnormalities but also to exclude cardiac disease as a cause of reduced QoL.

### Liddle syndrome with a SCNN1B mutation: a case report and systematic review [^11579by5]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liddle syndrome (LS), a rare autosomal dominant hypertensive disorder, results from overactivation of the renal tubular epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Pathologically, ENaC hyperactivity increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. First described by Grant Liddle in 1963, LS mimics primary aldosteronism but exhibits normal or low aldosterone levels, earning the term "pseudoaldosteronism". Untreated LS accelerates arteriosclerosis, renal impairment, retinopathy, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, arrhythmias, or sudden death, while chronic metabolic alkalosis can impair multiorgan function. Misdiagnosis as primary aldosteronism may lead to unnecessary surgery. We report a 16-year-old female with a SCNN1B mutation (p. Pro618Ser) lacking hypertension and systematically review genotype-phenotype correlations in SCNN1B-related LS.

### Primary aldosteronism: molecular medicine meets public health [^111J9k27]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Within a year of the discovery of aldosterone in 1953, a description of the first patient with primary aldosteronism (PA) signalled a dual trajectory for clinical and research interest in the hormone. Over the next 70 years, many of its intertwined physiological and pathological roles have become clear (Fig. 1). For much of this period, the clinical syndrome of PA has held the status of an endocrine curiosity. Perhaps because of the dramatic clinical features of the index case described by Jerome Conn (sustained, severe hypertension, marked hypokalaemia and an adrenal tumour large enough to be seen by adrenal venography), PA was for many decades after Conn's death considered a rare, relatively benign form of hypertension only to be suspected if the patient was profoundly hypokalaemic –. However, the characterization of PA as a rare, benign disease with a requirement for hypokalaemia is now acknowledged to be incorrect.

Over the past decade, clinical and molecular studies have catapulted PA onto the centre stage of cardiometabolic research. First, several rigorous clinical studies that used plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), rather than absolute thresholds of plasma aldosterone itself, indicated prevalence rates for PA of 5–11% in unselected hypertensive populations – a range that is uncannily similar to Conn's prediction of 10% –. On top of these prevalence figures, the observation that the cardiometabolic consequences of PA (including stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal impairment and ischaemic heart disease) exceeded that of essential hypertension by a ratio of at least 2:1, provides an impetus to advance screening strategies and targeted therapies for PA. We and others have estimated that fewer than 1% of cases of PA are detected and treated; this underdiagnosis combined with the excess morbidity attributed to PA makes it difficult to exaggerate the public health consequences of this shortfall in clinical care.

### Torsade de pointes – a rare presentation of primary hyperaldosteronism [^111GRfFe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism was the most common form of endocrine hypertension resulting in hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Ventricular arrhythmia in association with primary hyperaldosteronism is an uncommon presentation that has previously been described in literature. We presented one case of torsades de pointes due to primary hyperaldosteronism.

### Regulation of blood pressure and salt balance by pendrin-positive intercalated cells: Donald seldin lecture 2020 [^113ZpS2W]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Intercalated cells make up about a third of all cells within the connecting tubule and the collecting duct and are subclassified as type A, type B and non-A, non-B based on the subcellular distribution of the H + -ATPase, which dictates whether it secretes H + or HCO 3 -. Type B intercalated cells mediate Cl - absorption and HCO 3 - secretion, which occurs largely through the anion exchanger pendrin. Pendrin is stimulated by angiotensin II via the angiotensin type 1a receptor and by aldosterone through MR (mineralocorticoid receptor). Aldosterone stimulates pendrin expression and function, in part, through the alkalosis it generates. Pendrin-mediated HCO 3 - secretion increases in models of metabolic alkalosis, which attenuates the alkalosis. However, pendrin-positive intercalated cells also regulate blood pressure, at least partly, through pendrin-mediated Cl - absorption and through their indirect effect on the epithelial Na + channel, ENaC. This aldosterone-induced increase in pendrin secondarily stimulates ENaC, thereby contributing to the aldosterone pressor response. This review describes the contribution of pendrin-positive intercalated cells to Na +, K +, Cl - and acid-base balance.

### Lactic alkalosis in intensive care: a red flag? [^116TjeRb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Association between lactate measurement and alkalosis. Panel A: Box plot of lactate measurement as a function of the associated pH category. Red dots show the 90th percentile of lactate measurement in each category. Panel B: Box plot of lactate measurement according to the category of alkalosis: metabolic (orange), or respiratory

An association between alkalosis and mild hyperlactatemia has been described before in numerous case reports of extreme alkalosis, of both respiratory and metabolic origin. Bersin et al. introduced the concept of "primary lactic alkalosis" in a study describing a small case series along with an experimental demonstration of the pH-induced hyperlactatemia in a swine model of metabolic alkalosis. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain its pathophysiology: First, alkalosis stimulates glycolysis by increasing the activity of phosphofructokinase, which is sensitive to both pH itself and to alkalosis-induced sympathetic hyperactivation; second, alkalosis-induced left shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve decreases oxygen tissue extraction, which may explain the decrease in oxygen consumption observed in the seminal study by Bersin. During exercise in man, experimental studies observed the same positive correlation between pH and lactate output, which was interpreted as a protective mechanism to regulate cellular acid production and protect muscle pH. In a cohort of patients with psychogenic respiratory alkalosis, hyperlactatemia was present in 30% of patients and was mainly correlated to pH and PaCo 2 without any relation to adverse events, suggesting that "lactic alkalosis" does not carry the same prognostic value as lactic acidosis. In a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients, alkalosis was not associated with increased mortality but was significantly associated with prolonged ICU stay, although lactate was not available, preventing the exploration of its prognosis value in this particular context.

Overall, very little is known about lactic alkalosis in intensive care, and our findings encourage us to explore further the relationship between alkalosis, lactate and outcome in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, it could be useful for the clinician to know that mild, isolated hyperlactatemia in a patient with alkalosis should be interpreted with caution and is not necessarily a "red flag" that should lead to inappropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Mechanisms in hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis [^1152VKcy]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The form of renal tubular acidosis associated with hyperkalemia is usually attributable to real or apparent hypoaldosteronism. It is therefore a common feature in diabetes and a number of other conditions associated with underproduction of renin or aldosterone. In addition, the close relationship between potassium levels and ammonia production dictates that hyperkalemia per se can lead to acidosis. Here I describe the modern relationship between molecular function of the distal portion of the nephron, pathways of ammoniagenesis, and hyperkalemia.

Screening strategy for PA in hypertension

In the NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS), clinical features of PA include hypokalaemia (spontaneous or thiazide-induced), metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate) and plasma sodium level greater than 140 mmol/L. Symptoms are non-specific, but might very rarely include tetany, muscle weakness, nocturia, or polyuria. Although these features undoubtedly help identify patients who are likely to present with PA, their absence should not exclude patients from being investigated, as most patients with PA are asymptomatic. Moreover, hypokalaemia which was considered a cardinal feature of PA occurs only in a minority of patients, and symptoms are even more rare. It is now commonly accepted that PA should not be considered a rare clinical phenotype but a form of hypertension characterized by autonomous aldosterone secretion which can coexist with normokalaemia and morphologically normal adrenal glands.

Table 1 summarizes the clinical scenarios in which the BIHS recommends diagnostic work-up for suspected PA among patients with arterial hypertension. The list includes three clinical situations more frequently associated with PA, and the screening of young subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension. In the latter group, routine screening for PA can be considered to facilitate an early diagnosis followed by a targeted treatment strategy. Despite most expert guidelines recommending screening for PA in these clinical conditions (such as resistant hypertension), in clinical practice only a fraction of the eligible patients are likely to be evaluated. Some practical guidelines also recommend screening patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (although this indication has been questioned), as well as subjects with evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) "more severe" than expected from severity and duration of hypertension. There is evidence that aldosterone — in the presence of high salt intake — can contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis through mechanisms that are at least partly independent of its effects on blood pressure. However, no clinically meaningful reference values are available to define this "inappropriate" remodelling. Finally, in the PAPPHY (Prospective Appraisal of the Prevalence of Primary aldosteronism in HYpertensive patients) study, the prevalence of PA amongst patients with atrial fibrillation was almost four-times higher than in resistant hypertension. However, considering that atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the general population (as well as in subjects with hypertension) and that conflicting data exist on the prevalence of PA in this group, the cost effectiveness of systematic screening in these patients warrants evaluation.

### Different roles of the RAAS affect bone metabolism in patients with primary aldosteronism, gitelman syndrome and bartter syndrome [^112dyphb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Subjects and methods

Study subjects

The study population consisted of 57 patients, 30 men aged 15–55 years old and 27 women aged 15–66 years old. All patients enrolled in this study were inpatients who underwent detailed medical history, the general symptoms, signs and laboratory examination (including blood, urine, stool routine, biochemical tests, thyroid function, adrenocortical function, 24 h urine free cortisol, serum sex hormone, 24 h urine VMA, growth hormone and IGF-1). Patients who had a past or current disease that affects bone metabolism (such as pregnancy or lactation, nutritional diseases and gastrointestinal diseases, blood disease, chronic renal failure, low phosphorus, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, gonad hypofunction, hyperprolactinemia, diabetes, acromegaly and family hereditary metabolic bone disease, etc.) or who were taking drugs that affect bone metabolism (Such as glucocorticoids, heparin, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants) were excluded. Exclusion criteria also include deficiency of potassium intake, vomiting, chronic use of diuretics or laxatives, and other causes of tubular dysfunction.

In all patients, aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) screening tests were performed after adequate pharmacological elution of all interfering antihypertensive agents for at least 4 weeks.

Twenty patients were diagnosed with GS according to the following criteria: 1) decreased serum potassium below the 3.5 mmol/L and because of the renal reasons; 2) decreased serum magnesium below the 0.7 mmol/L; 3) decreased urinary calcium; 4) metabolic alkalosis; 5) increased serum renin; 6) Low or normal-low blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg); 7) normal kidney ultrasound performance; 8) combined with SLC12A3 gene mutation.

Seventeen patients with BS according to the following criteria: 1) decreased serum potassium below the 3.5 mmol/L and because of the renal reasons; 2) decreased serum magnesium below the 0.7 mmol/L;3) normal or increased urinary calcium; 4) metabolic alkalosis; 5) increased serum renin; 6) Low or normal-low blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg); 7) normal kidney ultrasound performance; 8) combined with CLCNKB gene mutation.

### Primary distal renal tubular acidosis: toward an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis [^112LKo1s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The term classic, type 1 renal tubular acidosis or primary distal renal tubular acidosis is used to designate patients with impaired ability to excrete acid normally in the urine as a result of tubular transport defects involving type A intercalated cells in the collecting duct. The clinical phenotype is largely characterized by the complications of chronic metabolic acidosis (MA): stunted growth, bone abnormalities, and nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis that develop as the consequence of hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. All these manifestations are preventable with early and sustained correction of MA with alkali therapy. The optimal target for plasma bicarbonate should be as close as possible to the range considered normal by current standards (between 23 and 28 mEq/L.). Most of the benefits of alkali therapy are tangible early in the course of the disease in childhood, but life-long treatment is required to prevent the vast array of complications attributable to chronic MA.

### A case report of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II with a homozygous KLHL3 variant accompanied by hyperthyroidism [^116jsgzi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

PHAII is a rare type of monogenic hypertension characterized by hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypercalciuria and otherwise normal renal function. It is also described as the opposite of Gitelman syndrome, which presents with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia. Increased reabsorption of urinary sodium through NCCs in DCT cells is the main pathophysiological mechanism of PHAII. Decreased urinary potassium excretion is secondary to increased Na + reabsorption and leads to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. As a result of hyperkalemia and volume expansion, the renin level is low, and aldosterone is normal or low.

Variable mutations in genes including WNK1, WNK4, KLHL3 and CUL3 are reported to be causative for PHAII. WNK (especially WNK4) regulates the activities of NCC, the epithelial Na + channel ENaC, and the K + channel ROMK in the DCT. Among them, NCC has a crucial role in the development of PHAII. In addition, WNK is controlled through ubiquitination by KLHL3/CUL3. The KLHL3 protein recruits substrates for CUL3-based ubiquitin ligase complexes and downregulates NCC expression. KLHL3 knockout mice exhibit PHAII-like phenotypes. Hypercalciuria in PHAII may occur due to decreased calcium reabsorption in DCT. The expression of epithelial Ca + channels in the DCT, including transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subtype 5 (TRPV5), TRPV6, and calbindin-D28k (CBP-D28k), is involved in the mechanism. Animal studies found that mutations in WNK4 downregulate TRPV6 and CBP-D28k and lead to decreased calcium reabsorption.

### Bilateral cochlear implantation in infantile Bartter's syndrome [^115qa7Cv]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Bartter's syndrome (BS) is a rare group of hereditary salt losing tubulopathies due to impairment of renal transport mechanism. Herein, we report a boy in early childhood who was diagnosed to have infantile Bartter's syndrome. Laboratory investigations revealed hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis which was managed with oral potassium chloride supplementation. The inner ear showed no anatomical abnormalities. Sequential cochlear implantation was performed 4 months apart. Postoperative electrical stimulation yielded good response and a symmetric mapping. The patient was on regular audio-verbal therapy. Cognitive impairment improved over time. Bilateral cochlear implantation showed excellent auditory outcomes.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^112RHk1M]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a heterogeneous neurological emergency with significant variability in prognosis, influenced by underlying disease and pathophysiological context. Acid–base disturbances are common in critically ill patients, yet their distribution and impact in SE patients remain poorly understood.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study including non-hypoxic SE patients with available blood gas analysis within the first 24 h of SE, treated at the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland between 2015 and 2023. Acid–base disturbances were classified using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, with prevalent metabolic alkalosis confirmed through the Stewart approach. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and return to premorbid neurologic function.

Findings

Among 540 SE patients, 365 were included. Half of patients exhibited acid–base disturbances within the initial 24 h of SE, with metabolic and respiratory acidosis being the most prevalent, though not prognostically significant. After correction for possible confounders, metabolic alkalosis (6%) was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (P = 0.011; OR = 4.87, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), worse GOS (P = 0.012; OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), and reduced likelihood of returning to premorbid function (P = 0.017; OR = 3.30, CI95% = 1.24–8.80). Following the Stewart approach, 9% of patients had predominant metabolic alkalosis, associated with worse GOS (P = 0.005; OR:3.37, 95%CI = 1.45–7.82), and reduced chance of returning to baseline (P = 0.012; OR = 3.29, CI95% = 1.30–8.32). Metabolic alkalosis was related to hypoalbuminemia and lower serum potassium.

Conclusion

Metabolic alkalosis strongly predicts mortality and adverse functional outcome in SE patients. Prospective studies should assess whether early detection and correction of metabolic alkalosis and related electrolyte imbalances can improve SE prognosis.

### Variant of pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome: hypertension and hypokalemia associated with normoreninemic normoaldosteronism [^112D6gcJ]. Hypertension Research (2002). Low credibility.

The case of a 48-year-old woman with a left adrenocortical adenoma and showing hypokalemia, hypertension and normoreninemic normoaldosteronism is reported. Basal plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels were within the reference ranges. The patient's plasma cortisol level decreased insufficiently at night, and was insufficiently decreased by nighttime administration of dexamethasone. She showed no Cushingnoid stigmata. Iodocholesterol scintigraphy revealed tumor-sided uptake alone. The plasma dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate level was low-to-normal for her age. Metabolic alkalosis and increased potassium clearance after sodium thiosulfate loading were revealed. The plasma aldosterone level was within the normal range, but it was statistically higher than the range for patients with pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome. However, peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) increased normally after the patient resumed an upright posture following furosemide administration. After adenomectomy the hypokalemia and hypertension were resolved, and the plasma ACTH, cortisol, and PRA remained within the reference ranges. The plasma aldosterone level decreased slightly, but also remained within the reference range after adenomectomy. Paradoxical hyperplasia in the non-neoplastic adrenal glomerulosa zone, which indicates primary aldosteronism, and slight atrophy of the non-neoplastic adrenal cortex, which indicates pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome, were demonstrated. These findings satisfied the criteria of pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome, but did not completely satisfy those of primary aldosteronism. However, the level of CYP11 B2 mRNA in the tumor was in the lower-limit of the range for adenomas associated with primary aldosteronism and was higher than the ranges for adenomas associated with pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome and overt Cushing's syndrome. Based on these results, this case was suspected to constitute a variant of pre-clinical Cushing's syndrome with slight hypersecretion of aldosterone.

### Magnesium biology [^116VMHFr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Genetic hypomagnesemia

In the last two decades, several hereditary causes of hypomagnesemia have been identified. Although it goes beyond the scope of this review to describe each individual gene, the genetic causes of hypomagnesemia can be grouped by their disease mechanisms. Mutations affecting the paracellular Mg 2+ transport pathway in the TAL (CLDN16, CLDN19, RRAGD, CASR) results in the hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. In the DCT, mutations in TRPM6 or TRPM7 cause hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia. Additionally, patients with disturbed Na + reabsorption in the DCT present with a Gitelman-like syndrome, characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and metabolic alkalosis (SLC12A3, CLCNKB, KCNJ10, KCNJ16, ATP1A1, FXYD2, HNF1B, PCBD1). In recent years, hypomagnesemia has also been described in patients with mitochondrial disorders (MT-TI, MT-TF, SARS2 and others). Other causes of isolated hypomagnesemia include KCNA1, EGF and CNNM2. Although the mechanisms that explain the interplay between Na + and Mg 2+ reabsorption in the DCT are only partially understood, decreased DCT length seems to contribute to Mg 2+ wasting in Gitelman-like syndromes. Mutations in CLDN10 have been associated with hypermagnesemia, while in vivo studies in CLDN10 KO mice resulted in hypermagnesemia.

All genetic causes of hypomagnesemia have been recently reviewed by de Baaij et al. (2023) and have been summarized in Table 1.

### A causality dilemma: ARFID, malnutrition, psychosis, and hypomagnesemia [^1119dicU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

We present a novel case of a woman with coincident occurrence of auditory and visual hallucinations, electrolyte disturbances, chloride unresponsive alkalosis, and an eating disorder. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome comorbid with schizophreniform disorder and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. Eating disorders are often associated with electrolyte abnormalities which, in turn, can cause or contribute to other neuropsychiatric symptoms. At the same time, psychotic disorders can lead to food intake aversions or overconsumption of fluids with associated effects on electrolyte balance. In this case, a third factor, Gitelman syndrome, resulted in persistent hypomagnesemia with metabolic alkalosis and, while separate from her eating disorder, simultaneously reinforced the patient's strong food preferences, excessive fluid intake, and excessive movement related to her complaints of persistent joint pain.

### New-onset resistant hypertension in a newly diagnosed prostate cancer patient [^115ZRZ1C]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New onset resistant hypertension in a previously stable patient with chronic hypertension should lead to consideration of secondary causes. Electrolyte abnormalities are useful clues for identifying some common causes, especially mineralocorticoid excess.

Case Presentation

We report the case of a 69-year-old man who developed severe resistant hypertension despite the use of 6 antihypertensive medications, including diuretics. He had metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia with suppressed plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone. Concurrently, he was diagnosed with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate gland, a rare form of prostate cancer. Despite absence of typical Cushingoid features, investigation confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome from neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Because of the severity of his hypercortisolism, he underwent urgent bilateral adrenalectomy for hormonal and symptomatic control. Blood pressure improved significantly and he was dismissed with a single antihypertensive agent. Unfortunately, the patient died from his cancer 1 month later.

Conclusion

Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism are usually diagnosed based on measurements of aldosterone and plasma renin activity. However, if plasma renin activity and aldosterone are both low, rare causes of mineralocorticoid excess such as ectopic ACTH syndrome should be entertained.

### Low potassium activation of proximal mTOR / AKT signaling is mediated by kir4.2 [^11438mGn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Kir4.2 is essential for the physiological K + response

Kir4.2 deletion abrogated an increase in gross kidney size in response to low K + feeding. Optical clearing and three-dimensional confocal imaging revealed a lack of tubule expansion along the PT in Kir4.2 −/− animals. Conversely, the hypertrophic response along the DCT was not only intact, but appeared exaggerated relative to Kir4.2 +/+ mice. The absent change in knockout kidney weight identifies the PT as the site for most of the renal hypertrophic response. While the DCT does undergo hypertrophy, this is at the expense of a reduction in CNT massleaving the distal nephron size as a whole unchanged in the low K + setting. Along with an absence of PT expansion, knockouts failed to compensate physiologically for dietary K + deficiency showing the increase in mass is coupled to changes in transport. They wasted urinary K + leading to more severe hypokalemia and acidosis compared with controls. These findings highlight an essential PT role for Kir4.2 in identifying and responding to changes in blood K + levels.

Kir4.2 forms functional heterotetramers with Kir5.1 in vitroand evidence suggests this occurs in vivo along the PT. While human disease-causing Kir4.2 mutations have not been identified, Kir5.1 mutations were reported to cause hypokalemia, renal Na + wasting, acid-base disturbances, and sensorineural deafness. This syndrome closely resembles SeSAME/EAST syndrome, which is caused by mutations in Kir4.1 (which heterotetramerizes with Kir5.1 along the DCT), and includes a kidney phenotype resembling a Gitelman tubulopathy. A clinical difference between the two syndromes relates to acid-base disturbances; Kir4.1 mutations invariably cause alkalosis, secondary to NCC inhibition, while Kir5.1 mutations are more variable with a subset of patients presenting with acidosis while others have alkalosis. Heterogeneity likely relates to Kir5.1 serving distinct roles along the PT and DCT and whether patients have predominantly proximal or distal disruption of transport processes. The novel syndrome suggests intact Kir4.2 function, through its interactions with Kir5.1, is essential to maintain normal physiology in humans.

### Novel SLC12A3 mutation in gitelman syndrome [^111HRVS2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by the presence of hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. The prevalence of this disease is 1–10/40 000. GS is usually associated with mild and non-specific symptoms and many patients are only diagnosed in adulthood. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene. We present the case of a 49-year-old man referred to a nephrology appointment due to persistent hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Complementary evaluation revealed hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninaemia, increased chloride and sodium urinary excretion, and reduced urinary calcium excretion. Renal function, remainder serum and urinary ionogram, and renal ultrasound were normal. A diagnosis of GS was established and confirmed with genetic testing which revealed a novel mutation in SLC12A3 (c.1072del, p.(Ala358Profs*12)). This novel mutation extends the spectrum of known SLC12A3 gene mutations and further supports the allelic heterogeneity of GS.

### Apparent mineralocorticoid excess: time of manifestation and complications despite treatment [^113rWqm7]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Here we describe the case of a patient followed from birth because of a positive family history for apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) in an older brother. The patient, a girl, had normal serum electrolyte and blood pressure measurements in the first months after birth. Not until the age of 11 months did she develop anorexia and failure to thrive in combination with hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, which are consistent with the diagnosis of AME. This diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis of the HSD11B2 gene (C1228T). Treatment with amiloride and furosemide electrolyte disturbances normalized her blood pressure. At the age of 19 years she unexpectedly suffered a stroke. Additional investigations revealed no accepted risk factor for stroke. We discuss the possible underlying mechanisms for the delayed manifestation of hypertension and electrolyte disturbances in AME, propose an additional explanation for the stroke in this patient, and advise treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to reduce stroke risk in patients with AME.

Metabolic alkalosis, isolated or in combination with another abnormality, is the most common acid-base disorder in patients with congestive heart failure. In most cases, it is a result of diuretic therapy, which causes activation of the renin-angiotensin system, chloride depletion, increased distal sodium delivery, hypokalemia, and increased urine acidification, all of which contribute to bicarbonate retention. In addition, the disease state itself results in neurohormonal activation (renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic nervous system, and endothelin) that further amplifies the tendency toward alkalosis. Treatment of metabolic alkalosis is based on the elimination of generation and maintenance factors, chloride and potassium repletion, enhancement of renal bicarbonate excretion (such as acetazolamide), direct titration of the base excess (hydrochloric acid), or, if accompanied by kidney failure, low-bicarbonate dialysis. In congestive heart failure, appropriate management of circulatory failure and use of an aldosterone antagonist in the diuretic regimen are integral to treatment.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^113V8awq]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several reports highlighted that the presence of metabolic alkalosis is associated with longer ICU stays and increased mortality in patients with various diseases. In our cohort, metabolic alkalosis at admission was a strong indicator of higher mortality, worse GOS, and a lower likelihood of returning to baseline even after correction for potential confounders.

Our findings were further validated using the Stewart approach, which, despite being more complex and less user-friendly for clinical practice, offers a more detailed and precise assessment of acid–base disorders, particularly in critical care settings. According to the Stewart method, predominant metabolic alkalosis was associated with all primary outcomes in univariate analysis and remained significantly linked to a reduced likelihood of good functional outcomes after binomial regression.

Metabolic alkalosis may directly contribute to poor outcomes or be an indicator of other adverse factors. Some studies suggest that metabolic alkalosis directly impacts outcomes by reducing respiratory input, inhibiting hemoglobin dissociation and causing electrolytes imbalance. We analyzed the number of patients with metabolic alkalosis according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach who normalized their pH levels within the subsequent 24 h: of 17 patients with available data, the normalization of pH had no clear impact on prognosis, but the extremely small sample size warrants caution in interpretation.

While alkalosis may contribute directly (e.g. through respiratory depression), other factors likely play a significant role in reducing the likelihood of good outcome for alkalosis patients in our cohort. We found a significant correlation between metabolic alkalosis, hypoalbuminemia, and lower serum potassium. The association between alkalosis and hypoalbuminemia is well established, as well as the bidirectional relationship among metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia.

Hypoalbuminemia is a well-known predictor of poor outcomes across various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sepsis, and it might be considered as a reliable biomarker of overall patient's resources to survive SE. Similarly, low serum potassium has been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, including an increased risk of respiratory insufficiency, with a reduced capacity to wean from mechanical ventilation.

### Fanconi syndrome and severe polyuria: an uncommon clinicobiological presentation of a gitelman syndrome [^112sfQP5]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis and hypocalciuria. The majority of patients do not present with symptoms until late childhood or adulthood, and the symptoms are generally mild. We report here the first case of Gitelman syndrome presenting with the biological features of Fanconi syndrome and an early polyuria since the neonatal period. We discuss in this article the atypical electrolytes losses found in our patient, as well as the possible mechanisms of severe polyuria.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old Caucasian girl was admitted via the Emergency department for vomiting, and initial laboratory investigations found hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap, hypophosphatemia, and hypouricemia. Urinalysis revealed Na, K, Ph and uric acid losses. Thus, the initial biological profile was in favor of a proximal tubular defect. However, etiological investigations were inconclusive and the patient was discharged with potassium chloride and phosphorus supplementation. Three weeks later, further laboratory analysis indicated persistent hypokalemia, a metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. We therefore sequenced the SLC12A3 gene and found a compound heterozygosity for 2 known missense mutations.

Conclusions

Gitelman syndrome can have varying and sometimes atypical presentations, and should be suspected in case of hypokalemic tubular disorders that do not belong to any obvious syndromic entity. In this case, the proximal tubular dysfunction could be secondary to the severe hypokalemia. This report emphasizes the need for clinicians to repeat laboratory tests in undiagnosed tubular disorders, especially not during decompensation episodes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common endocrine cause of secondary hypertension. However, PA is underdiagnosedwith reported prevalence rates among patients with hypertension of 4%–14%, in primary care and 1%–29.8% in referral centres. The disease is characterised by hypertension, hypokalemia/normokalemia and metabolic alkalosis with diffuse clinical features such as muscle weakness, fatigue, polyuria and polydipsia. The cause is autonomous aldosterone production which results in sodium and water retention as well as renal potassium excretion. The excess production of aldosterone may occur in one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) adrenal glands. The unilateral disease is usually caused by a solitary adenoma and represents only one‐third of all PA cases. Bilateral disease is caused by bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia or, rarely, by bilateral adenomas.

Patients with PA have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Due to the recognised efficiency of PA treatment (surgery and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment) and its positive impact on patient outcomes, including health cost gains, screening of risk populations for PA is important and beneficial.

Even though PA is a common disorder among patients with hypertension, only a relatively small number of patients undergo investigation for PA. For example, recent studies show that only 2.1%–2.7% of patients with hypertension were screened for PA.

The diagnosis of PA requires not only laboratory tests but often also complex confirmatory tests, radiological assessment and adrenal vein sampling for distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease. In PA, the increase in aldosterone is independent of renin pathway regulation, causing the suppression of renin secretion and, hence, elevation of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR). However, the ARR can be altered by other factors, such as medications interfering with the Renin‐Angiotensin‐Aldosterone System (RAAS), oral contraceptives or chronic kidney disease, why confirmatory tests are most often required to establish the diagnosis of PA.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Acid-base disorders in liver disease [^113ETRKi]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Alongside the kidneys and lungs, the liver has been recognised as an important regulator of acid-base homeostasis. While respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder in chronic liver disease, various complex metabolic acid-base disorders may occur with liver dysfunction. While the standard variables of acid-base equilibrium, such as pH and overall base excess, often fail to unmask the underlying cause of acid-base disorders, the physical-chemical acid-base model provides a more in-depth pathophysiological assessment for clinical judgement of acid-base disorders, in patients with liver diseases. Patients with stable chronic liver disease have several offsetting acidifying and alkalinising metabolic acid-base disorders. Hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis is counteracted by hyperchloraemic and dilutional acidosis, resulting in a normal overall base excess. When patients with liver cirrhosis become critically ill (e.g., because of sepsis or bleeding), this fragile equilibrium often tilts towards metabolic acidosis, which is attributed to lactic acidosis and acidosis due to a rise in unmeasured anions. Interestingly, even though patients with acute liver failure show significantly elevated lactate levels, often, no overt acid-base disorder can be found because of the offsetting hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis. In conclusion, patients with liver diseases may have multiple co-existing metabolic acid-base abnormalities. Thus, knowledge of the pathophysiological and diagnostic concepts of acid-base disturbances in patients with liver disease is critical for therapeutic decision making.

### Renal hypokalemia: an endocrine perspective [^111JKFXX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of disorders that cause renal potassium wasting present with abnormalities in adrenal hormone secretion. While these findings frequently lead patients to seek endocrine evaluation, clinicians often struggle to accurately diagnose these conditions, delaying treatment and adversely impacting patient care. At the same time, growing insight into the genetic and molecular basis of these disorders continues to improve their diagnosis and management. In this review, we outline a practical integrated approach to the evaluation of renal hypokalemia syndromes that are seen in endocrine practice while highlighting recent advances in understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology behind them.

### Acid base disorders in cirrhosis [^114uX2Qa]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders are common in individuals with liver disease and cirrhosis. The most common disorder is respiratory alkalosis, which may be related to dyspnea or respiratory stimulation. Primary metabolic disorders are less common. Although the liver plays a role in metabolism of amino acids and generation of acid from dietary sources, it does not play a role in the regulation of pH. Instead, metabolic disorders may arise from alterations in normal metabolism or from medications, particularly diuretics and osmotic laxatives, used in the treatment of these complex patients. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of these disorders can aid in the management of individuals with liver disease in the hospital and in outpatient settings.

### The AE4 transporter mediates kidney acid-base sensing [^115Bnm4i]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Role of AE4 in the maintenance of acid-base balance

Unexpectedly, Ae4 −/− mice exhibited a perturbation of their acid-base status in the setting of salt-depletion. Here, Ae4 −/− but not wild-type littermates exhibited hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (decreased plasma [Cl ﻿−]) with elevated plasma [HCO 3 ﻿−] (Fig. 1d), and a positive base excess (BE, Supplementary Fig. 3a). This observation prompted us to evaluate whether AE4 was involved in renal acid-base homeostasis. We therefore additionally challenged salt-depleted Ae4 −/− mice and wild-type littermates with dietary alkali-loading (230 mM NaHCO 3, 7 days). This resulted in the development of life-threatening hypochloremic alkalosis in Ae4 −/− mice. Initially, upon 1 day of alkali-loading, both wild-type and Ae4 −/− mice exhibited an increase of blood pH and plasma [HCO 3 ﻿−] together with a slightly decreased plasma [Cl ﻿−]. While wild-type littermates normalized their acid-base status hereafter, Ae4 −/− mice developed a severe hypochloremic alkalosis with a profound secondary respiratory response (increased blood pCO 2) (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 3b). This acid-base disturbance was load-dependent, as Ae4 −/− mice receiving higher amounts of NaHCO 3 exhibited a more severe hypochloremic alkalosis (Supplementary Fig. 3c). In addition, Ae4 −/− mice exhibited a substantial weight loss over the 7-day time course (Supplementary Fig. 3d), accompanied by hypokalemia and decreasing plasma concentrations of the adrenal hormone aldosterone (Fig. 1f). As the release of aldosterone is substantially regulated by plasma [K +], the observed drop of plasma [aldosterone] was the predicted physiologic consequence of the alkalosis-induced hypokalemia in the dietary-challenged Ae4 −/− mice. The severe weight loss was in part due to a reduced food intake (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and a profound volume depletion, as indicated by an increased hematocrit, high plasma renin activity, and renal sodium and water loss in the Ae4 −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3e). The disrupted renal sodium and water handling was most likely the consequence of the derailed physiological status of the Ae4 −/− mice after 7 days of alkali-loading. Alkalosis and hypoaldosteronism decreased the abundance of main sodium reabsorption pathways along the nephron (Supplementary Fig. 3f), whereas hypokalemia impaired the renal ability to concentrate the urine.

### Mixed acid-base disturbances: core curriculum 2025 [^112AErMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in clinical practice and due to their complexity, diagnoses and treatment are challenging. The opposing effects of multiple disturbances can lead to blood pH levels that are near normal or separate acid-base disturbances can have an additive effect leading to more significant changes in blood and intracellular pH. A systematic evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and laboratory results (including acid-base balance, anion gap, electrolytes, and urine parameters) enables the rapid diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders by analyzing the appropriateness of compensatory mechanisms, assessing changes in serum and urine electrolytes, and estimating urinary acid excretion. Eight cases are provided to illustrate the approach to mixed acid-base disturbances. Examples include mixed metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders, mixed respiratory acid-base disorders, and mixed metabolic acid-base disorders.

Since Conn's description of the clinical features associated with primary aldosteronism in 1955, 1 several other cases have been reported in the literature. 2–12 This syndrome, which is the result of hypersecretion by the adrenal gland of the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, is usually due to a functioning adrenocortical adenoma. In the few cases without adenoma, hyperplasia chiefly involving the zona fasciculata has been found, 9 and hyperaldosteronism due to adrenocortical carcinoma with hepatic metastases has been reported. 4 All patients were adults except one girl 6 aged 13, and one boy 12 aged 9 years. The clinical syndrome originally described by Conn 1, 13 consists essentially of polyuria and polydipsia, arterial hypertension, periodic weakness and "paralyses, " paresthesiae, and intermittent tetany.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^114ZQdyr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood Pco2 owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated Hco3- levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

### Pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis… [^11689oWS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The generation of experimental metabolic alkalosis by the kidney was found to require the presence of excess mineralocorticoid hormone and potassium deficiency. Once generated, metabolic alkalosis could be maintained in the absence of excess mineralocorticoid, provided a strong stimulus to proximal reabsorption was present. When proximal reabsorption was not markedly stimulated, metabolic alkalosis was corrected on reduction or discontinuance of mineralocorticoid; under these circumstances correction of potassium deficiency also corrected metabolic alkalosis. The development of metabolic alkalosis by the kidney requires accelerated distal tubular Na for H exchange. This mechanism may also maintain metabolic alkalosis as may increase proximal H+ secretion.
