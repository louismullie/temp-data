## Question

How does antibiotic therapy affect the resolution of OME?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how antibiotic therapy affects the resolution of otitis media with effusion (OME). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and natural history of OME. Then, I should verify the magnitude and certainty of antibiotic benefit from high-quality evidence. Next, I will examine functional outcomes like hearing and quality of life. After that, I need to assess harms and resistance considerations. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and identify any exceptions where antibiotics might be reasonable despite the general recommendation against their use.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and natural history, because if most effusions resolve spontaneously, the bar for treatment benefit is high. OME is fluid in the middle ear without acute inflammatory signs, and spontaneous resolution is common: about 75% resolve by 3 months after AOM, and even when onset is unknown, roughly 28–42% resolve by 3–6 months, with most resolving within a year, which sets a high spontaneous resolution benchmark against which any intervention must be judged [^cf60c42d] [^cb4cf749] [^5370a83e].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of antibiotic benefit from the most authoritative sources. The 2016 Cochrane review of 25 trials (3663 children) found moderate-quality evidence that oral antibiotics increase complete resolution at 2–3 months with a risk ratio around 2.00 and an NNT of about 5, but this benefit is offset by increased adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, or rash with an NNH around 20, and importantly, there was no significant impact on hearing levels or need for tympanostomy tubes, which are the clinically meaningful endpoints [^e74734c2]. The 2023 Cochrane update echoed this, noting only a small, uncertain reduction in persistent OME at 6–12 months and very uncertain effects on hearing, reinforcing that any benefit is modest and not clearly translated into functional gains [^156260fe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about functional outcomes. I should double-check hearing and quality-of-life data. The 2016 Cochrane review found conflicting and low-quality evidence on short-term hearing, with no convincing improvement attributable to antibiotics, and no trials assessed speech, language, or cognitive outcomes, which are the outcomes families care about most [^e74734c2]. The 2023 update similarly found very uncertain effects on return-to-normal hearing, with only one small study suggesting a possible benefit that could easily be due to chance or bias, and again no quality-of-life data, so the clinical relevance of any microbiologic or tympanometric improvement remains doubtful [^156260fe].

> I need to check harms and resistance carefully, because even a small benefit can be outweighed by risks. Across trials, adverse events like gastrointestinal upset and rash are more frequent with antibiotics, with an NNH around 20, and although serious harms are uncommon, the cumulative impact of unnecessary antibiotic exposure is nontrivial at a population level, contributing to resistance and adverse drug reactions without durable patient-centered benefit [^e74734c2]. But wait, what if longer courses change the risk–benefit balance? Even with longer courses, benefits remain small and uncertain, and resistance concerns persist, so the harm signal does not reverse with extended therapy in typical settings [^156260fe].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Multiple high-credibility guidelines issue strong recommendations against routine systemic antibiotics for OME, citing small, short-term benefits that do not translate into improved hearing or reduced surgery, and the preponderance of harm from adverse effects and resistance; this is consistent across AAO-HNSF and AAP guidance and is reflected in the Cochrane conclusions [^192a7842] [^65b94767] [^ae9c32f1]. I should confirm that this applies to otherwise healthy children; yes, the strong recommendation against antibiotics is for typical pediatric OME, with exceptions only when antibiotics are indicated for a coexisting condition such as acute bacterial sinusitis or streptococcal pharyngitis, not for OME itself [^65b94767].

> Let me consider whether there are identifiable subgroups where antibiotics might still be reasonable despite the general recommendation. The clearest exception is high-risk populations with very high rates of tympanic membrane perforation and chronic suppurative otitis media, such as some Aboriginal infants, where randomized trials show that continuous amoxicillin reduces perforations and achieves more normal ears, albeit with uncertain effects on resistance and limited generalizability to low-risk settings; this is a niche scenario and not a basis for routine use in typical children [^c1ec87e9] [^b4f76b2b] [^9b9d638f]. I should also note that these trials did not demonstrate clear hearing or developmental benefits, so even in high-risk groups, the decision should be individualized and contextualized to local epidemiology and access to care [^c1ec87e9].

> I will now examine related evidence to ensure I'm not missing a signal that changes practice. Trials in acute otitis media show that antibiotics shorten symptom duration but do not meaningfully change the time course of middle ear effusion resolution, reinforcing that effusion persistence is driven by noninfectious inflammatory and eustachian tube factors rather than ongoing bacterial infection in most cases of OME [^3b60f391] [^notfound]. This supports the mechanistic plausibility that antibiotics have limited impact on OME resolution in typical children [^3b60f391].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Antibiotics confer a small, short-term increase in the likelihood of effusion resolution at 2–3 months without improving hearing or reducing the need for surgery, and they increase adverse events; therefore, routine antibiotic therapy for OME is not recommended, and watchful waiting with hearing surveillance is the preferred approach for most children, reserving antibiotics for coexisting bacterial indications or for carefully selected high-risk scenarios after shared decision-making [^e74734c2] [^156260fe] [^192a7842] [^65b94767].

---

Antibiotics offer a **modest short-term benefit** for OME resolution, with an absolute risk reduction of about 14–17% at 2–3 months [^e74734c2] and a number needed to treat of 5–7. However, this small benefit **does not translate into improved hearing** [^156260fe] or reduced need for tympanostomy tubes [^e74734c2], and antibiotics increase adverse effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, and rash [^e74734c2]. Given the high rate of spontaneous resolution [^cf60c42d] and the risk of antibiotic resistance, **routine antibiotic use is not recommended** [^192a7842]; reserve antibiotics for select cases with persistent effusion and hearing loss after watchful waiting, or when there is a coexisting bacterial infection [^65b94767].

---

## Clinical evidence on antibiotic efficacy

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews have evaluated antibiotics for OME, with **consistent findings**:

- **Short-term resolution**: Antibiotics increase the likelihood of short-term resolution at 2–3 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.58–2.53; NNT 5) [^e74734c2].
- **Long-term persistence**: No significant benefit beyond 6 months; pooled analysis shows only a 13% absolute risk reduction at > 6 months, with wide confidence intervals [^b7ec4deb].
- **Hearing outcomes**: No consistent improvement in hearing thresholds or quality of life with antibiotics [^156260fe] [^e74734c2].
- **Need for surgery**: Antibiotics do not reduce the need for tympanostomy tubes [^e74734c2] [^65b94767].

---

## Magnitude of benefit

The magnitude of benefit is **small and clinically limited**:

| **Outcome** | **Effect size** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-term resolution (2–3 months) | RR 2.00 (95% CI 1.58–2.53) | Modest; NNT 5 |
| Long-term persistence (> 6 months) | RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.68–1.17) | Minimal; not significant |
| Hearing improvement | No consistent benefit | Not significant |
| Reduction in tympanostomy tubes | No significant reduction | Not significant |

---

## Adverse effects and risks

Antibiotics carry **meaningful risks** that offset their limited benefit:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are more common with antibiotics (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29–3.60; NNH 20) [^e74734c2].
- **Allergic reactions**: Rash and rare anaphylaxis can occur [^e74734c2].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Widespread use drives resistance, a major public health concern [^65b94767] [^b7ec4deb].

---

## Comparison with other interventions

Antibiotics are **inferior to other options** for OME:

- **Watchful waiting**: Spontaneous resolution occurs in ~75% by 3 months [^cf60c42d]; observation is first-line for most children [^af3cd36e].
- **Tympanostomy tubes**: Effective for persistent effusion with hearing loss; superior to antibiotics for hearing improvement and effusion resolution [^notfound].
- **Autoinflation**: Modest benefit in some children, particularly older children who can cooperate [^08a2b9e0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines **recommend against routine antibiotic use** for OME:

- **AAO-HNSF**: Strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics for OME [^192a7842] [^ae9c32f1].
- **AAP**: Recommends against antibiotics for OME, citing limited benefit and potential harms [^65b94767].
- **AAFP**: Advises against antibiotics, emphasizing watchful waiting and selective use only when coexisting bacterial infection is present [^32fb05fa].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

Antibiotics may be considered in **select scenarios**:

- **Persistent effusion**: Bilateral OME persisting ≥ 3 months with documented hearing loss [^4e64a76a].
- **Coexisting infection**: Acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection [^65b94767].
- **High-risk populations**: Children with recurrent AOM, structural ear abnormalities, or significant hearing loss may benefit from individualized decisions [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Antibiotics provide a **modest short-term benefit** for OME resolution but do not improve hearing or reduce surgery, and they carry adverse effects and resistance risks. Routine antibiotic use is not recommended; prioritize watchful waiting and reserve antibiotics for select cases with persistent effusion and hearing loss, or when a bacterial co-infection is present.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. In approximately one in three children with OME, however, a bacterial pathogen is identified in the middle ear fluid. In most cases, OME causes mild hearing impairment of short duration. When experienced in early life and when episodes of (bilateral) OME persist or recur, the associated hearing loss may be significant and have a negative impact on speech development and behaviour. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral and topical intranasal steroids in OME. This review focuses on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 22 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included resolution of OME at other time points, hearing, language and speech, ventilation tube insertion and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms and assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We presented dichotomous results as risk differences as well as risk ratios, with their 95% confidence intervals. If heterogeneity was greater than 75% we did not pool data.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (3027 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points of evaluation. Overall, we assessed the studies as generally being at low risk of bias. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. The differences (improvement) in the proportion of children having such resolution (risk difference (RD)) in the five individual included studies ranged from 1% (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.12; not significant) to 45% (RD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65). Results from these studies could not be pooled due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Pooled analysis of data for complete resolution at more than six months was possible, with an increase in resolution of 13% (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19). Pooled analysis was also possible for complete resolution at the end of treatment, with the following increases in resolution rates: 17% (RD 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24) for treatment for 10 days to two weeks, 34% (RD 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.50) for treatment for four weeks, 32% (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47) for treatment for three months, and 14% (RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.24) for treatment continuously for at least six months. We were unable to find evidence of a substantial improvement in hearing as a result of the use of antibiotics for otitis media with effusion; nor did we find an effect on the rate of ventilation tube insertion. We did not identify any trials that looked at speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Data on the adverse effects of antibiotic treatment reported in six studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. Increases in the occurrence of adverse events varied from 3% (RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.07; not significant) to 33% (RD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.44) in the individual studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review do not support the routine use of antibiotics for children up to 18 years with otitis media with effusion. The largest effects of antibiotics were seen in children treated continuously for four weeks and three months. Even when clear and relevant benefits of antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must be balanced against the potential adverse effects when making treatment decisions. Immediate adverse effects of antibiotics are common and the emergence of bacterial resistance has been causally linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children [^e74734c2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, nasal autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants and corticosteroids in OME. This review, focusing on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME, is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness in children with OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution at two to three months post-randomisation (primary outcome) than those allocated to the control treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 2.53; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 5). However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash (primary outcome) than those allocated to control treatment (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.60; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 20). In respect of the secondary outcome of complete resolution at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five meta-analyses, including between two and 14 trials, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from 3 to 7. Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months. In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results. None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with a decrease in the rate of ventilation tube insertion (two trials, 121 children) or in tympanic membrane sequelae (one trial, 103 children), while low quality evidence indicated that children treated with antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months post-randomisation (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should, however, be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when we excluded studies with high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review presents evidence of both benefits and harms associated with the use of oral antibiotics to treat children up to 16 years with OME. Although evidence indicates that oral antibiotics are associated with an increased chance of complete resolution of OME at various time points, we also found evidence that these children are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash. The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions. Furthermore, we found no data on the impact of antibiotics on other important outcomes such as speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Even in situations where clear and relevant benefits of oral antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must always be carefully balanced against adverse effects and the emergence of bacterial resistance. This has specifically been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

### Otitis media with effusion in children [^5370a83e]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of children have been affected by otitis media with effusion (OME) by the age of 4 years, but prevalence declines beyond 6 years of age. Non-purulent middle-ear infections can occur in children or adults after upper respiratory tract infection or acute otitis media. Half or more of cases resolve within 3 months and 95% within a year, but complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea, and cholesteatoma can occur.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent OME; and of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical interventions to treat OME? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adenoidectomy, antibiotics, antihistamines, autoinflation, bottle feeding, decongestants, exposure to other children, intranasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, oral corticosteroids, passive smoking, ventilation tubes.

### Natural history of untreated otitis media [^cb4cf749]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Data from cohort studies and untreated groups in randomized controlled trials can be identified through systematic literature review and synthesized with meta-analysis to estimate natural history of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME).

Study Design

Systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

Method

Source articles were identified by MEDLINE search through August 2002 plus manual crosschecks of bibliographies and published meta-analyses. Data were abstracted independently by two investigators and combined with random effects meta-analysis to estimate spontaneous resolution, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was performed.

Results

Sixty-three articles met inclusion criteria. AOM symptoms improved within 24 hours without antibiotics in 61% of children (95% CI, 50–72%), rising to 80% by 2 to 3 days (95% CI, 69–90%). Suppurative complications were comparable if antibiotics were withheld (0.12%) or provided (0.24%). Children entered recurrent AOM trials with a mean rate of 5.5 or more annual episodes but averaged only 2.8 annual episodes while on placebo (95% CI, 2.2–3.4). No AOM episodes occurred in 41%, and only 17% remained otitis prone (3 or more episodes). OME after untreated AOM had 59% resolution by 1 month (95% CI, 50–68%) and 74% resolution by 3 months (95% CI, 68–80%). OME of unknown duration had 28% spontaneous resolution by 3 months (95%, CI 14–41%), rising to 42% by 6 months (95% CI, 35–49%). In contrast, chronic OME had only 26% resolution by 6 months and 33% resolution by 1 year.

Conclusions

The natural history of otitis media is very favorable. Combined estimates of spontaneous resolution provide a benchmark against which to judge new or established interventions. The need for surgery in children with recurrent AOM or chronic OME should be balanced against the likelihood of timely spontaneous resolution and the potential risk of learning, language, or other adverse sequelae from persistent middle ear effusion. Further research is needed to identify prognostic factors that can target children unlikely to improve spontaneously for earlier intervention.

### Effect of antimicrobial treatment on the resolution of middle-ear effusion after acute otitis media [^3b60f391]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) induces middle-ear effusion (MEE), which affects hearing. The effect of antimicrobial treatment on the resolution of MEE is controversial, and the factors that affect resolution are unknown.

Methods

We studied the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the time to the resolution of MEE as a secondary objective in our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Children aged 6 to 35 months with stringently diagnosed AOM were allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 patients) or placebo (158 patients) for 7 days and closely followed for 3 months. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT00299455).

Results

The median times to resolution of MEE were 20 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 16–24 days) and 29 days (95% CI, 26–32 days) in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.10). The resolution of MEE was confirmed in 138 (86%) of 161 and 132 (84%) of 158 patients in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.59). In multivariable analysis, the resolution of MEE was prolonged most significantly by at least 1 recurrence of AOM during follow-up. MEE resolved in 65 (65%) of 100 patients with a recurrence of AOM during follow-up and in 205 (94%) of 219 of those without a recurrence (P < .001) (median times to resolution, 67 vs 15 days, respectively; P < .001).

Conclusions

Immediate antimicrobial treatment of AOM does not significantly affect the resolution of MEE in young children. Subsequent recurrences of AOM are a major reason for the persistence of MEE.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children [^b59fc9b7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a quarterly section in the journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to aid clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane Review, "Antibiotics for Otitis Media with Effusion in Children", that does not support the routine use of antibiotics for treating otitis media with effusion in children. Although children treated with antibiotics had higher rates of effusion resolution, there was no impact on hearing levels or the need for tympanostomy tubes.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^156260fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat any bacteria present in the effusion, or associated biofilms.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies to 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared oral antibiotics with either placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life and 3) anaphylaxis. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 19 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (2581 participants). They assessed a variety of oral antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides and trimethoprim), with most studies using a 10- to 14-day treatment course. We had some concerns about the risk of bias in all studies included in this review. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up time. Antibiotics versus placebo We included 11 studies for this comparison, but none reported all of our outcomes of interest and limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that more children may return to normal hearing by two months (resolution of the air-bone gap) after receiving antibiotics as compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.51 to 26.18; 20/49 children who received antibiotics returned to normal hearing versus 0/37 who received placebo; 1 study, 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME At 6 to 12 months of follow-up, the use of antibiotics compared with placebo may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent OME, but the confidence intervals were wide, and the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.17; 48% versus 54%; number needed to treat (NNT) 17; 2 studies, 324 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Three of the included studies (448 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics versus no treatment We included eight studies for this comparison, but very limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may result in little to no difference in final hearing threshold at three months (mean difference (MD) -5.38 dB HL, 95% CI -9.12 to -1.64; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). The only data identified on the return to normal hearing were reported at 10 days of follow-up, which we considered to be too short to accurately reflect the efficacy of antibiotics. Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME Antibiotics may reduce the proportion of children who have persistent OME at up to three months of follow-up, when compared with no treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; 6 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Two of the included studies (180 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the use of antibiotics for OME is of low to very low certainty. Although the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may have a slight beneficial effect on the resolution of OME at up to three months, the overall impact on hearing is very uncertain. The long-term effects of antibiotics are unclear and few of the studies included in this review reported on potential harms. These important endpoints should be considered when weighing up the potential short- and long-term benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment in a condition with a high spontaneous resolution rate.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^1407bb60]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion found no benefit from intranasal steroids. However, the review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, risk ratio 1.99 [95% CI 1.14–3.49] for persistent otitis media with effusion at follow-up), and a non-significant point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, risk ratio 3.80 [95% CI 0.93–15.52]). Oral antibiotics alone were not effective.

Studies included in the systematic review were limited by short-term follow-up, low power, poorly described inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No previous cost-effectiveness studies of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. A non-placebo-controlled trial published subsequent to the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.

Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. We included more patients than the combined total number of participants included in previous studies of oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included hearing, tympanometric, and quality-of-life assessments at follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, language, and other functional outcomes compared with watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.

An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months. We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.

ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS A Cochrane review of three RCTs that included 108 children six months to 15 years of age found that oral corticosteroids in varying types and dosages improved OME for the first month of therapy. 1 One study of 44 children found no improvement in hearing in those receiving oral corticosteroids compared with the placebo group. 2 Five RCTs that included 409 children found that oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics improved rates of OME resolution at less than one month compared with placebo plus an antibiotic. NASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroids have not demonstrated short- or long-term benefits in the resolution of OME or improvement in hearing.

One study of 200 children randomized to daily mometasone or placebo found no difference in the number of days with hearing loss after three months of therapy. 4 After nine months of follow-up, there was still no benefit in the treatment group. A three-week study of 44 children randomized to placebo or dexamethasone nasal spray found no difference in resolution of OME, but did not evaluate hearing. 5 One RCT evaluating beclomethasone plus amoxicillin vs. placebo plus amoxicillin in 53 children found no benefit in resolution of OME in the group that received corticosteroids.
6. An RCT including 91 participants with OME found that triamcinolone nasal spray was no better than placebo for improving tympanometry findings or symptoms such as deafness and blocked or popping ears.

7 Analysis of a subgroup of children found a similar lack of effectiveness.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^db02ce6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To examine the evidence for treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 26 August 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an oral antibiotic. We excluded publications in abstract form only; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; and studies reporting outcomes by ears (rather than children).

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently extracted data from the published reports using standardised data extraction forms and methods. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We expressed dichotomous results as a risk ratio (RR) and continuous data as weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where feasible we pooled studies using a random-effects model and performed tests for heterogeneity between studies. In trials with a cross-over design, we did not use post cross-over treatment data.

Main Results

We included 12 medium to high-quality studies with a total of 945 participants. No study documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. The follow-up period was generally limited, with only one study of intranasal steroid reporting outcome data beyond six months. There was no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of hearing loss associated with OME. Pooled data using a fixed-effect model for OME resolution at short-term follow up (< 1 month) showed a significant effect of oral steroids compared to control (RR 4.48; 95% CI 1.52 to 13.23; Chi² 2.75, df = 2, P = 0.25; I² = 27%). Oral steroids plus antibiotic also resulted in an improvement in OME resolution compared to placebo plus antibiotic at less than one month follow up, using a random-effects model (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.49; five trials, 409 children). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.01, I² = 69%). There was no evidence of beneficial effect on OME resolution at greater than one month follow up with oral steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) or intranasal steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) at any follow-up period. There was also no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

While oral steroids, especially when used in combination with an oral antibiotic, lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term, there is no evidence of longer-term benefit and no evidence that they relieve symptoms of hearing loss. We found no evidence of benefit from treatment of OME with topical intranasal steroids, alone or in combination with an antibiotic, either at short or longer-term follow up.

Conclusion

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

Discussion

We have studied OM in Aboriginal communities where almost all children have persistent middle ear disease from an early age; nevertheless, our results could also be relevant for other high-risk groups. The primary outcome from our double-blind RCT is that amoxicillin significantly increased the proportion of children achieving normal middle ears (bilaterally aerated) at consecutive monthly examinations. Amoxicillin also reduced the proportion of children with any perforation. The proportion with any suppurative OM was also less in the amoxicillin group at the end of therapy, but not significantly so (Table 2). The proportion of children on amoxicillin experiencing at least two episodes of AOMwiP during therapy was less than for placebo children (4% versus 18%, respectively). There was no difference between placebo and amoxicillin in the proportion of children with OME (~52% in each group) or AOMwoP (~22%) at the end of therapy. Risk differences during therapy (supplementary material) were consistent with the end of therapy findings. Pneumococcal non-susceptibility was similar in amoxicillin and placebo groups, however a greater proportion of children in the amoxicillin group were colonised by beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae at both baseline and at end of therapy.

Our findings can be understood in terms of the natural history of OM in high-risk populations. In Aboriginal children, AOM is usually asymptomatic with parents unaware that their child is unwell. In community-based screening, some 20% to 30% of Aboriginal children have bulging eardrums. Only a minority have the typical symptoms (sudden onset of middle ear effusion with pain or fever) which define AOM in low-risk populations. To explain our findings in this high-risk population, we suggest that in placebo recipients, asymptomatic middle ear infection often progresses to AOM with perforation, whereas continuous amoxicillin helps to prevent that progression. This is consistent with our previous study of short-term antibiotics for asymptomatic AOM which indicated that the majority of children still satisfy the criteria for AOM despite treatment for 7 to 14 days. The present study suggests that therapy can be more successful if it is maintained long-term. We believe that this can be explained by the association of bacterial load with increased severity of OM. It may be that continuous antibiotics maintain bacterial load below a critical threshold for more severe disease.

Methods

Aims

To compare the effects of long-term antibiotics and placebo on otitis media with effusion (OME) and nasopharyngeal carriage of antibiotic-resistant OM bacterial pathogens in a high-risk population.

Participants and Setting

The study was conducted in three Aboriginal communities located 70 Km from Darwin, in tropical northern Australia. During the study period breastfeeding was universal, parental smoking extremely common, and formal childcare was unavailable. Data collection commenced in 1996 and was completed in 2001, when pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was about to be licensed in Australia.

Eligibility and exclusion criteria

Enrolled infants were Aboriginal, less than 12 months of age and resident in a study community. Infants were enrolled as soon as possible after birth, examined every two weeks, and those with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) were eligible for randomization. Infants were excluded on the basis of prematurity (< 34 weeks), chronic infection requiring prophylactic antibiotic therapy, craniofacial abnormalities or immune deficiency syndromes.

Ethical and Funding Issues

The study was approved by the Top End Human Research Ethics Committee and Aboriginal Sub-Committee, and the Tiwi Health Board. Funding was provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council, which had no involvement in study design, management, or reporting of results.

Consent procedures

Written informed consent was sought before enrolment and also before randomization; families were given at least 2 weeks to consider consent. Initially, consent for microbiological assessments prior to randomisation was not requested.

Randomised Intervention

Randomized participants received either amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day bid) or placebo equivalent volume for 24 weeks or until bilateral normal middle ear status was detected at two consecutive monthly examinations (success). Block randomisation was stratified by age. Allocation was concealed from children, family, investigators, and those providing routine clinical care. Blinding was achieved by using a placebo similar in packaging, colour, consistency and smell to amoxicillin suspension. Intercurrent illnesses were managed according to local community treatment guidelines.

Diagnosis and Outcome assessments

Eligibility and scheduling

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrolment to randomization, and monthly over the 24 week intervention period or until success was documented.

Assessments

At each study visit a paediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomisation visit, and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Criteria for otitis media categories (Table 1)

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria and severity scale for worse ear

Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorised as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

Success

The primary outcome ('success'), was detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

Statistical power and methods

We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate (5% to 25%). This would also give 88% power to detect a 30% reduction in perforation at the end of therapy (60% to 30%). Interim analysis and stopping rule was intended to be applied if the success rate in the active arm was 40%.

Data were analysed according to a pre-determined plan. We used the outcome in the worse ear (the ear with the highest severity score) to avoid dependence between ears. Estimates of treatment effect are given as the difference between amoxicillin and placebo groups in the prevalence of each outcome at the end of therapy, as a difference in the proportion of examinations during therapy (risk difference and unadjusted 95% confidence interval) or as a adjusted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (adjusted for repeat child examinations using generalised linear models – Poisson). For children who failed to complete therapy, the last available assessment was used. Two sided significance tests were used throughout. All calculations used Stata version 9.

### Does early detection of otitis media with effusion prevent delayed language development? [^b19663f4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To consider whether earlier detection of otitis media with effusion (OME) in asymptomatic children in the first 4 years of life prevents delayed language development.

Methods

MEDLINE and other databases were searched and relevant references from articles reviewed. Critical appraisal and consensus development were in accordance with the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.

Results

No randomised controlled trials assessing the overall screening for OME and early intervention to prevent delay in acquiring language were identified, although one trial evaluated treatment in a screened population and found no benefit. The "analytic pathway" approach was therefore used, where evidence is evaluated for individual steps in a screening process. The evidence supporting the use of tools for early detection such as tympanometry, microtympanometry, acoustic reflectometry, and pneumatic otoscopy in the first 4 years of life is unclear. Some treatments (mucolytics, antibiotics, steroids) resulted in the short term resolution of effusions as measured by tympanometry. Ventilation tubes resolved effusions and improved hearing. Ventilation tubes in children with hearing loss associated with OME benefited children in the short term, but after 18 months there was no difference in comparison with those assigned to watchful waiting. Most prospective cohort studies that evaluated the association between OME and language development lacked adequate measurement of exposure or outcome, or suffered from attrition bias. Findings with regard to the association were inconsistent.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support attempts at early detection of OME in the first 4 years of life in the asymptomatic child to prevent delayed language development.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^39ac2aa0]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

Ear Assessments during therapy [see Additional Files 3 and 4]

Bilaterally normal ears were seen at least once in 11 (21%) amoxicillin infants and 5 (10%) placebo infants. More children in the amoxicillin group had at least one diagnosis of OME and more had AOMwoP. Fewer amoxicillin children had AOMwiP detected (25% and 33%, respectively), and recurrent AOMwiP was identified in significantly fewer amoxicillin children (4%) and than placebo children (18%) (RD = -14% [-25, -2]).

Results were similar when expressed as a proportion of examinations for each group. Bilateral normal ears were detected in 6% and 2% of visits in amoxicillin and placebo infants, respectively (adjusted risk ratio = 2.7 [0.78, 9.13] p = 0.116). OME was the worst ear diagnosis at about half the visits in each group, AOMwoP was detected in about one quarter of visits. AOMwiP was less often diagnosed in children receiving amoxicillin (8%) than placebo (19%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.36 [0.16, 0.84] p = 0.017). For combined diagnostic categories of any suppurative OM, any perforation, and any active perforation, significant differences in perforation were found. Antibiotic prescribing for a clinical indication was less often required at examinations of amoxicillin children (55%) then placebo children (68%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.67 [0.36, 1.22] p = 0.190). Tables S2a and S2b give more detail of ear status over the course of the trial [see Additional files 3 and 4].

Nasopharyngeal outcomes at the end of therapy (Table 2)

At the end of therapy, carriage of OM pathogens, and carriage of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (34% in amoxicillin group and 40% in placebo group) was not significantly different between groups.

Results

Participants [see Additional File 1]

From 188 births in the study period, family consent was obtained to enrol 126 infants. 103 were randomised (Figure 1). Details of non-randomised infants and of those who discontinued amoxicillin (n = 2) or placebo (n = 7).

≸AOMwoP, AOMwiP or CSOM;

≹AOMwiP, dry perforation or CSOM

In the period from birth to randomisation, diagnoses of OM or respiratory illnesses other than OM, and antibiotic use (oral or IM) had been documented by clinic staff for more than half the children in each group (data not shown). All children were less than 12 months of age at enrolment. There were 321 examinations by study staff between enrolment and randomisation; bilateral normal ears were diagnosed in 12% of examinations, OME in about 50%, AOM in 26%, and perforations in less than 10%.

52 infants were allocated to amoxicillin and 51 to placebo, and the groups were similar for mean age of mothers, mean infant gestational age, proportion male, number of study visits before randomisation, age at randomisation, and distribution of ear-states prior to randomisation. Mean birth weight was significantly greater for placebo infants (p = 0.0013).

Ear states at randomisation

At randomisation 50 (96%) of amoxicillin infants and 49 (96%) of placebo infants had OME as the worst ear diagnosis; 3 infants had resolving AOM and started the intervention study after an additional week of antibiotic treatment; one infant (placebo) had unilateral dry perforation.

Nasopharyngeal carriage at randomisation [see Additional File 2]

On the day of randomisation, carriage of each respiratory bacterial pathogen was high in both groups (between 73% and 81%). All three OM bacterial pathogens were carried by half of the children in each group (54% and 53% respectively); penicillin non-susceptible (MIC > 0.1 μg.ml) pneumococci were carried by 27% and 37% in amoxicillin and placebo groups, respectively. Beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae were detected in 6% and 2% of children respectively. None of these differences reached statistical significance.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^2789b525]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

What are the microbiological implications of long-term amoxicillin? Our study shows a significant reduction in pneumococcal carriage during amoxicillin therapy. Despite the positive results from our RCT it is unclear whether withholding antibiotics in an asymptomatic child at risk of perforation will result in a clinical deterioration that outweighs the theoretical risk of increasing antibiotic resistance should the child be treated. It is reassuring that in our RCT there was no increase in the carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci as a result of treatment, nor any difference in antibiotics prescribed for intercurrent illnesses between amoxicillin and placebo children. Indeed there was a tendency for fewer children in the amoxicillin group to be colonised by penicillin-resistant pneumococci. On the other hand, although beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae were uncommon in both groups, they were detected more frequently in children receiving amoxicillin; however, as this non-significant trend was also present before the start of trial therapy, it could be a chance finding.

Empirical studies of resistance are not available from other randomised controlled trials of long term antibiotics for otitis media. The study of perforation in Alaska natives, which also found that long-term antibiotics were beneficial, did not report on antibiotic resistance. We note that by 1997, 25% of Australian clinical isolates were penicillin non-susceptible, and high levels of penicillin resistance were reported from Aboriginal communities from the mid 1980s.

We have previously shown that OM is more advanced when multiple pathogens colonise the nasopharynx simultaneously and at high density We suggest that the effect of long-term amoxicillin is to reduce the density and multiplicity of bacterial carriage by reducing the rate of acquisition of new strains and/or the rate of proliferation of those already acquired. In the Finnish OM study 28% of new pneumococcal acquisitions were associated with pneumococcal AOM, compared with only 11% for established carriage.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^f5edc63e]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Otitis media with effusion causes substantial problems for patients and their families, and results in considerable costs to the NHS. It continues to be the most common reason for childhood surgery despite reported reductions in the number of ventilation operations. The McKinsey report commissioned by the Department of Health states that the NHS could save £21 million per year by reducing insertion of ventilation tubes by a further 90%, a procedure that they assessed as being "relatively ineffective". The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline published in 2008 for management of otitis media with effusion recommends a "watchful waiting" period of 3 months, with referral to an ENT department if hearing is significantly affected, if the condition persists for longer than 3 months, or if there is suspected language or developmental delay.US guidelines also recommend watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis. Oral steroids might be a reasonable candidate intervention to help reduce the burden of otitis media with effusion. However, our findings suggest that any hearing-related benefit from oral steroids is likely to occur in one in 14 children (aged 2–8 years) with otitis media with effusion, and that this benefit might be of questionable clinical significance, since we found no evidence of a beneficial effect on functional health status and health-related quality of life. Therefore, based on these findings we do not recommend routine use of oral steroids in this setting.

The high rate of spontaneous resolution identified in this study will support the evidence base informing discussions about watchful waiting in children with hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.

Given the findings of some benefit from antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children, and limited trial evidence for a benefit from oral steroids in combination with antibiotics, a rigorous trial of oral steroids combined with antibiotics might be indicated.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^9650bc48]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) vs otitis media with effusion (OME) — clinical distinction and antibiotic stewardship: OME may occur either after an episode of AOM or from eustachian tube dysfunction related to an upper respiratory tract infection and may also precede and predispose to AOM; because OME does not represent an acute infectious process that benefits from antibiotics, clinicians should become proficient in distinguishing normal middle ear status from OME or AOM to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, adverse effects, and antimicrobial resistance.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^231dcb6a]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media (OM) is an important health problem in young children. In most settings the pain or fever of acute OM (AOM) is of principal concern. However, in disadvantaged and Indigenous populations, where symptomatic AOM is less often reported, AOM with tympanic membrane perforation (AOMwiP) and progression to chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) can lead to hearing impairment and educational disadvantage. CSOM is estimated to currently affect between 65 and 330 million people, 60% of whom have a significant hearing loss This global burden mainly affects South East Asia, Western Pacific, Africa and ethnic minorities. A 2001 cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal children aged 6 months to 2.5 years living in 29 remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory of Australia, showed perforation rates varying from 0% to 60% (mean rate 24%) between communities. In longitudinal studies of Aboriginal children, OM has been shown to commence within weeks of birth, shortly after nasopharyngeal colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-capsular Haemophilus influenzae (NCHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis. This link between bacterial colonisation and early onset of persistent OM suggested to us that long-term antibiotic therapy could be of benefit for Aboriginal infants and others in high-risk populations. The impact of antibiotics has been unclear in populations where rates of CSOM exceed 4%, although systematic reviews demonstrate that antibiotics do prevent some episodes of AOM in more affluent populations, and are particularly beneficial for children with more severe OM.

We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss.

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^c1ec87e9]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

For children at high risk of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), strategies to prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) may reduce progression to CSOM.

Methods

In a double blind study in northern Australia, 103 Aboriginal infants with first detection of OME were randomised to receive either amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d BD) or placebo for 24 weeks, or until bilateral aerated middle ears were diagnosed at two successive monthly examinations (success). Standardised clinical assessments and international standards for microbiology were used.

Results

Five of 52 infants in the amoxicillin group and none of 51 infants in the placebo group achieved success at the end of therapy (Risk Difference = 9.6% [95% confidence interval 1.6,17.6]). Amoxicillin significantly reduced the proportion of children with i) perforation at the end of therapy (27% to 12% RD = -16% [-31,-1]), ii) recurrent perforation during therapy (18% to 4% RD = -14% [-25,-2]), and iii) reduced the proportion of examinations with a diagnosis of perforation during therapy (20% to 8% adjusted risk ratio 0.36 [0.15,0.83] p = 0.017). During therapy, the proportion of examinations with penicillin non-susceptible (MIC > 0.1 microg/ml) pneumococci was not significantly different between the amoxicillin group (34%) and the placebo group (40%). Beta-lactamase positive non-capsular H. influenzae (NCHi) were uncommon during therapy but more frequent in the amoxicillin group (10%) than placebo (5%).

Conclusion

Aboriginal infants receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations, and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^7e07bdba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial. The effectiveness of both systemic and topical intranasal steroids in promoting the resolution of effusions has been assessed by randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To examine evidence for or against treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

Searches were conducted in January 2002. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms 'otitis media', 'otitis media with effusion', 'glue ear', or 'OME', and 'steroids', 'glucocorticoids, synthetic', 'glucocorticoids, topical', 'anti-inflammatory agents, steroidal' EMBASE and MEDLINE were also searched for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an antibiotic, were included.

Exclusions

publications in abstract form only since adequate appraisal was not possible; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; studies reporting outcomes with ears (rather than children) as the unit of analysis unless data were of sufficient detail to allow analysis by child.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the published reports by the two authors independently (CCB and JH van der V) using standardised data extraction forms and methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by the two authors using the scheme described in the Cochrane Handbook. Dichotomous results were expressed as an odds ratio using a fixed effects model together with the 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data were analysed using the weighted mean difference in a fixed effects model. Tests for heterogeneity between studies were performed using a Mantel-Haenszel approach. In trials with a cross over design, post crossover treatment data were not used.

Main Results

No study prospectively documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. Follow up was mainly short term. No serious or lasting adverse effects were reported in the six studies that did mention adverse effects. Most comparisons involved small numbers of subjects. The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up in children treated with oral steroids compared to control was 0.22 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up for children treated with oral steroids plus antibiotic compared to control plus antibiotic was 0.32 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.52). However there was significant heterogeneity between studies included in the latter comparison (p < 0.01). Trends favoured steroids for most other comparisons, but confidence intervals included unity. There was no evidence of benefit for steroid treatment for resolution of OME or of resolution of hearing loss associated with OME in the longer term.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Both oral and topical intranasal steroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term. However, there is no evidence of a long term benefit from treating OME effusions or associated hearing loss with either oral or topical intranasal steroids. No serious adverse events were reported in the six studies that presented data on adverse effects. Future studies should document hearing loss associated with OME before the start of study treatment. Follow up should be longer and ideally include health related quality of life and hearing assessments. Data should not be presented only with ears as the unit of analysis.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^3c25d4f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

Nasopharyngeal outcomes during therapy [see Additional Files 3 and 4]

Over the course of the RCT, fewer amoxicillin swabs (59%) than placebo swabs (78%) were positive for pneumococcus (adjusted risk ratio = 0.77 [0.67, 0.88] p = 0.000). Recovery of NCHi was ~70% in each group. There were non-significant differences in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes (42% versus 48% in amoxicillin and placebo swabs, respectively, data not shown) and M. catarrhalis (85% versus 90%). Fewer amoxicillin swabs cultured all 3 pathogens simultaneously (46% versus 58%), but this was not statistically significant (adjusted risk ratio = 0.64 [0.34, 1.23] p = 0.183). During therapy, children in the amoxicillin group also carried fewer penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (34% versus 40% in amoxicillin and placebo, respectively), and fewer macrolide non-susceptible (16% versus 20%, data not shown) and multi-drug resistant (15% versus 20%, data not shown) pneumococci. Beta-lactamase producing NCHi were detected more often in amoxicillin (10%) than placebo (5%) swabs; these latter differences did not reach statistical significance. Tables S2b and S3b give more detail of carriage status over the course of the trial [see Additional Files 3 and 4].

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^adf0cd41]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Screening children in the first four years of life to undergo early treatment for otitis media with effusion [^38e07afc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. This condition has a prevalence of about 20% at the age of two years, a time of rapid language development. It is most often asymptomatic. Effective treatment exists for clearing effusions. Some have argued, therefore, that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. However, there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of effusions and for some children, effusions may represent a physiological response that does not reduce hearing significantly or impact negatively on language development or behaviour. Previous reviews of the effect of screening and treatment have included studies using non-randomised designs.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effectiveness, on language and behavioural outcomes, of screening and treating children with clinically important OME in the first four years of their life. The focus was on the first four years of life because this is the time of most rapid language development. The consequences of hearing loss are likely to be most serious during this time. In addition, children of this age are least likely to be able to report or seek help for impaired hearing, particularly if these problems have a slow onset and are subtle.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (the Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966–2002) and EMBASE (1974–2002) (all in February 2002) and reference lists of all studies. We also contacted the first authors of the studies we included in this review.

Selection Criteria

1. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening. 2. Comparison of outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME and outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We identified no trials comparing outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME with outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME. We identified three trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening. From these trials, we found no evidence of clinically important benefit in language development from screening and treating children with clinically important OME. Although there was a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME and improved hearing in the short-term (six months), this effect largely disappeared in the long-term (12 months).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The identified randomised trials do not show an important benefit from screening of the general population of asymptomatic children in the first four years of life for OME on language development and behaviour.

Chronic OME — natural history and predictors of persistence: The natural history of OME is favorable and intervention is usually unnecessary even if OME persists for > 3 months, but the longer the effusion is present the more the rate of resolution decreases and relapse becomes more common; risk factors associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous resolution include onset of OME in summer or fall season, history of prior tympanostomy tubes, and not having a prior adenoidectomy.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^cc7658c0]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^89272e76]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion is estimated to affect 50–80% of children by the age of 5 years and costs the National Health Service (NHS) up to £90 million per year. Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and mucolytics are ineffective treatments for this condition. Intervention options are largely limited to watchful waiting, hearing aids, or surgical insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic membrane (with or without adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy). Use of an autoinflation device resulted in a modest benefit for some children aged 4–11 years. However, 80% of children are affected by otitis media with effusion before the age of 4 years, a time when language development is most rapid, hearing loss has its greatest effect on language development, and when children are generally unable to use an autoinflation device. Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but children often find them uncomfortable, might feel self-conscious, and can become a target for bullying. Both hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary care, with major cost implications. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment, especially if implementable in primary care, would enhance treatment options.

Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). A subsequent trial found that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation and the American Academy of Pediatrics, informed by the generally underpowered studies in our review, have recommended against oral steroids for otitis media with effusion. Despite this recommendation, adults diagnosed with otitis media with effusion are more likely to be prescribed oral steroids than those with other diagnoses.

### Otitis media [^5260810e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion, updated in 2011, found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus control with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). We searched PubMed on Jan 22, 2018, and identified an additional trial showing that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but that this advantage disappeared by 3 months.

Added value of this study

This study is, to our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the primary outcome. We achieved good long-term follow-up and found weak evidence of a small benefit in achieving acceptable hearing but no effect on quality-of-life measures from a short course of oral prednisolone in children with persistent otitis media with effusion. In children with documented hearing loss and symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months, the rate of spontaneous resolution is high.

Implications of all the available evidence

Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will be supported by this evidence of the effectiveness and clinical course of oral steroids. We do not recommend routine use of a short course of oral steroids for treatment of hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion.

We therefore aimed to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a short course of oral prednisolone (steroid) on hearing over a short-term period in children with bilateral otitis media with effusion.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^7e05fce6]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Identification of children in the first four years of life for early treatment for otitis media with effusion [^5b93b2f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. This condition has a point-prevalence of about 20% at the age of two years, a time of rapid language development. It is most often asymptomatic. Effective treatment exists for clearing effusions. Some have argued, therefore, that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. However, there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of effusions and, for some children, effusions may represent a physiological response that does not reduce hearing significantly or impact negatively on language development or behaviour. Previous reviews of the effect of screening and treatment have included studies using non-randomised designs.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effect, on language and behavioural outcomes, of screening and treating children with clinically important OME in the first four years of their life. The focus was on the first four years of life because this is the time of most rapid language development. The consequences of hearing loss are likely to be most serious during this time. In addition, children of this age are least likely to be able to report or seek help for impaired hearing, particularly if these problems have a slow onset and are subtle.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006) and EMBASE (1974 to 2006) in February 2002, and again in January 2006, and the reference lists of all studies. We also contacted the first authors of the studies we included in the original review.

Selection Criteria

1. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening.2. Comparison of outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME and outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, two in the original review and two for the update.

Main Results

We identified no trials comparing outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME with outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME. We identified three trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening, one of which generated three published studies. These were trials of treatment in children identified through screening rather than trials of treatment programs. From these trials, we found no evidence of clinically important benefit in language development from screening and treating children with clinically important OME.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified randomised trials do not show an important benefit on language development and behaviour from screening of the general population of asymptomatic children in the first four years of life for OME. However, these trials were all conducted in developed countries. Evidence generated in the developed world, where children may enjoy better nutrition, better living conditions and less severe and different infections may not be applicable to children in developing countries. The screening aspect of some of these studies was aimed primarily at identifying suitable children in whom to evaluate the effects of treatment, rather than to evaluate the effects of screening programs. Younger children and children with milder disease may have been included in these treatment trials compared to children who are offered treatment in pragmatic settings.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) research needs — watchful waiting: Priorities include defining the anticipated rate of spontaneous resolution of OME in infants and young children (existing data are limited primarily to children aged ≥ 2 years), conducting large-scale prospective cohort studies to obtain current data on spontaneous resolution of newly diagnosed OME of unknown prior duration (existing data are primarily from the late 1970s and early 1980s), developing prognostic indicators to identify the best candidates for watchful waiting, determining whether children with an OME duration exceeding 1 to 2 years have an increased risk of hearing loss, balance problems, discomfort, or other findings that would prompt intervention, and determining if the lack of impact from prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes on speech and language outcomes seen in asymptomatic young children with OME can be generalized to older or symptomatic children with OME referred for evaluation.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) patient management and follow-up — ear fluid is a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the ear drum without symptoms of infection, and fluid often goes away on its own, so your doctor will often recommend watchful waiting for the first 3 mo; it is most likely to go away quickly if it has been there < 3 mo or has a known start time, while it is much more likely to persist when it has been there for at least 3 mo or when the start date is unknown. Home measures include keeping the child away from secondhand smoke and, if the child is > 12 mo and still uses a pacifier, stopping the pacifier in the daytime may help the fluid go away. Medical treatment does not work well; you should not give your child antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants, steroids (by mouth or in the nose), or drugs to reduce acid reflux, and no benefits have ever been shown for chiropractic therapy, special diets, herbal remedies, complementary medicine, or alternative (natural) therapies. Ongoing monitoring is advised — the best way to prevent problems is to see the doctor every 3 to 6 mo until the fluid goes away. The fluid cannot directly turn into an ear infection, but during a cold it increases a child's risk of getting an ear infection.

Otitis media with effusion — economic burden and medical therapy evidence indicates substantial costs and limited benefits of common medications. Direct costs related to otitis media, which includes OME and acute otitis media (AOM), are S3 billion to S5 billion annually, and studies report that the indirect cost of lost caregiver productivity may far exceed direct medical costs; the estimated net cost of impaired well-being from otitis media is S1.1 billion to S2.6 billion. Regarding medical therapy, antibiotics have short-term efficacy but long-term use cannot be justified because of concerns over adverse events and induced bacterial resistance, the limited evidence regarding antireflux therapy does not show significant benefits, and there are no benefits to routinely treating with antihistamines, decongestants, or steroids (systemic or topical intranasal).

Otitis media with effusion — evaluation and surveillance of at-risk children When OME is detected in an at-risk child, tympanostomy tubes should be offered when the likelihood of spontaneous resolution is low (eg, type B tympanogram or persistence for ≥ 3 months). For children who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, follow-up to monitor OME and hearing levels may be more frequent than the 3- to 6-month interval recommended later in the guideline, and children should be monitored until OME resolves in all affected ears. Minimum surveillance includes evaluation for OME when a child is first diagnosed as being at risk and again between 12 and 18 months, while ideal practice would entail surveillance every 3 to 6 months for the presence of OME or hearing loss. The guideline recommends assessing for OME at 12 to 18 months of age; by 18 months of age, language and speech delays are easily discerned, and delays beyond 2.5 years of age negatively affect performance in school.

### Effect of antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media on the daily disappearance of middle ear effusion: a placebo-controlled trial [^89f2a40f]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Antimicrobial treatment reduces the symptoms of acute otitis media (AOM). The effect of antimicrobial treatment on the duration of middle ear effusion (MEE) and concomitant hearing impairment is not known.

Objective

To determine whether the antimicrobial treatment of AOM reduces the duration of MEE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved a total of 84 children with AOM between 6 months and 15 years of age. Participants were recruited from September 14, 1999, to January 4, 2000; October 10, 2005, to December 16, 2005; and September 22, 2009, to June 4, 2012, from among children attending an AOM prevention trial and children visiting local outpatient clinics in Oulu, Finland.

Interventions

Children were randomly allocated to receive either 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin-clavulanate or a placebo mixture per day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the time to the disappearance of MEE as defined by a normal tympanogram finding (A curve) from both ears on 2 consecutive measurement days. Parents performed daily tympanometry at home. The study physician performed tympanometry and otoscopy at study entry, after 3 and 7 days, and then weekly until both ears were healthy. The main secondary outcome measures were the time to normal otoscopy findings and the proportion of children without persistent MEE at 14 days and 2 months.

Results

Middle ear effusion disappeared 2.0 weeks (13.7 days) earlier (P = 0.02) in the antimicrobial group (mean time, 2.7 weeks; 95% CI, 1.7–3.7) than in the placebo group (4.7 weeks; 95% CI, 3.6–5.7). Normal otoscopy findings were observed 1.4 weeks sooner in the antimicrobial group than in the placebo group (P = 0.02). On day 14, 69% of children in the antimicrobial group and 38% in the placebo group had normal tympanometry findings (number needed to treat, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0–10.5). On day 60, 2 children (5%) in the antimicrobial group and 10 children (24%) in the placebo group had persistent MEE (P = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

Antimicrobial treatment effectively reduced the duration of MEE and possible concomitant hearing impairment in children with AOM. Antimicrobial treatment also reduced the risk for persistent MEE.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6d0ec8ba]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) natural history and observation thresholds are described as follows: Short-term natural history shows rates of spontaneous resolution or improvement ranging from 28% to 52% within 3 or 4 months of diagnosis. Most studies of tympanostomy tube efficacy required documented bilateral OME for at least 3 months before entry into the study, and one group enrolled children with at least 2 months of bilateral OME. Because of these restrictions, there are no data to support tympanostomy tube insertion in children with OME of brief duration (less than 2 to 3 months), and observation until the OME has been documented for at least 3 months can avoid unnecessary surgery. Children with OME who are at risk for developmental delays or disorders are excluded from this recommendation and should therefore be managed on an individual basis when OME is diagnosed.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgery — shared decision making and age-based procedure selection emphasizes that there are 2 aspects of decision making (surgery vs additional observation, and procedure selection), candidacy depends on hearing status, associated symptoms, developmental risk, and anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution, and the poorest spontaneous resolution occurs when effusion is chronic (≥ 3 months) or associated with a type B (flat curve) tympanogram; once surgery is chosen, shared decision making is limited for children < 4 years old because tympanostomy tubes are recommended, whereas in children ≥ 4 years old options include tympanostomy tube placement alone (offers the most reliable short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss and caregivers of at-risk children perceive large improvements after tube placement), adenoidectomy alone (offers comparable OME control to tubes at 6 and 12 months but may be less reliable in the short term, reduces the need for repeat surgery, has more potential anesthetic- and procedure-related complications, and some children may need additional surgery for tympanostomy tube insertion), adenoidectomy plus myringotomy without tubes (has outcomes comparable to tubes with less otorrhea and tympanic membrane sequelae, but tympanostomy tube insertion offers more reliable short-term effusion resolution and middle ear ventilation and is preferable when potential relapse must be minimized or when pronounced inflammation is present), and adenoidectomy plus tympanostomy tube placement (offers combined benefits, especially reducing repeat surgery in children with a history of tympanostomy tube placement, and may benefit children with nasal obstruction or recurrent sinonasal infections insufficient alone to justify adenoidectomy).

Otitis media with effusion (OME) outcome assessment and documentation — clinicians are encouraged to document patient-centered outcomes when managing children with OME to ensure patient follow-up and assess effectiveness, and resolution can be documented by normal tympanic membrane mobility with pneumatic otoscopy or a sharp peak on tympanometry with either normal middle ear pressure (type A curve) or negative pressure (type C1 curve); for children with tympanostomy tubes, resolution can be documented by an intact and patent tube with otoscopy or a large ear canal volume with tympanometry. Improved hearing can be documented through age-appropriate comprehensive audiometry, and improved quality of life can be measured using the OM-6, which has 6 brief questions; the caregiver completes the survey at baseline and again after a minimum follow-up period of 1 month, and a change score rates clinical change as trivial, small, moderate, or large. The time interval for assessing OME outcomes is at the discretion of the clinician; for watchful waiting or surveillance, outcome assessment can take place at a follow-up visit, and for surgery it can take place at the postoperative or subsequent follow-up visit; if documentation is not possible because of loss to follow-up, this should be noted in the medical record along with attempts to contact the family.

INTRODUCTION

Otitis media (OM) is a common inflammatory condition of the middle ear that predominantly affects children. With more than 700 million cases annually, OM accounts for a majority of pediatric emergency department visits and antibiotic prescriptions worldwide. OM presents itself as a continuum of symptoms with acute or chronic characteristics. Acute otitis media (AOM) is associated with an abrupt onset, considerable pain, and clear signs of infection and inflammation in the middle ear (ME). In contrast, otitis media with effusion (OME), is defined as a chronic and low-grade inflammation of the ME, without signs of acute infection (e.g. no fever or earache) and with nonpurulent effusion persisting in the ME for more than 3 months. This prolonged accumulation of effusion causes a conductive hearing loss, which makes OME the most common cause of reversible hearing loss in children. If untreated, it may over time lead to speech delay, as well as cognitive and developmental problems. OME can occur as a sequela of AOM, but the precise pathogenesis is still not fully understood, including the mechanisms contributing to initiation, continuation, and spontaneous resolution of inflammation, as well as the relative roles and the interplay of the microbiota (pathogens and normal flora), the host immune response, and other host characteristics.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion, a collection of fluid behind the ear drum without inflammatory signs, is often called "glue ear" when present for six weeks. It is an increasingly common presentation in primary care and is probably the most common reason for surgery in children. Otitis media with effusion can lead to significant hearing loss, especially when both ears are affected, and has an important impact on children's lives and development. By the age of 4 years, approximately 80% of children will have had an episode of otitis media with effusion, most of which resolve naturally with an average duration of six to 10 weeks; only 10% of episodes last a year or more. However some cases do not resolve quickly and remain a cause for concern, contributing to variable referral rates and surgery (grommets) in between one and five per 1000 children each year.

A recent review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence found no proven effective medical treatments for otitis media with effusion that are applicable in primary care, where most children are seen. Because the condition might usually be expected to resolve naturally, watchful waiting or active monitoring for three months is now an established clinical recommendation. Active monitoring of such children may be done in primary or secondary care, although questions have been asked as to whether general practitioners have the techniques for active monitoring or whether use of tympanometry in this setting would lead to over-referral. During such periods anticipating natural resolution, temporising medical management is often given, including off-licence use of topical intranasal corticosteroids. The reasons for use of topical steroids include preliminary evidence of effectiveness and lack of proven effectiveness of other commonly given treatments such as antibiotics, decongestants, and antihistamines, which are associated with several potential harms and disadvantages, some of which are major ones such as antibiotic resistance. Autoinflation is not of proven effectiveness, and achieving cooperation is difficult with the youngest children.

### Evidence-based answer… [^32fb05fa]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which treatments for persistent otitis media with effusion are beneficial. Evidence-Based Answer Treatments such as antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines/decongestants, and mucolytics afford no long-term benefit in the treatment of patients with otitis media with effusion. Surgical treatments such as ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy improve hearing. However, surgery has conflicting effects on improving language development and behavior. There is inconclusive evidence that autoinflation of the eustachian tube with a nasal balloon improves resolution of OME. Evidence Summary OME is defined as middle ear effusion without acute inflammation. Many treatments have been recommended, although data supporting them are limited.

The results of three meta-analyses 1–3 showed that antibiotics increased the resolution of OME in the short-term. However, the results of a conflicting meta-analysis 4 of only higher quality, placebo-controlled studies showed that antibiotic therapy resulted in no significant difference compared with placebo. One meta-analysis 3 looked at outcomes beyond one month and showed no significant difference in resolution of OME. The results of a well-designed systematic review 5 of the use of steroids in patients with OME found that oral and nasal steroids do not have any significant benefit in the long-term when used alone or with antibiotics. A subsequent randomized controlled trial 6 of oral steroids given with antibiotics reached similar conclusions.

Recommendations from Others A recent evidence-based practice guideline 18 from the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommends against the use of antibiotics, steroids, antihistamine/decongestants, mucolytics, and autoinflation in the routine treatment of OME. Surgery for persistent OME should be reserved for use in children with significant hearing loss, persistent symptoms, risk factors for developmental difficulties, or structural damage to the tympanic membrane or middle ear. Antibiotics, with or without steroids, can be considered if the parents or caregivers are strongly opposed to surgery.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotic therapy or offering observation with close follow-up in patients aged 6–23 months without severe signs or symptoms. Initiate antibiotic therapy if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the focus of an updated multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline published by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Based on data from clinical trials, the guideline recommends against using antihistamines, antibiotics, oral steroids, and intranasal steroids for OME. To understand practice patterns related to these guidelines, we assessed nationally representative data. Despite controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other potential confounders individualized for each medication class, an increased risk of antihistamine (odds ratio [OR], 3.53), antibiotic (OR, 4.31), and intranasal steroid administration (OR, 3.58) was seen when OME was diagnosed. These analyses have demonstrated opportunities for quality improvement in the care of patients with OME, quantifying gaps in practice relevant to proposed quality measures. Education targeted according to practice setting may facilitate appropriate therapy and/or referral for definitive intervention in children with OME.

Acute otitis media (AOM) evidence synthesis — Cochrane review — described scope and overall effects of antibiotics across pediatric ages. In a Cochrane Review, Sanders et al identified 10 studies that met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial, (2) compared antibiotic versus placebo or antibiotic versus observation, (3) age 1 month to 15 years. The authors' conclusions were that antibiotics produced a small reduction in the number of children with pain 2 to 7 days after diagnosis, that most cases spontaneously remit with no complications (NNT = 16), and that antibiotics were most beneficial in children younger than 2 years with bilateral AOM and in children with otorrhea.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterized by the presence of effusion behind an intact tympanic membrane in the absence of other signs or symptoms of acute inflammation. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 37% of patients within 3 months, with middle ear effusions (MEEs) discharged through the eustachian tube or absorbed on their own. However, in some cases, the condition persists and progresses to intractable OME, which is resistant to conventional treatment. Approximately 5–10% of patients may have symptoms for a year, and 30–40% relapse. Patients with intractable OME receive little benefit from medication or physical therapy, and the illness eventually results in cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis media, and tympanic atelectasis, which can cause severe hearing loss and significantly lower a patient's quality of life. Preventing OME from becoming intractable is a critical clinical issue since managing refractory OME has long been difficult. However, little is known about the processes by which OME worsens and becomes uncontrollable even with therapy. Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, eustachian tube dysfunction, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and concealed skull base lesions (both benign and malignant) are all linked to adult OME. It can also occur after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Infection has received more attention as the cause of OME. Before Senturia et al. found harmful bacteria in 40% of MEE samples in 1958, OME was long thought to be an aseptic inflammatory illness. Numerous investigations have documented the identification of different bacterial infections from MEE in OME patients due to advancements in clinical testing. It has long been unknown what causes inflammation to persist in OME and what part certain bacteria play in this process.

Background and Objectives

Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment in children. Controversies regarding antibiotic treatment for OM have accumulated in the past decade, and there seem to be more dilemmas than certainties. The objectives of this article are to provide the state-of-the art review on achievements in treatment of all different stages of OM, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media, and to outline the future research areas.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

Review Methods

All types of articles related to OM treatment published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 286 articles related to OM treatment were reviewed by the panel members; 114 relevant quality articles were identified and summarized.

Results

New evidence emerged on beneficial results of antibiotic treatment, compared with observation of AOM in young children who were diagnosed based on stringent criteria. In OME, the main results were related to a nonsignificant benefit of adenoidectomy versus tympanostomy tube placement alone in the treatment of chronic OME in younger children. Other modalities of OM treatment were studied and described herein.

Conclusions and Implications For Practice

Significant progress has been made in advancing the knowledge on the treatment of OM. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.
