## Question

External rotation of foot to correct adduction while calcaneus remains
in varus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether external rotation of the foot can correct forefoot adduction while the calcaneus remains in varus, and what the biomechanical and clinical implications of that maneuver are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomy and mechanics of clubfoot deformity and how the hindfoot and forefoot interact. Then, I should verify what the Ponseti method actually does and whether it isolates or couples hindfoot and forefoot correction. Next, I will examine whether external rotation alone can meaningfully correct adduction without addressing varus, and what the limits are. After that, I should review evidence on residual deformity patterns and the role of bracing and osteotomies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and outline safer alternatives if the calcaneus is fixed in varus.

> Let me first confirm the deformity components and their coupling. Clubfoot is a three-dimensional deformity with hindfoot equinus and varus, midfoot cavus, and forefoot adduction. These elements are mechanically linked through the subtalar and midtarsal joints, so isolated correction of one plane often fails without addressing the others, especially in rigid or recurrent cases [^115SXAZt].

> Wait, let me verify what the Ponseti method actually achieves. The Ponseti technique corrects the foot in a specific sequence: first supinate to align the forefoot with the hindfoot to reduce cavus, then abduct the foot while counter-pressuring the talus to derotate the subtalar complex, and finally dorsiflex to correct equinus. Importantly, abduction is coupled with eversion of the calcaneus, so the calcaneus is not left in varus during correction, and the foot is maintained in external rotation with a foot abduction brace to prevent relapse [^115gJ31L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about external rotation alone. I initially thought external rotation might directly correct adduction, but wait, I should double-check the mechanics. External rotation of the foot primarily changes the foot progression angle and does not, by itself, unlock a fixed subtalar varus or correct midfoot adduction; in fact, forcing external rotation while the calcaneus remains in varus can create shear and stress at the subtalar and midtarsal joints without correcting the underlying deformity, and may even worsen symptoms or precipitate relapse if the hindfoot is not concurrently abducted and everted [^116eHDcP] [^116797HA].

> I need to check the evidence on residual deformity patterns and what happens when varus persists. In adolescents and young adults with prior clubfoot surgery, undercorrection with persistent heel varus and forefoot adduction is common, and correction typically requires osteotomies and soft-tissue balancing rather than isolated external rotation; this reinforces that varus and adduction are coupled and that persistent varus perpetuates adduction and cavus, limiting the effectiveness of external rotation alone [^116797HA] [^115t3Hpi].

> Let me consider the role of bracing and whether it supports isolated external rotation. The foot abduction brace maintains both external rotation and dorsiflexion to oppose the deforming forces; it does not isolate external rotation, and its efficacy depends on the hindfoot having been corrected out of varus during casting, again arguing against external rotation alone as a corrective strategy for adduction when varus remains [^115gJ31L] [^116eHDcP].

> Next, I should review what to do when the calcaneus is fixed in varus. If the hindfoot varus is rigid or recurrent, selective osteotomies such as a Dwyer calcaneal osteotomy, lateral column lengthening, or midfoot procedures are used to correct the multiplanar deformity; external fixation can be employed for complex, stiff deformities when gradual correction is safer or more precise, underscoring that the solution is structural realignment rather than passive external rotation [^116797HA] [^113D7tLE] [^115k2ZhQ].

> But wait, what if the deformity is flexible and the child is young? Even in flexible cases, the Ponseti method's abduction maneuver couples external rotation with calcaneal eversion and midfoot correction; external rotation without abduction/eversion would not reliably correct adduction and risks incomplete correction or early relapse, so the clinical principle remains that hindfoot varus must be addressed concurrently with forefoot adduction [^116eHDcP].

> I should confirm the bottom line. External rotation of the foot cannot meaningfully correct forefoot adduction if the calcaneus remains in varus because the deformity is multiplanar and mechanically coupled; effective correction requires abduction with eversion of the calcaneus to derotate the subtalar complex, often supplemented by Achilles tenotomy for equinus, and maintenance in a foot abduction brace. In rigid or recurrent cases, osteotomies or external fixation are indicated to achieve a plantigrade, functional foot [^116eHDcP] [^115gJ31L] [^116797HA].

External rotation of the foot **does not correct adduction** when the calcaneus remains in varus because the hindfoot varus locks the subtalar joint, preventing the midfoot and forefoot from abducting. Effective correction requires **simultaneous correction of hindfoot varus** (via Ponseti casting or calcaneal osteotomy) to unlock the subtalar joint, allowing the forefoot to abduct and the adduction to resolve [^116eHDcP] [^116797HA]. Persistent varus blocks abduction and leads to incomplete correction or relapse, so addressing the hindfoot is essential for durable results [^116797HA].

---

## Biomechanical rationale

The subtalar joint couples hindfoot varus/valgus with forefoot adduction/abduction; **varus locks the joint**, restricting abduction. External rotation alone cannot overcome this mechanical block, so adduction persists unless varus is corrected [^116eHDcP].

---

## Clinical evidence

Ponseti casting corrects clubfoot by **abducting the foot while dorsiflexing and externally rotating**, which corrects hindfoot varus and unlocks the subtalar joint, enabling forefoot abduction and correction of adduction [^116eHDcP]. When varus is not corrected, adduction persists or recurs despite external rotation, underscoring the need to address the hindfoot [^116797HA].

---

## Consequences of uncorrected calcaneal varus

Persistent varus causes:

- **Persistent adduction**: Uncorrected varus maintains midfoot/forefoot adduction and cavus, causing incomplete correction or relapse [^116797HA].
- **Gait abnormalities**: Varus with adduction produces in-toeing, instability, and abnormal loading, risking pain and arthritis [^115FHyK1].
- **Treatment failure**: External rotation without varus correction leads to recurrence and may require additional surgery [^116797HA].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

Effective correction requires **addressing both deformities**:

- **Ponseti method**: Serial casting with abduction, dorsiflexion, and external rotation corrects varus and unlocks the subtalar joint, allowing abduction and durable correction [^116eHDcP].
- **Surgical options**: For rigid varus, calcaneal osteotomy (e.g. Dwyer) or lateral column lengthening corrects hindfoot alignment and enables forefoot abduction [^116797HA].
- **Combined approaches**: Osteotomies with soft-tissue balancing achieve multiplanar correction when casting is insufficient [^116797HA].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Treatment approach** | **Effect on adduction** | **Effect on varus** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| External rotation alone | Minimal/no correction | No correction | Incomplete correction or relapse |
| Ponseti method | Corrected | Corrected | High success, low relapse |
| Calcaneal osteotomy | Corrected (after unlocking) | Corrected | Effective for rigid varus |

---

External rotation of the foot **does not correct adduction** when the calcaneus remains in varus because hindfoot varus mechanically blocks subtalar motion and forefoot abduction. Correcting varus is necessary to unlock the joint and achieve lasting adduction correction [^116eHDcP].

4. Special tests

1) Tests for rigid or flexible flat feet [Observe patient's medial longitudinal arch standing, standing on his/her toes, and sitting. Presence of an arch while on one's toes or sitting and absent with standing suggests flexible flat feet. Absence of an arch in all positions suggests rigid flat feet.]

2) Thigh foot angle [Measure of tibial torsion. Patient prone with knee flexed to 90° and foot in relaxed position; measure angle between the axis of the thigh and foot. The thigh foot angle rotates laterally with increasing age; the upper limit of normal is 30°. Negative values are common in infants. Negative and positive values beyond the normal range are referred to as medial (internal) tibial torsion and lateral (external) tibial torsion respectively.]

3) Forefoot adduction correction test [Patient supine or prone. The lateral border of the foot is usually straight. If forefoot adduction is correctable to neutral or beyond with abduction it is "correctable" and if "fixed" it likely requires orthopedic intervention and casting.]

4) Anterior drawer and talar tilt tests for lateral ankle sprains. [The anterior drawer tests the stability of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and the talar tilt the stability of the calcaneofibular (CFL) ligament. It is normal to have a small amount of movement but pain, a soft endpoint and marked difference from side to side all indicate injury to the ligament. For the anterior drawer the ankle is relaxed in a neutral or slightly plantar flexed position, the tibia and fibula are stabilized with one hand while the other hand attempts to pull the talus forward out of the ankle mortise. The talar tilt is performed by inverting the calcaneus with the ankle in neutral position.]

5. External rotation test for "high" ankle sprains (injuries to the anterior tibiofibular ligament) [Stabilize the lower leg in neutral with one hand and abduct the foot with the other hand. The test is positive if it produces pain.]

5. Flexibility

The ankle, subtalar, forefoot and MTP joints should be moved thru active range and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (gastrocnemius muscles).

Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Radler and Mindlerprovided a comprehensive review of different treatment strategies for severe recurrent clubfoot deformity in patients who underwent Ponseti casting and/or previous surgery. Treatment options were discussed according to different components of the residual deformity, including subtalar rotation, ankle equinus, cavus foot, heel varus, and forefoot adduction. For each component, the authors reviewed various bony and soft-tissue procedures but noted a current trend toward external fixation for the stiff clubfoot with severe deformity owing to the potential for gradual correction with minimal bony procedures. Although the authors included clinical photographss and radiographs, no results were reported.

In a recent review on the management of relapsed, residual, and neglected clubfeet, Eidelman et aldiscussed the challenges of selecting appropriate treatment strategies in this heterogeneous group. The authors divided relapses into the following 3 groups: early (from 6 to 30 months), older children (from 30 months to 8 years), and adolescents (9 years and older). They note that many patients in the adolescent group were treated with previous surgical procedures rather than the Ponseti method alone, although this number is steadily decreasing. They summarized their preferred method of treatment for rigid deformities that includes osteotomies and application of an external fixation frame for gradual correction. The authors prefer using a standard Taylor spatial frame for the correction of equinus in younger children and the butt frame, which includes a U-shaped plate around the foot, for the correction of midfoot and forefoot deformities.

Intervention

The Ponseti method is a conservative correction widely used for the initial treatment of infants born with CTEV. The technique is divided into 2 phases: (1) the casting phase and (2) the bracing phase.

Before 2013 (period I), several surgeons and medical teams in our hospital performed the Ponseti method. From 2013 onwards (period II), the Ponseti method was performed by a single dedicated medical team (a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon and nurses who had attended Ponseti method courses). It should be noted that the dedicated surgeon in period II was present in period I. The other particularity of this intervention during period II was the application of a patient-centered and family-centered method of collaborative care. Indeed, the disorder and its treatment were even discussed during prenatal consultations when the team attempted to identify parents' concerns and build positive relationships with the families. The Ponseti method's benefits were explained and emphasized in comparison with the previous technique (posteromedial release).

The Ponseti method's casting phase consists of several manipulations and long leg-casting. Serial casting is done with above-the-knee casts, as below-the-knee casts cannot maintain the foot's abduction and external rotation. For the first cast, the first metatarsal must be raised, which means supinating the forefoot to align it with the hindfoot and decrease cavus. The foot should never be pronated. The ensuing casts maintain the foot in pure abduction using counter pressure on the neck of the talus. The calcaneus must not be touched as this might block its motion: it must be free to swing out from underneath the talus and thereby abduct, evert, and dorsiflex. Active dorsiflexion should not be attempted before the subtalar joint is fully corrected and/or until after a tenotomy.

Our Clinical Series Review

Overcorrection

The problem of overcorrection of the clubfoot deformity represented the largest group in our study (25 patients, 37 feet). The primary presenting problems were related to severe heel valgus, lateral translation of the calcaneus relative to the talus, and fixed forefoot abduction. To address this deformity, 66 procedures were performed in this group (1.78 procedures per foot). If the deformity was flexible, a more traditional pes planovalgus deformity correction procedure was performed with either a lateral column lengthening or medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy or both, coupled with a soft-tissue advancement with FDL tendon transfer as necessary. The more severe deformity with limited flexibility often required a more complex procedure with a limited arthrodesis such as a lateral column lengthening calcaneal-cuboid joint fusion with medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft-tissue reefing of the spring ligament complex, and a medial column midtarsal arthrodesis for correction of residual deformity. A complete listing of the procedures required to manage this group of patients are listed in (Appendix 1).

Undercorrection

Undercorrection of the clubfoot deformity affected 25 patients (28 feet) in our clinical series. The undercorrected clubfeet often had residual heel varus and cavus deformity with forefoot adduction or fixed forefoot varus and more stiffness of the hindfoot than in the overcorrected patients. The primary procedures to correct these deformities were valgus producing closing or lateral sliding calcaneal osteotomies with midfoot osteotomies to derotate the forefoot out of varus and also correct adduction or cavus (Appendix 2). For the mild to moderate deformities, a single-staged correction was performed. However, there were several severe fixed deformities which required a computer-assisted multiplanar external fixation device for gradual correction of the forefoot varus deformity. Soft-tissue balancing was often required with anterior tibialis tendon transfer to the second or third cuneiform.

When the residual cavovarus deformity was primarily localized in the midfoot, a midfoot biplanar transverse osteotomy, often with an allograft medial wedge, was done along with peroneus longus to brevis transfer and anterior tibialis tendon transfer to the third cuneiform. Additional metatarsal osteotomies were also added when necessary. Overall, 76 procedures were required in this group of patients for an average of 2.81 procedures per foot.

### Relationships between first metatarsal and sesamoid positions and other clinically relevant parameters for hallux valgus surgery [^111Ygko3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Relationships between hallux valgus (HV) and other measurements within the first ray have been extensively studied. It is becoming more popular to correct HV deformity with tarsometatarsal joint arthrodesis while internally (varus) rotating the first metatarsal. This, in turn, reduces the sesamoid position when viewed in the dorsoplantar projection on radiographs. However, it has been shown that not all HV deformities have pathological external (valgus) rotation of the first metatarsal. In this study, we explored the relationships between frontal-plane rotations of the first metatarsal as well as the sesamoids, and other factors not limited to the first ray, to better understand the pathological process of HV deformity and to assist in surgical planning. We found that when adjusting for these covariates, the only factor associated with first metatarsal external rotation was having less metatarsus adductus. Sesamoid rotation, on the other hand, was independently associated with the HV angle, tibial sesamoid position, and medial column collapse. When surgically treating HV, correction of sesamoid rotation may need to be prioritized.

### Combined lateral and transcuneiform without medial osteotomy for residual clubfoot for children [^1162MEPi]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Residual deformity in resistant clubfoot is not uncommon. The "bean-shaped foot" exhibits forefoot adduction and midfoot supination and may interfere with function due to poor foot placement. For children less than 5 years of age we describe a corrective procedure combining a closing wedge cuboidal osteotomy and trans-midfoot rotation procedure without a medial opening wedge osteotomy. We retrospectively reviewed twelve patients (14 feet), mean age 4.7 years (range, 4–5 years), who had undergone the procedure to correct forefoot adduction and midfoot supination deformities. We obtained minimal access via a small lateral skin incision. Cuboid lateral wedge osteotomy was followed by transcuneiform osteotomy using a Kirschner wire as a guide under an image intensifier. The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 2.6 years; range, 2–3.2 years). All patients had qualitative improvement in correction of adduction and supination deformities. Radiographically there was an improvement in adduction deformity, the mean anteroposterior talo-first metatarsal and calcaneo-fifth metatarsal angles improved by 28 degrees (from 40 degrees to 12 degrees) and by 11 degrees (from 21 degrees to 10 degrees). The supination improved by 11 degrees (from 19 degrees to 8 degrees) and the cavus improved by 17 degrees (from 30 degrees to 13 degrees). The short-term outcome was reliable and this combination is useful for children younger than 5 years old where the medial cuneiform ossification center remained poorly defined.

### Correction power of percutaneous adductor tendon release (PATR) for the treatment of hallux valgus: a cadaveric study [^111h42nT]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteotomies are commonly used in order to correct hallux valgus deformity. However, soft tissue structures also play an essential role in the etiology, progression, and treatment of hallux valgus (HV). The purpose of the present study was to analyze the correcting power (varus), reduction strength (sesamoid) and rotation of metatarsal and proximal phalanx after percutaneous adductor tendon release (PATR). To date, no study addresses this issue. Eleven cadaveric fresh-frozen below-the-knee cadaveric lower limbs with associated hallux valgus deformity were used. These specimens were subjected to a constant abduction force after PATR. HV and intermetatarsal angles showed statistically significant differences when comparing the preoperative and postoperative periods. PATR showed to be a reliable technique as the adductor tendon was completely released in 9 cases, and 75% released in the remaining 2 feet. The study supports that PATR provides powerful and quantifiable correction of HV deformity and can be accurately performed percutaneously.

### Strength evaluation of lateral calcaneal wall with circular external fixation application in cadaveric specimens [^115JWeDd]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Circular external fixation is a useful treatment option for the correction of complex trauma, extremity deformity, osteomyelitis, and reconstruction of the foot and ankle. The goal of the present study was to determine the degrees of bolt rotation required to create enough wire tension to cause structural failure of the lateral calcaneal wall when stressed with both olive and smooth wires in a cadaveric model. Ten fresh, thawed, below-the-knee specimens were tested at the San Diego Cadaveric Academic Research Symposium. The mean bolt rotation required to pull an olive wire through the lateral wall of the calcaneus was 79.8° ± 32.81°, and the mean bolt rotation required to "walk" a skinny wire (narrow diameter) and create 1 mm of cortical bone failure was 50.5° ± 30.91°. The results of the present investigation further define and elucidate the appropriate "Russian tensioning" technique applicable for external fixation of the calcaneus using olive or skinny wires in the case of fracture repair or compression arthrodesis.

### Safe placement of intramedullary nail and inter-physician variability in guidewire placement in retrograde tibiotalocalcaneal fusions [^112bcgDM]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Retrograde tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis is a salvage procedure for severe arthrosis and deformity of both the tibiotalar and subtalar joints and requires image-confirmed placement of a retrograde guidewire. The anatomical shape of the calcaneus creates a situation in which guidewire placement can be skewed on imaging based on the angle of either internal or external rotation. As a result, the aims of our study were to (1) determine the optimal angle(s) of rotation required to accurately depict guidewire placement on imaging and (2) evaluate and describe the effects angle of rotation has on physician assessment of guidewire placement. Using a C-arm x-ray, images of cadavers with both correctly and incorrectly placed guidewires were taken at 5° increments of internal and external rotation of the cadaveric lower extremity and assessed for accuracy of guidewire depiction. The images revealed that the correctly placed guidewire appeared displaced medially at angles of 35° and 40° of external rotation. Conversely, the incorrectly placed guidewire appeared to be correctly placed at between 10° and 40° of external rotation. These images were then disseminated to various physicians including orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists to determine the ability of physicians to correctly appreciate guidewire placement. Using the responses from 35 physicians, it was found that certain angles of internal and external rotation preclude physicians from correctly determining guidewire placement. We found, based on chi-square analysis, that we were able to reject our null hypothesis with a p value of < .001 leading to the conclusion that indeed angle of rotation and guidewire placement can lead to false depictions of guidewire placement. In conclusion, our study gave objective measurements to guide foot placement during tibiotalocalcaneal fusion to decrease the risk incorrectly depicted medial guidewire placement and subsequent incorrect intramedullary nail placement.

### Cavovarus foot deformity with multiple tarsal coalitions: functional and three-dimensional preoperative assessment [^115LaDUo]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

In rare instances, tarsal coalition leads to cavovarus foot deformity, although the pathologic mechanism leading to this deformity is not clear. This article reports a case of a 14-year-old boy presenting a severe cavovarus deformity of the right foot with talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular coalitions, and a mild cavus deformity of the left foot with a single talocalcaneal coalition. Computed tomography and postoperative histologic analysis demonstrated a synostosis between talus and calcaneus and a fibrous calcaneonavicular coalition with partial ossification. Instrumented gait analysis revealed a limited range of ankle plantar flexion and increased external rotation of the ankle. Associated skeletal malformations including incomplete hemimelia of the forearm and scoliosis raised the possibility of a teratologic condition, but neurologic examination, spinal magnetic resonance imaging, and nerve conduction velocities were normal. The progressive ossification of combined coalitions during growth of the foot may have been one factor leading to this complex foot deformity. The fine-wire electromyogram showed normal tibialis anterior and posterior muscle activity. Small soft tissue tears in the sinus tarsi may have led to a mild reflexive increase of the muscle tone and tendon shortening, which pulled the forefoot into adduction and the heel into varus, and raised the medial arch. Mechanical alterations of the ankle appear secondary to the heel varus and to the progressive deformity of the talus. Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction and gait analysis appeared to be helpful additional parameters to understanding the pathomechanics of this complex foot deformity and for preoperative planning of triple arthrodesis.

### Cost-effectiveness of club-foot treatment in low-income and middle-income countries by the ponseti method [^116CuCDU]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Club foot or congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is one of the most common congenital musculoskeletal deformities, and occurs approximately in one in 800 live births. The vast majority of patients are found in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Untreated CTEV can lead to severe deformity, but with timely and correct management it is curable.

CTEV is defined as an inward rotation of the foot, with four components: cavus, forefoot adductus, hind foot varus and equinus. Two of three patients occur in boys and in every other case, the condition affects both feet. The deformity causes patients to walk on the side or back of their feet leading to callus formation, and potential infections in the skin and bone. With severely hampered mobility, these patients are unable to work; thus, this deformity contributes not only to ill health but also to poverty.

Several techniques are available to correct CTEV, and often involve invasive surgery. Since 1996, however, the non-surgical Ponseti method of correction has become increasingly popular, proving to be effective in more than 90% of patients. The technique encompasses gradual manipulation of the foot into the correct position through the aid of serial application of casts, generally followed by a percutaneous tenotomy of the Achilles tendon and a prolonged follow-up programme with foot abduction braces. Initially reserved for early correction of uncomplicated idiopathic patients, today the Ponseti method is being adapted for complex non-idiopathic patients and for patients presenting up to and beyond 2 years of age.

Widely implemented in high-income countries, the Ponseti method has been described as highly suitable for healthcare settings with scarce resources and is being increasingly used in LMICs as well. Today, programmes for training and implementation of CTEV treatment by using the Ponseti method are being implemented in most countries in the world, often with considerable success. A recent study by Shabtai and colleagues found evidence of the Ponseti treatment being offered in 113 of the 193 United Nations member states. However, 80 countries have no evidence of such activity, and in most countries the programmes do not cover all new patients. Many programmes are initiated or supported by international Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Ponseti Internationaland CURE Clubfoot.

### Foot deformity correction with hexapod external fixator, the ortho-SUV frame ™ [^115k2ZhQ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

External fixators enable distraction osteogenesis and gradual foot deformity corrections. Hexapod fixators have become more popular than the Ilizarov apparatus. The Ortho-SUV Frame™ (OSF; Ortho-SUV Ltd, St. Petersburg, Russia), a hexapod that was developed in 2006, allows flexible joint attachment such that multiple assemblies are available. We assessed the reduction capability of several assemblies. An artificial bone model with a 270-mm-long longitudinal foot was used. A 130-mm tibial full ring was attached 60 mm proximal to the ankle joint. A 140-mm, two-third ring forefoot was attached perpendicular to the metatarsal bone axis. A 130-mm, two-third ring hindfoot was attached parallel to the tibial ring. A V-osteotomy, which was combined with 2 oblique osteotomies at the navicular-cuboid bone and the calcaneus, was performed. The middle part of the foot, including the talus, was connected to the tibial ring. We assessed 5 types of forefoot applications and 4 types of hindfoot applications. The range of correction included flexion/extension in the sagittal plane, adduction/abduction in the horizontal plane, and pronation/supination in the coronal plane. Additionally, we reported the short-term results in 9 clinical cases. The forefoot applications in which the axis of the hexapod was parallel to the axis of the metatarsal bones had good results, with 52°/76° for flexion/extension, 48°/53° for adduction/abduction, and 43°/51° for pronation/supination. The hindfoot applications in which the hexapod encircled the ankle joint also had good results, with corresponding values of 47°/58°, 20°/35°, and 28°/31°. Clinically, all deformities were corrected as planned. Thus, multiple assemblies and a wide range of corrections are available with the OSF.

### Late effects of clubfoot deformity in adolescent and young adult patients whose initial treatment was an extensive soft-tissue release: topic review and clinical case series [^115t3Hpi]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical Approaches to the Adolescent Clubfoot Deformity

Preoperative evaluation is critical to evaluate the presenting complaints and to create a rational surgical plan for management. Assessment of deformities, such as heel varus or valgus, residual cavus, or forefoot adductus, should be done in both the standing position and the seated position with the hindfoot held in neutral. The relationship between the hindfoot and the forefoot should be carefully examined to determine whether there is deformity between the hindfoot and forefoot and whether it is a flexible or fixed deformity. Weight-bearing CT was not available for evaluation of patients in our clinical series but would aid the surgeon in better understanding these 3-dimensional deformities, especially in the hindfoot.

It is important to determine the range of motion of the critical joints of the hindfoot which may require an examination under fluoroscopy to accurately determine where the primary motion is occurring. The ankle joint in many patients is very stiff, and compensatory range of motion through the talonavicular joint is often mistaken for ankle joint range of motion. The surgeon should be aware that a talonavicular arthrodesis in this setting would therefore eliminate a significant amount of dorsiflexion-plantarflexion range of motion. In addition, the lack of ankle joint dorsiflexion may not be improved with an Achilles tendon lengthening procedure, given the arthrofibrosis or bony impingement at the tibiotalar joint. Careful examination of muscle strength is critical in looking for imbalances such as overpull of the anterior tibialis muscle as a deforming force for the dorsal bunion deformity. Previous over lengthening of the gastroc-soleus complex may require tendon transfers of the peroneals or the toe flexors to the calcaneus to restore the plantar flexor power. The location of previous incisions about the foot and ankle should be taken into account when planning future reconstructive procedures to reduce the potential for wound healing complications.

### Temporal variation of scores along the course of the ponseti treatment in older children: a ready guide to progress of treatment [^1135t9hK]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to graphically study the correction trend along the course of Ponseti treatment in older children with idiopathic clubfeet.

Methods

The temporal variation of total Pirani and Dimeglio scores and their individual components at each casting session was represented graphically. Tenotomy correction was accounted for separately. We classified 0 to 4 as early, 4 to 8 as midlevel, and beyond 8 as late casts to describe the sequence of treatment.

Results

A total of 27 patients (39 feet; bilateral in 12) were studied. The average patient age was 4.78 ± 2.36 years. Rigid equinus was the more severe pretreatment deformity in Pirani system and also the most difficult to treat component. Posterior crease and medial crease were least severe and were treated in early casts. Reducibility of lateral head of talus, curved lateral border of foot, and empty heel were moderately severe and showed a gradual improvement pattern over subsequent casting sessions. For Dimeglio components, equinus was the most resistant deformity, and it persisted until late casts. Adduction, rotation, and varus were moderately severe, and they followed a gradual improvement slope. Several components/scores did not turn 0 after correction for older clubfoot children.

Conclusions

The treatment graphs for older clubfoot children adequately illustrated the initial severity, number of Ponseti casts used, correction of total scores and their individual components over sequential casting sessions, tenotomy influence, and the residual deformities.

The lateral column lengthening procedure has been used in the surgical management of congenital and adult-acquired pes planus. Lateral column lengthening allows correction of the abducted forefoot and subsequent improvement in the medial longitudinal arch. However, owing to the inconsistent healing times and complications, we opted to pursue a novel approach to the lateral column lengthening procedure, the calcaneal Z osteotomy.

### Functional adaptation of the calcaneus in historical foot binding [^116AMR4i]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Biomechanics of the bound foot

The range of motion in the ankle of a bound‐foot female is reduced by at least 60%. 18 The center of mass is shifted posteriorly from the forefoot to the calcaneus, which is reoriented by about 40 degrees sagittally with respect to the normal anatomical position (Fig. 2). Although the longitudinal arch in a bound foot looks significantly steeper than its normal shape, it is externally compressed by the applied bandage, instead of being a part of the natural tension‐compression assembly. The shock‐dampening function of the foot in this case is essentially eliminated, with the calcaneus acting as a rigid extension of the lower leg and bearing most of the body weight. Despite this profound skeletal deformation, the short bones of the foot remain mechanically competent; among many reported adverse effects of foot binding, such as excruciating pain, circulation impairment, balance problems, infections, and others, fractures of the calcaneus have never been mentioned. 14, 15

Figure 4
Photographic illustration of the hand held dynamometer. The hand held dynamometer consists of an adjustable foot fixation, a torque wrench and a goniometer. The foot fixation has parts supporting the forefoot and calcaneus. These parts are connected by a rod, allowing independent adjustments in rotation and abduction/adduction. The forefoot part is equipped with a fixation point to the table when needed (*).

The children will be asked to lie prone on a bench, with both feet overhanging the edge. The lower leg will lie in such a way that the fibula head and the lateral malleolus of the fibula are on the same height. The foot will be firmly attached to the adjustable foot plate for fixation. The ankle will be plantar flexed by the researcher, applying an external plantar flexion moment of 4 Nm, as measured using the toque wrench. The corresponding γ (f-t) is measured (further described as the 4 Nm plantar flexion angle). Subsequently, this procedure is repeated for 1 Nm plantar flexion and, 0 Nm, 1 Nm dorsiflexion, 4 Nm dorsiflexion and 6 Nm dorsiflexion. All measurements will be repeated six times and each moment will be exerted for five seconds. The γ (f-t) will be read out from the inclinometer simultaneously at the end of these 5 seconds at the target ankle joint moment. Positive values refer to an external dorsal flexion moment (Nm) of the dynamometer and dorsal flexion angle (°) of the ankle joint. There will be five seconds rest between each repetition and two minutes rest between each condition. The conditions will always be applied in the described order.

Manufacturing the KAFO

The KAFO will be custom made by certified orthotists using polyethylene or polypropylene and foam (for a covered inside). Two transverse bars (polyethylene or polypropylene) above and below the knee will be used to reinforce and stiffen the KAFO. Bandages of nylon Velcro straps will be placed at three locations: 1) as high as possible on the thigh, 2) directly above the patella and 3) directly below the patella. A circular foot fixation, made of leather or soft polyethylene, will be used for foot fixation. This circular foot fixation will be closed with two velcro straps. One strap overlaps the patient's most convex part of the ankle and one strap will overlap the patient's foot proximal of the caput ossis metatarsal I and V. Deformity of the patient's foot will be corrected by the use of an internal three point pressure system (see Figure 2).

Figure 2

(a)The equines correction will be performed by exerting force on the dorsal side of the lower leg (just below the knee), on the instep of the foot and under the ball of the foot. (b)The valgus correction of the calcaneus will be performed by a exerting a force laterally on the heel/calcaneus, laterally on the middle of the lower leg and medially on the lower leg, just above the medial malleolus. (c) The forefoot abduction correction will be performed by exerting a medial stabilization force calcaneus and talus and a lateral force on the calcaneus en the fifth os metatarsi. (d) The varus correction of the calcaneus will be performed by exerting force on the medial part of the calcaneus, medially on the middle of the lower leg and laterally on the lower leg, just above the lateral malleolus.

### Correcting residual deformity following clubfoot releases [^1141frBm]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are many possible pitfalls of clubfoot releases and it is important to recognize the problems and provide proper timely treatment. Late residual deformity following clubfoot releases include: dynamic or stiff supination and forefoot adduction deformities, intoeing gait, overcorrection, rotatory dorsal subluxation of the navicular, vascular insult to the talus with collapse, and dorsal bunion. We reviewed 134 clubfeet in 95 children who had primary clubfoot releases between 1988 and 1991. In general, the patients who underwent surgery before 6 months of age had poorer results compared with older children. Twenty-one feet (15.7%) underwent additional procedures. The most common additional procedure was split anterior tibial tendon transfer. Not all patients with residual deformities underwent additional procedures. In treating recurrent and residual deformity following a clubfoot surgery, it is most important to keep function in mind. From this series of patients treated with comprehensive clubfoot release, we have identified the most common residual deformities encountered after the initial release and effective surgical treatment when necessary.

### Correcting severe relapsed hallux varus using hexapod circular external fixator [^1135mqbX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital hallux varus is an uncommon condition that is defined as medial angulation of the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint. The toe deformity can range from only a few degrees to as severe as 90°. Various surgical techniques (that includes soft-tissue and/or bony procedure) have been described. A thickened medial capsule, medial inclination of the first metatarsocuneiform joint line, the first metatarsal longitudinal epiphyseal bracket, short first metatarsals, and an imbalance between the adductor hallucis and abductor hallucis muscles are all risk factors of recurrence. Recurrent cases are hard to treat given the three-dimensional nature of the deformity, namely supination, medial deviation, and clawing of the great toe, as well as scars or secondary bony deformation from a previous surgery. This case report describes how a hexapod circular external fixator was used to successfully treat a recurrent congenital hallux varus with a hypertrophic medial scar as a salvage procedure.

### Prevalence of specific gait abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy: influence of cerebral palsy subtype, age, and previous surgery [^111UvzoW]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2004). Low credibility.

The authors retrospectively reviewed a series of 492 consecutive cerebral palsy patients undergoing computerized motion analysis. The prevalence of 14 specific gait abnormalities was evaluated and compared based on involvement (hemiplegia, diplegia, or quadriplegia), age, and history of previous surgery (lower extremity orthopaedic surgery or rhizotomy). Stiff knee in swing, equinus, and intoeing were all seen in more than 50% of the subjects in each of the hemiplegic, diplegic, and quadriplegic groups. Increased hip flexion and crouch were also present in more than 50% of the subjects in the diplegic and quadriplegic groups, and hip adduction occurred in more than 50% of the quadriplegic subjects. The likelihood of having stiff knee in swing, out-toeing, calcaneus deformity, and crouch increased with prior surgery. The likelihood of having rotational malalignment of the leg (internal hip rotation with out-toeing), calcaneus, out-toeing, varus and valgus foot deformities, and hip internal rotation increased with age. These findings provide important information for counseling ambulatory children with cerebral palsy and their families.

### Modified dwyer osteotomy with rotation and reinsertion of autograft bone wedge for residual heel deformity despite previous delayed subtalar joint arthrodesis after calcaneal fracture [^113t5M8e]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Calcaneal fracture patterns vary widely, and many factors determine the type and timing of the treatment rendered. Severe calcaneus fractures involving joint damage, loss of heel height, and varus deformity of the tuberosity are ideally treated with open reduction and internal fixation to repair the joint surface and re-establish anatomic structure. This is not always possible owing to delayed presentation, soft tissue compromise, unrelated injuries, unstable medical condition, or lack of expertise by the treating physician. We present the case of a patient who had residual forefoot and rearfoot deformity despite undergoing delayed subtalar joint arthrodesis at an outside hospital 10 years before for a calcaneal fracture that was initially treated nonoperatively. At 4 years of follow-up after modified Dwyer calcaneal osteotomy with rotation and reinsertion of the autograft bone wedge and Cotton midfoot osteotomy, the postoperative gait was relatively normal, other than the expected lack of hindfoot mobility. The lateral column pain was resolved. The patient remained highly satisfied with the outcome at long-term follow-up of 48 months, with improved heel alignment, lack of a wide stance gait, a functional medial column, and a relatively normal gait. This case demonstrates the value of periarticular calcaneal osteotomies without the need to revise the subtalar joint arthrodesis for this challenging clinical situation.

### Practical aspects of posttrauma reconstruction with an intramedullary lengthening nail [^115oW7AB]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Limb equalization using the Ilizarov method has traditionally been accomplished with the use of external fixators. The process, termed "distraction osteogenesis", is divided into 4 phases. Phase 1: performing a low-energy osteotomy. Phase 2: the latency phase, whereby the bones remain undistracted for a period of time before being pulled apart. The typical latency phase is 7 days. Phase 3: the distraction phase. Ilizarov determined that bone regeneration best occurs with a rate of 1 mm a day, divided into 4 segments of 0.25 mm each. Finally, phase 4: the consolidation phase. It is during this time that the immature regenerate bone forms into mature bone allowing for it to regain its structure and function to allow for full weight bearing. Complications associated with external devices – (limb lengthening rails, circular external fixators) have motivated surgeons to evolve with various internal lengthening implants. –

PRECICE (Nuvasive Specialized Orthopaedics, Inc, Aliso Viejo, CA) is an implantable magnetic-controlled telescoping internal lengthening nail. Early results are encouraging. – Many orthopaedic trauma surgeons' practice includes managing complex posttraumatic malunions and nonunions. Limb reconstruction implies that the surgeon will address all components of limb alignment. This includes malalignment in the coronal (varus/valgus angulation and medial/lateral translation), sagittal (procurvatum/recurvatum and anterior/posterior translation), and axial (internal/external rotation and limb length discrepancy) planes. The ability to correct the length discrepancy without the use of an external fixator but rather with an internal lengthening nail has allowed more trauma surgeons to adopt its use. Trauma surgeons are trained to be expert in managing diaphyseal femur and tibia fractures with intramedullary nails. In addition, intramedullary nails have been expanded in use for periarticular and metaphyseal fractures. Adjunct techniques to maintain alignment (blocking screws, femoral-distractors, unicortical plating) have been elucidated. However, regardless if one is using a limb-lengthening rail, circular external fixator, or an implantable magnetic lengthening nail, the science of the Ilizarov method must be understood and adhered to. This is analogous to trauma management of complex injuries (eg, calcaneus, Pilon, bicondylar tibial plateau fractures).

### Do we really need to worry about calcaneocuboid subluxation during lateral column lengthening for planovalgus foot deformity? [^112nAUaM]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although lengthening of the lateral column through an osteotomy of the anterior calcaneus is an integral component of flatfoot reconstruction in younger patients with flexible planovalgus deformities, the procedure has been implicated in iatrogenic calcaneocuboid (CC) subluxation and subsequent degenerative changes at the CC articulation. The purpose of this study is to characterize alterations at the CC joint after lateral column lengthening (LCL) and determine if Steinmann pin stabilization of the CC joint before distraction maintains a normal relationship.

Methods

Seven matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric feet underwent preprocedure plain radiography and cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) imaging. LCL by osteotomy through the anterior calcaneus was then performed. One foot of each matched pair had a single smooth Steinmann pin placed centrally across the CC joint before osteotomy distraction. Distraction across each osteotomy was then performed and maintained with a 12-mm porous titanium wedge. Repeat imaging was obtained and compared with preprocedure studies to quantify sagittal and rotational differences at the CC articulation.

Results

Following LCL, plain radiography demonstrated statistically significant increases in the percentage of the calcaneal articular surface dorsal to the superior aspect of the cuboid in both the pinned (8.2% vs. 17.6%, P = 0.02) and unpinned (12.5% vs. 16.3%, P = 0.04) specimens. No difference in the percentage of subluxation was found between the 2 groups after LCL. CT imaging demonstrated statistically significant increases in rotation between the calcaneus and cuboid after LCL in both the pinned (7.6 ± 5.6 degrees, P = 0.01) and unpinned (17 ± 12.3 degrees, P = 0.01) specimens. The degree of rotation was greater in unpinned specimens after LCL (P = 0.043).

Conclusions

Both sagittal and rotatory subluxation seem to occur at the CC joint after LCL regardless of pin stabilization. As a single pin would be expected to limit pure translation while having little effect on rotation, it is possible that the rotational changes identified on 3-dimensional imaging are interpreted as dorsal translation when viewed 2 dimensionally using plain radiography. Consideration should therefore be given to CC stabilization with 2 pins during LCL to prevent this rotatory subluxation.

### Can selective soft tissue release and cuboid osteotomy correct neglected clubfoot? [^1136o5AT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Neglected clubfoot in older children is characterized by a stiff, nonreducible deformity with relative elongation of the lateral column of the foot with respect to the medial column. Surgical correction often has involved a double osteotomy with elongation of the medial column and shortening of the lateral column, or the use of an external fixator to achieve more gradual correction. Both approaches have shortcomings.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore (1) used objective physical examination measurements and a functional assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of cuboid osteotomy combined with a selective soft tissue release to achieve correction of neglected clubfoot in older children, (2) determined the rate of complications, and (3) ascertained whether the initial correction achieved was maintained.

Methods

We reviewed 31 patients (56 feet) older than 5 years with severe, neglected nonreducible clubfoot deformity who underwent the index procedure. Minimum followup was 2 years (average, 6 years; range, 2–9 years). Postoperatively, the Laaveg and Ponseti classification and Dimeglio score were used to grade correction. Complication rates were tallied.

Results

According to the Laaveg and Ponseti classification, 24 feet showed excellent correction, 20 good, nine fair, and three poor at 1-year followup. These results were maintained up to the latest followup. Patients showed significant improvement of Dimeglio score after surgery (p < 0.0001). Two patients had postoperative skin-related complications that healed without additional surgery.

Conclusions

Cuboid subtraction osteotomy combined with posteromedial release is an effective approach to manage a stiff nonreducible neglected clubfoot deformity in older children.

### Intra-and inter-observer reliability and repeatability of the metatarsus adductus angle in childhood: a concordance study [^115NH8v3]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A Discovery XR656 Plus X-ray system (General Electric Research, Milwaukee, WI) was used to take foot images at a source-to-image distance of 100 cm and was set to 60 kVp and 2.5 mAs. Using PACS (IMPAX; Agfa Healthcare, Mortsel, BE), we transferred radiographic images using professional digital image management. Radiographic measurements were performed using a digital radiographic imaging and measurement system AutoCad 2019 (Autodesk Inc. San Rafael, CA). Dorsoplantar radiographs for weight-bearing conditions were performed independently for each foot, with the patients standing with the knee extended. The foot was aligned to prevent internal or external rotation of the leg and was pointed straight forward, parallel to the sagittal plane. The X-ray beam was inclined 15° in the dorsal-plantar direction centered on the second tarsometatarsal joint.

We reviewed 46 weight-bearing dorsoplantar foot radiographs and excluded 14, which did not meet the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included patients over 2 years and under 8 years of age, with no history of a previous forefoot, midfoot, or rearfoot surgery, and no evidence of foot trauma that could affect foot anatomy. Exclusion criteria included neurologic disease, lower limb malformation, fracture, or prior surgery of the foot or lower limb, neuromuscular disorders, and foot scar. We established the metatarsus adductus criteria > 35°.

Metatarsus adductus measurements

To assess metatarsus adductus, different methods have been reported including Berg's method as shown in Fig. 1, Kilmartin's angle as shown in Fig. 2, Laaveg & Ponseti's angle as shown in Fig. 3, rearfoot angle as shown in Fig. 4, Root's angle as shown in Fig. 5, and Simons' angle as shown in Fig. 6.

### Acute deformity correction of lower extremities under SSEP-monitoring control [^112C3oSb]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2003). Low credibility.

Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring was performed in eight children who had undergone an acute deformity correction in the lower extremities using external fixation. Five patients showed stable evoked potentials during surgery and had no neurologic complications postoperatively. Three patients experienced evoked potential abnormalities. In one patient, 60 degrees external rotation of the foot produced significant SSEP changes. The reduction of rotation to 40 degrees resulted in tibial but not peroneal SSEP recovery. Peroneal nerve deficit was noted postoperatively. The second patient showed substantial SSEP attenuation after 45 degrees correction of distal tibial valgus. However, spontaneous recovery of the response occurred, which allowed maintenance of the achieved correction. In a third patient, significant SSEP changes occurred after 90 degrees external rotation and 10 mm medial translation of the distal femur. Total release of translation allowed 75 degrees external rotation without SSEP abnormalities. Neither of the latter two patients had peripheral nerve deficits postoperatively. Intraoperative SSEP monitoring thus helps to define a neurologically safe limit of acute deformity correction.

### Staged correction of severe recurrent clubfoot deformity with dislocation of the chopart joint using a hexapod external fixator and unconventional arthrodesis [^111iWB7P]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Talipes equinovarus, also known as clubfoot, is a congenital deformity of the lower limb marked by varus and equinus in the hindfoot, cavus in the midfoot, and adduction in the forefoot. Clubfoot has a prevalence between 1 and 2 per 1,000 births, making it one of the most common musculoskeletal birth defects. The exact pathogenesis of clubfoot has yet to be discovered, although it is generally thought to have polygenic and environmental components. An untreated clubfoot causes pain and disability with a potential to reduce quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Thus, early diagnosis and intervention of clubfoot is imperative. Available treatments for clubfoot include the Ponseti method, French method, soft-tissue procedures, osteotomies, and use of external fixators in the most resistant cases. Although the current trend in contemporary clinical practice is to correct severe clubfoot deformity using external fixation, Radler and Mindlerdemonstrated the importance of a case-by-case analysis for unique pathoanatomy in successfully treating clubfoot deformity.

In this case, bilateral clubfoot was initially treated with the Ponseti method. This method is the standard treatment of congenital clubfoot with excellent outcomes, although it does have a potential for recurrence due in part to patient noncompliance. In our patient, Chopart joint dislocation was noted at the time of his presentation in adolescence. This may have been related to excessive release or overcorrection of the clubfoot, although this conclusion was not entirely corroborated because of unavailability of surgical records and inability of the family to provide sufficient details regarding surgical treatment. Correction of these deformities required an unconventional approach, including staged surgical intervention, joint distraction, bone resection, and joint fusion.

The patient was informed that data concerning this case would be submitted for publication, and he provided consent.

### The importance of having a single, dedicated medical team to treat congenital talipes equinovarus using the ponseti method: a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes after 3 years of follow-up [^115gJ31L]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

From 2013 onwards (period II), casting was accompanied by relaxing music to keep the infant as calm as possible during the intervention, and minimal pressure was applied to the foot so as not to disturb it.

After the casting phase comes the bracing phase, where a foot abduction brace (FAB) keeps the foot (or feet) in the corrected position. FAB holds the feet in external rotation and dorsiflexion. This should be worn continuously for 3 months, even at night. Then, it should be worn at least 10 to 12 hours per night until the age of 4 to 6 years old. This brace-wearing time instructions were the same for both period I and period II. The bracing phase is a critical component of the Ponseti method, with noncompliance or failure to wear the brace being reported as one of the most significant factors for treatment failure.

During period I, our hospital used the traditional Denis Browne bar FAB (which includes pre-walking shoes attached to a rigid metallic bar). From 2013 onwards (period II), it used a Mitchell brace (which includes detachable shoes, soft silicone and rigid metallic bar, ankle–foot orthosis-type inserts). During this period, the dedicated medical team also emphasized to patients' families how important the correct use of the brace was to reduce the brace noncompliance rate.

### Surgical management of Charcot neuroarthropathy of the ankle and hindfoot in patients with diabetes [^116VUiuw]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) of the ankle and hindfoot (Sanders/Frykberg Type IV) is challenging to treat surgically or nonsurgically. The deformities associated with ankle/hindfoot CN are often multiplanar, resulting in sagittal, frontal and rotational malalignment. In addition, shortening of the limb often occurs from collapse of the distal tibia, talus and calcaneus. These deformities also result in significant alterations in the biomechanics of the foot. For example, a varus ankle/hindfoot results in increased lateral column plantar pressure of the foot, predisposing the patient to lateral foot ulceration. Collapse of the talus, secondary to avascular necrosis or neuropathic fracture, further accentuates these deformities and contributes to a limb-length inequality.

Surgical Management

The primary indication for surgical reconstruction is a nonbraceable deformity associated with instability. Other indications include impending ulceration, inability to heal an ulcer, recurrent ulcers, presence of osteomyelitis and/or significant pain. Arthrodesis of the ankle and/or hindfoot is the method of choice when surgically correcting CN deformities in this region. The choice of fixation (i.e. internal or external fixation) depends on largely on the presence or absence of active infection and bone quality.

Conclusion

Surgical reconstruction of ankle and hindfoot CN is associated with a high rate of infectious and noninfectious complications. Despite this high complication rate, surgeons embarking on surgical reconstruction of ankle and hindfoot CN should strive for limb salvage rates approximating 90%. Preoperative measures that can improve outcomes include assessment of vascular status, optimization of glycemic control, correction of vitamin D deficiency and cessation of tobacco use.

### Correcting severe relapsed hallux varus using hexapod circular external fixator [^112tbcaV]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention

A "butt-frame" configuration hexapod circular external fixator was used with one full ring over the forefoot and a "U-plate full ring" block was mounted to the hindfoot and tibia. One (size 3 mm) Schanz pin was inserted in the first metatarsal head parallel to the first metatarsal distal articular surface; then through a small dorsal stab wound, the osteotomy site was marked (a distal subcapital osteotomy, made parallel to the pin) and then predrilled using a 2-mm Kirschner wire and finally completed with a small osteotome. The pin was fixed to the forefoot ring so that it is mounted orthogonally to the big toe in the frontal plane (Figure 4). A 2-mm Kirschner wire was used to stabilize the interphalangeal joint and metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and was fixed to the ring so that the ring is orthogonal to the big toe in the sagittal plane. The proximal ring was fixed to the calcaneus using two olive wires and to the tibia with two olive wires. The distal ring was the reference ring, and mounting parameters were taken. The rings were then connected using six struts. On the fifth postoperative day, distraction was initiated at a rate of 0.5 mm/day. The osteotomy site was lengthened by 10 mm and extended to help correct the big toe clawing, and medial translation was done to create a "reverse-Chevron" effect at the osteotomy site (Figure 5).

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of using the hexapod circular external fixator to correct severe congenital hallux varus associated with soft-tissue contracture. The case suggests that in the setting of soft-tissue contracture and severe three-dimensional deformity with shortening, the hexapod external fixator may be a useful tool for correction as a salvage procedure instead of joint fusion, especially for young active patients.

### Congenital vertical talus: etiology and management [^1143A79K]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Congenital vertical talus is a rare foot deformity. If left untreated, it causes significant disability, including pain and functional limitations. Although the etiology of vertical talus is likely heterogeneous, recent evidence strongly supports a genetic cause linking it to genes expressed during early limb development. Traditional management for vertical talus involves extensive surgeries that are associated with significant short- and long-term complications. A minimally invasive approach that relies on serial manipulation and casting to achieve most of the correction has been shown to produce excellent short-term results with regard to clinical and radiographic correction in both isolated and nonisolated cases of vertical talus. Although long-term studies are needed, achieving correction without extensive surgery may lead to more flexible and functional feet, much as Ponseti method has done for clubfeet.

### Avoiding compartment syndrome, vascular injury, and neurologic deficit in tibial osteotomy: an observational study of 108 limbs [^112Nd2vV]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There are other arterial safety considerations. Acute shortening can kink arteries, at or before 4 cm; in such situations, frequent pulse checks are important. Acute angular or rotational correction can also constrict arteries, which can present as a secondary neurologic dysfunction. Vessel injury from sudden position change on osteotomy completioncan be prevented by supporting the extremity above and below. External fixation can achieve gradual correction, either during surgery or subsequently, preventing vessel kinking. The fixator can remain for the duration of healing or can be exchanged for a plate or a nail.

Nerve injuries are a third major potential complication. The bulk of nerve injuries are also reported regarding HTO, as an acute varus correction of valgus deformity stretches the common peroneal nerve. Any stretch either acutely or during the course of correction can induce a nerve palsy. Nerve protection principles are similar to arterial principles, with the following fundamentals optimizing safety. Peroneal nerve release about the fibular headcan be performed prophylactically or therapeutically. Our group's main indication for peroneal nerve decompression is acute correction of valgus and/or external torsion in the diaphysis or metadiaphysis. The tibial nerve is most often stressed distally after correction of ankle varus, equinus and/or procurvatum, and in lengthening situations. Prophylactic or therapeutic release of the entire tarsal tunnelis beneficial, especially if acute bony correction induces equinus, prompting tendoachilles lengthening or gastrocnemius-soleus complex recession. Our group's main indication for tibial nerve decompression via a tarsal tunnel release is the acute correction of varus and/or internal torsion in the distal metaphysis or metadiaphysis. It deserves specifically reiterating that an apparent neurologic deficit may actually be because of a primary arterial compromise.

### Radiology… [^112YHC4S]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Other muscles serve to perform hip adduction, abduction, and internal and external rotation. It is helpful to have a clinical anatomy reference handy when evaluating sport injuries in order to more readily identify specific muscle or tendon injuries. Pain on passive stretching or active motion in a particular direction will often help to identify an injury. Falls onto the lateral hip and overuse injuries are the most common causes of trochanteric bursitis. After passing over the greater trochanter, the iliotibial band inserts at the knee on the lateral aspect of the tibia, so patients with iliotibial band syndrome may also complain of lateral knee pain. Steroid injection into the trochanteric bursa may be helpful in addition to icing, anti-inflammatory medication and avoidance of excessive training or overuse. Observation. A limited functional evaluation includes determining whether the affected leg can bear weight.

If it can, important points to observe include the patient's posture, gait and ability to transfer independently from standing to sitting to lying down, and then back to standing. If the patient is able to stand erect, the examiner can estimate the height symmetry of the iliac crests by resting his or her hands on the iliac wings. If the crests are asymmetric or the patient is unable to stand, the next step is to compare leg lengths: the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial malleolus of each leg. Range of Motion. Normal ranges of motion are dependent on the patient's stage of skeletal development, with the range tending to decrease as age increases. Decreased range of motion on the side of the affected hip should heighten the suspicion of an underlying injury. Specific injuries may be suggested by certain defects in range of motion. 8 Passive and active motion should be assessed — that is, motion produced by the examiner and by the patient.

Abduction and adduction are best tested with the patient supine and the examiner providing resistance against the medial and lateral side of the knee. Extension strength is best tested with the patient prone and the examiner applying resistance against the lower leg. While the piriformis is an external rotator of the hip, it is best tested with the patient supine. Patients with the piriformis syndrome will have pain with passive internal rotation and palpation of the sciatic notch, as well as with active external rotation.

### Treatment of arthrogrypotic foot deformities with the Taylor spatial frame [^117RWs5F]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of foot deformities in arthrogryposis is a challenging problem. Most deformities are very rigid clubfeet, such as deformities with severe equinus, supination, cavus, hindfoot varus, and forefoot adduction. Vertical talus with severe rocker bottom is also common. Traditional approaches included casting and soft tissue release, which are usually only partially successful. We describe our experience with the treatment of arthrogrypotic foot deformities with the Taylor Spatial Frame.

Methods

Over a period of 5 years, we treated 7 patients (10 feet) with various arthrogrypotic foot deformities. There were 4 girls and 3 boys with a mean age 10.6 years (range: 4 to 16 y). Six patients had clubfoot deformities and 1 had vertical talus. All patients had previous surgeries, including soft tissue release in 8 feet and Ilizarov correction in 3 feet. Three patients underwent bilateral correction, 3 patients underwent midfoot osteotomies, and 2 patients had supramalleolar osteotomies and lengthening to compensate for growth arrest of the distal tibia. The remaining feet had correction of their deformities by soft tissue distraction. Six patients underwent correction using a Butt frame and 5 by standard frame configuration.

Results

All patients achieved the preoperative correction goal and their frames were removed at an average of 16.1 weeks (range: 14 to 18 wk). Complications included pin tract infections in 4 patients. One patient had iatrogenic regenerate translation that was reduced by a residual program, 1 patient had recurrence of equines, and another had partial recurrence of forefoot supination. Two hindfoot varus deformities were successfully treated by calcaneal osteotomy at the time of Butt frame removal.

Conclusions

On the basis of our preliminary experience, we believe that the Taylor Spatial Frame is a reliable and accurate method of correction of complex foot deformities in children with arthrogryposis.

### Staged correction of severe recurrent clubfoot deformity with dislocation of the chopart joint using a hexapod external fixator and unconventional arthrodesis [^114KyrrW]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite success of the Ponseti method, a subset of patients with clubfeet experience residual deformity. Surgical release after unsuccessful serial casting can lead to residual clubfoot deformities, including a flat-top talus. We present a case of a 17-year-old boy with a dysmorphic ankle and a complete dorsal dislocation of the Chopart joint. Because of pain with activities and functional limitations, the patient underwent a staged correction of the dislocation. The deformity was corrected through a staged approach using a Taylor Spatial Frame, navicular excision, talocuneiform arthrodesis, and calcaneocuboid arthrodesis. One year postoperatively, the patient is pain free with notable functional gains.

### Midterm follow-up of talectomy for severe rigid equinovarus feet [^115uiL7B]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Rigid equinovarus foot is a challenging problem. Talectomy has been advocated as a salvage procedure to achieve a plantigrade painless foot in the treatment of rigid equinovarus deformity. The present prospective observational study evaluated the effectiveness of talectomy in the treatment of Dimeglio grade IV rigid equinovarus feet. Nineteen feet in 13 patients were treated by talectomy from September 2001 through January 2012 (10-year, 2-month period). Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.23%) had a foot deformity due to arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and 1 (7.69%) each due to sacral agenesis, spastic cerebral palsy, neglected congenital talipes equinovarus, and post-traumatic contracture. Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.23%) were male and 4 (30.77%) were female. Their mean age was 7.7 (range 3 to 26) years. The mean follow-up duration was 6.4 (range 2 to 11) years. Along with talectomy, excision of the navicular was performed in 8 feet (42.11%), calcaneal osteotomy with a laterally based wedge in 8 (42.11%), and calcaneocuboid fusion in 3 feet (15.79%). Postoperatively, all the feet improved to Dimeglio grade II and were painless, and 16 feet (84.22%) were plantigrade; 1 foot (5.26%) had residual equinus resulting from incomplete removal of the talus and 2 (10.53%) had residual varus. Also, 3 feet (15.79%) had forefoot adduction (2 residual and 1 recurrent) that required a second surgery to correct the deformity. From our experience, talectomy is an effective procedure for correction of severe rigid equinovarus feet, provided that the talus is completely removed and the calcaneus is positioned correctly in the ankle mortise.

### Late effects of clubfoot deformity in adolescent and young adult patients whose initial treatment was an extensive soft-tissue release: topic review and clinical case series [^112ECquc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Only through careful history and physical examination can the surgeon determine the primary reasons for pain in the adolescent clubfoot because radiographically many of the feet have significant abnormalities but often function at a high level despite their radiographic deformity.

The primary goal of the treatment is to obtain a plantigrade foot through osteotomies, soft-tissue balancing, and gradual distraction with external fixation or arthrodesis and not necessarily correct all abnormal radiographic angles and joint alignments. The second goal is to eliminate sources of pain which are often related to asymmetrical loading of a nonplantigrade foot or bony prominences, or painful arthritic joints. A third goal is to maintain as much functional range of motion as possible, given the significant stiffness that is often observed at the time of presentation. Therefore, periarticular osteotomies and soft-tissue balancing procedures are favored over arthrodesis with the goal to maintain range of motion at the primary joints of the foot and ankle. Given the varied presentations of these patients, a wide spectrum of different surgical procedures are required to manage the presenting problems as evidenced by the listing of procedures in Appendices 1–5.

Pes cavus is a multiplanar deformity that involves the 3 foot-joint complexes. Description of the deformity is not well standardized and the surgical management does not have a comprehensive algorithm to follow. Treatment should be tailored to the patient's requirements, foot condition, and the potential for future progression of the deformity. This study describes a heterogeneous group of patients treated surgically and followed for 5 to 28 years. The benefits and risks are discussed, together with pitfalls encountered.

Syndesmotic sprains and cuboid syndrome — diagnostic features and risk: Syndesmotic sprains and cuboid syndrome have been described in 2 separate case series. Diagnosis and grading of a syndesmosis sprain include assessment of pain and extent of edema between the distal tibia/fibula and posteromedial ankle regions, and palpation, external rotation, squeeze, and dorsiflexion-compression tests can be used for diagnosis and prognosis. Female dancers with hyperpronated feet have been reported to be at the greatest risk for developing cuboid syndrome, which often presents with pain and localized swelling on the dorsolateral foot adjacent to the cuboid; those affected may also have limited weight-bearing ability and a positive midtarsal adduction test.

### Correcting severe relapsed hallux varus using hexapod circular external fixator [^114wCDc3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recurrent hallux varus is a difficult condition to treat because of the disrupted anatomy from a previous surgery. The deformity is three-dimensional and may be very severe, with a need to lengthen a short first metatarsal. Fusion surgery of the first metatarsophalangeal joint has been suggested to treat these severe conditions, but it becomes challenging when there is an associated soft-tissue envelope deficiency or contractures or scar formation tendency, which poses a recurrence risk.

Hexapod circular external fixator has been used to correct complex foot deformitiesbecause of its versatility and its ability to gradually lengthen bone and soft tissues. For good preoperative planning, it is important to understand the three-dimensional nature of hallux varus deformity. It is also very important that the surgeon is familiar with the use of the hexapod fixator. It is crucial to properly counsel patients about the slow process of using hexapods and the slower recovery compared with joint fusion surgery, emphasizing the importance of patient compliance. If properly executed, deformity correction using a hexapod circular fixator may offer an alternative to fusion for young patients seeking joint preservation surgery. It is crucial to carefully select patients and educate them about the potential risks of acute correction, which could lead to neurovascular compromise; gradual correction could be a safer option for these patients.

### Obtaining correct ankle alignment using intraoperative external fixation for ankle arthrodesis [^1143drJu]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Ankle arthrodesis remains an important treatment option for patients with ankle arthritis. Many methods have been described; however, no consensus has been reached regarding the best technique to achieve both successful fusion and a good position for optimal foot mechanics. Furthermore, as arthroplasty has become more popular, preservation of the fibula to allow for future arthroplasty has become critical. The present report describes an innovative technique in which temporary external fixation at operative fixation is used, along with internal fixation, to achieve both an optimal foot position and high fusion rates, while maintaining the integrity of the fibula. Seventeen patients were identified who met the criteria for inclusion. Their medical records, including pre- and postoperative radiographs, were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative and postoperative coronal and sagittal alignment was determined. All patients achieved successful fusion, although 1 (5.9%) patient experienced delayed union. The average tibial/talar ratio preoperatively was 21% (range 8% to 33%), demonstrating anterior subluxation. Postoperatively, this ratio improved to 33% (range 26% to 40%), approximating the normal anatomic ratio. Of the 17 patients, 5 (29.4%) had preoperative varus or valgus alignment of the talas > 5°. All 5 cases were successfully corrected to within 2° of normal anatomic alignment. This technique allows the surgeon to achieve good visualization of the joint for preparation and to obtain the optimal position of the foot at arthrodesis without compromising the lateral column significance of the fibula. All patients obtained fusion, and minimal complications were associated with the use of this technique.

### The treatment of intra-articular calcaneus fractures with severe soft tissue damage with a hinged external fixator or internal stabilization: long-term results [^116K9QZa]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We developed a hinged external fixator for the treatment of dislocated intra-articular calcaneus fractures with severe soft tissue damage. The external fixation was performed with a known external fixator system. The screw insertion points were biomechanically tested by defining a virtual rotation axis through the center of the talus to allow early active motion in the ankle joint. Long-term follow-up was performed after an average of 7.3 years. Results were graded with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Radiographs were reviewed according to Sanders classification. Four open fractures and 33 cases with extremely swollen soft tissue, blisters, or compartment syndromes were treated. In 24 cases (64.9%), the hinged fixator was the final method of treatment (group I). A change to open reduction with internal fixation was performed in 13 fractures (35.1%) when soft tissue problems were minimal (group II). There were no late amputations, osteomyelitis, or malunions. According to Sanders classification, group I consisted of 14 type II, 8 type III, and 2 type IV fractures. Pin loosening or pin infection was seen in 4 cases, but there was no redislocation. The Böhler's angle improved in 43%, gaps in the posterior facet were closed in 41%, and any shortening or deviation of the axis was corrected in 82% of the cases. The AOFAS score for the group averaged 66.5. According to Sanders classification, group II consisted of 8 type II and 5 type III fractures. The Böhler's angle improved in 88%, and gaps in the posterior facet were closed in 87%. Any shortening or deviation of the axis was corrected in 95%, and the AOFAS score averaged 61.3. Significant differences in patient outcome scores between open reduction with internal fixation and hinged fixator were not found. P value was > .05. The hinged external fixator frame can be used in all calcaneus fracture types without soft tissue limitation. The hinged fixator allows early movement in the ankle joint, the risk of infection is minimized, and secondary plate fixation remains possible.

### Clubfoot treatment: ponseti and French functional methods are equally effective [^113Cj1wq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Over the past 15 years, the reemergence of nonoperative treatment of clubfeet throughout the world has been profound. Two methods have been utilized-the Ponseti method and, to a lesser extent, the French functional method. Our review presents one institution's experience using both methods. Satisfactory initial correction was achieved in 95% of idiopathic clubfeet, regardless of method. However, maintenance of the correction was challenging as relapses occurred in 37% of feet treated by the Ponseti method and 29% of feet treated by the French functional method. At an average 4.3 year followup, using either method, posteromedial releases were avoided in 84% of our patients. Using gait analysis to evaluate the function of children treated with these techniques, there was no difference in cadence parameters between the two groups. More of the children treated with the French method walked with knee hyperextension, a mild equinus gait, and mild footdrop. In contrast, more of the patients in the Ponseti group demonstrated mildly increased stance-phase dorsiflexion and a calcaneus gait.

### Torsional malalignment syndrome: the hidden role of medial tibial slope in knee varus and the potential of PETS treatment for correction [^116DLawL]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In torsional malalignment syndrome (TMS), knee varus is observed when feet are neutral but disappears with external foot rotation. The underlying cause of this phenomenon-whether it results from visual alterations from limb rotation or reflects an additional structural abnormality in the lower extremity-along with the potential for simpler treatment options beyond rotational osteotomy, has not been previously investigated.

Methods

Eighteen subjects with TMS and ten control subjects had weight-bearing orthoroentgenograms and non-weight-bearing 3D CT scans of the lower limb. Mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) were measured. Changes in the mechanical axis during femoral rotation were analyzed with 2D and 3D CT images processed with Adobe Photoshop and PowerPoint. Morphologies of the distal femur and proximal tibia were evaluated. Six subjects received guided growth with percutaneous epiphysiodesis transphyseal screws (PETS).

Results

TMS subjects showed significantly greater mLDFA and knee varus on weight-bearing radiographs, but not on 3D CT, indicating that weight-bearing contributes to the varus appearance. Although external rotation on 3D CT caused medial axis shift and mLDFA reduction in both groups, the degree of change in TMS subjects was similar to controls and insufficient to explain the pronounced varus, implying an additional structural abnormality. While femoral contours appeared normal, TMS subjects exhibited a significantly steeper posterior slope of the medial tibial plateau-averaging 7.0 degrees more than the lateral slope and also significantly steeper than in controls. In patients treated with PETS, the mean mLDFA improved from 90.2 to 88.1 degrees, and all reported cosmetic satisfaction, with no deterioration in LEFS or TLKSS scores.

Conclusions

A steeper posterior slope of the medial tibial plateau likely contributes to knee varus in TMS subjects when feet are neutral. Although PETS doesn't address the underlying rotational deformity, it improved coronal alignment and appearance in selected patients without functional compromise, offering a simple and cosmetically effective treatment alternative.

### The importance of having a single, dedicated medical team to treat congenital talipes equinovarus using the ponseti method: a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes after 3 years of follow-up [^112mpqyv]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Data Collection

A single researcher retrospectively retrieved data from the medical charts of children with CTEV who had been treated in our hospital using the Ponseti method from 2007 to 2018. The patient characteristics assessed at baseline were sex, positive family history of CTEV, perinatal complications, the extremity involved, and the severity of the deformity. The severity of CTEV at birth was assessed using the Dimeglio score, which is classified as mild (I: score of < 5 points), moderate (II: score ≥ 5 and < 10 points), severe (III: score ≥ 10 and < 15 points), or very severe (IV: score ≥ 15 points).

The outcomes recorded during the casting phase were the age at the first cast, the number of casts used, the number of complications (eg, skin infection, cast slippage, cast intolerance, erythema, pain, a wet cast, skin breakdown, swollen toes, the subject physically kicking off the cast), and the numbers of cast revisions and re-casts needed. The outcomes recorded during the bracing phase were the number of brace complications (eg, pain, bedsores, poor tolerance), noncompliance with treatment recommendations, and premature removal of the brace (before 3 y old).

Any additional treatments needed during the 3 years of follow-up (eg, tenotomy, tibialis anterior transfer, Achilles tendon relengthening, posterior release) were also reported.

Finally, the outcomes recorded after 3 years of follow-up were relapsed foot, the external rotation and dorsiflexion angles, any physical limitations to the child's activities (subjectively evaluated by their parents), any requirements for physiotherapy, and the presence of a complex foot deformity or leg-length inequality.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of treatment failures with relapsed feet (inability to maintain a plantigrade position) after 3 years of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the numbers of minor and major recurrences defined according to the method described by Carry et al. Minor recurrences were defined as any recurrences resulting in deviations from the routine follow-up protocol, including repeat casting, revision tenotomy, and tibialis anterior tendon transfer. Major recurrences were defined as any recurrence requiring extensive soft-tissue release surgery or bone procedures that went beyond repeat tenotomy and/or tendon transfers.

### Plantar opening-wedge osteotomy of cuneiform bones combined with selective plantar release and dwyer osteotomy for pes cavovarus in children [^112f84Dm]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2006). Low credibility.

Neurological pes cavovarus is a challenging deformity to treat during childhood. Based on physiopathology, we propose the following original surgical procedure. Plantar-opening wedge osteotomy of the three cuneiform bones, preceded by selective plantar release, corrects forefoot pronation which is the primum movens of the deformity, and corrects the cavus at its apex. A calcaneal valgisation closing wedge osteotomy, is indicated if pre-operative planning revealed subtalar joint stiffness, incompatible with secondary hind foot realignment in valgus. The follow-up had to be at least 5 years or to reach skeletal maturity. Twenty-six children (36 feet) satisfied these criteria. Mean age at surgery was 10.3 years old. All the children had a neurological disease which was progressive for 65% of them (75% of the feet). Mean follow-up was 6.9 years. This treatment was effective, with a mean percentage of cavus correction of 74%, reaching 100% for 31% of the feet. Complete or partial cavus correction was still observed at last follow-up for 75% of the feet. At last follow-up, global result was satisfactory in 63.9% and non satisfactory in 36.1% of feet. Flat-foot was observed, of minor type, in only 2 cases. Apart from triple arthrodesis, iterative surgery relative to residual deformity (foot adduction, plantar sticking of the first metatarsal head) was indicated for 4 feet (11%). A triple arthrodesis was required in 12 cases (33%). In conclusion, this treatment provides mid-term satisfactory correction of the cavus and may allow avoiding triple arthrodesis at skeletal maturity.

### Long-term retrospective study of patients with idiopathic clubfoot treated with posterior medial-lateral release [^112oJoHu]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It has been demonstrated that an important component of clubfoot deformity is related to pathologic external rotation of the talus with respect to the remainder of the foot. The purpose of the present study was to review the long-term results for a cohort of patients with idiopathic clubfoot who were managed by a single surgeon with a uniform surgical protocol consisting of extensive posterior medial-lateral release in addition to the use of a temporary Kirschner wire to derotate the talus prior to fixation.

Methods

Eighty patients (120 clubfeet) with idiopathic clubfoot without previous surgery were managed with posterior medial-lateral release. At an average of twenty-one years postoperatively, patients underwent a detailed physical examination and completed four quality-of-life surveys (the Short Form-36, the Laaveg and Ponseti scale, the Foot Function Index, and the modified Atar scale).

Results

Thirty-two clubfeet (27%) had required additional procedures at the time of follow-up, with only one patient requiring complete revision posterior medial-lateral release and none requiring subtalar or triple arthrodesis. In patients with unilateral clubfoot, clinical examination demonstrated a significant decrease in the range of motion (p < 0.001), foot length (p = 0.045), and calf circumference (p = 0.008) on the affected side as compared with the unaffected, contralateral side. The results on all four quality-of-life scales remained durable, with no decline in relation to the time from the index procedure (p ≥ 0.48). Significantly worse scores were found for patients who required additional surgical procedures (p ≤ 0.03).

Conclusions

Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent long-term results following the treatment of clubfoot with extensive soft-tissue releases. With our technique, thirty-two clubfeet (27%) required additional procedures and only one clubfoot required revision posterior medial-lateral release. We demonstrate that our technique, which involves aggressive posterior medial-lateral soft-tissue release in addition to manual derotation of the talus with a Kirschner wire to correct pathologic external rotation, produces acceptable results.

### An unusual aberrant muscle in congenital clubfoot: an intraoperative finding [^114Akjtw]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital clubfoot is a common congenital deformity, characterized by equinus of the hindfoot and adduction of the midfoot and forefoot, with varus through the subtalar joint complex. A cavus deformity will also be present. The etiology of this congenital deformity remains elusive. Muscle anomalies are not commonly found in patients with idiopathic clubfoot, and, when present, their significance is not clear. The presence of a flexor digitorum accessorius longus muscle and an accessory soleus muscle found at surgical correction of clubfoot deformity has been previously reported. Our case was a female child, aged 2 years, 3 months, who developed bilateral relapsed congenital clubfoot. She was found to have an unusual aberrant muscle in both legs. This was discovered accidentally during surgical correction of her deformity through posteromedial soft tissue release. This muscle might have contributed to the hindfoot varus and equinus in the clubfoot deformity, because the latter were completely corrected after release of the muscle from its insertion. Awareness of such a new anatomic variant, with the other anatomic variants found in clubfoot deformity, will not only improve our understanding of normal lower limb development, but could also lead to improved genetic counseling and diagnostic and treatment methods of such a common congenital deformity.

### Casting is effective for recurrence following ponseti treatment of clubfoot [^115Hk4wb]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic clubfoot, a congenital defect with a prevalence of 0.64 to 6.8 per 1,000 births, is characterized by fixed equinus and hindfoot varus with inversion and adduction of the midfoot and forefoot. Without correction, clubfoot leads to substantial deformity and disability.

The Ponseti method has become the standard treatment for the correction of idiopathic clubfoot. This primarily noninvasive method has excellent long-term outcomes, with < 5% of patients requiring extensive surgical intervention. The result of this treatment has been reported to be superior to extensive surgical release with respect to deformity correction, reduced risk of overcorrection, and improved functional outcome. After initial successful treatment with the Ponseti method, however, up to 40% of patients experience recurrence. Possible causes for recurrence include the intrinsic contractile nature of the soft tissues in clubfoot deformity, genetic and neuromuscular factors, casting techniques, different designs of braces, and variable brace wear time due to parental nonadherence. Currently, many children with recurrence receive an anterior tibial tendon transfer as a primary approach to treat the relapse.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes for patients with idiopathic clubfoot who were treated with repeat casting and bracing for recurrent clubfoot after initial correction with successful Ponseti treatment.

### The effect of tibial rotation on varus deformity measurement [^111LG8mX]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tibial osteotomy is used to treat a variety of orthopedic conditions, including reduction in pain and improvement of deformity and function. In templating for surgery, accurate radiographic measurement aids in planning for correction. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of internal rotation and external rotation on measurement of tibial sawbone models with 5 closing wedge varus deformities at 10-degree increments between 10 and 50 degrees. One sawbone without deformity served as the control.

A total of 66 radiographs were measured by 5 individuals. Measurement deviations from the control in each of the 10 positions of rotation were assessed.

Results

In the analysis of variance models, increased rotation and varus angulation were associated with increased deviation compared with the control. In external rotation for every 10 degrees of varus angulation, the degree deviation increased 0.69 degrees. In IR for every 10 degrees of angulation, the degree deviation increased by 0.84 degrees. Internal rotation had the greatest impact. Mean differences between different rater's measurements were small (1.1 ± 1.2 degrees) and correlations suggested high interrater reliability.

Conclusions

As the degree of rotation from neutral increased and varus angulation increased, deviation from neutral increased.

Clinical Relevance

Clinically, the results of this study support the importance of proper alignment of the tibia during radiography to more precisely template surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^111H6SuX]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Musculoskeletal physical examination — children and adolescents with obesity — includes gait abnormality described as collapse into hip ("waddle"), Trendelenburg or antalgic gait with external rotation or out-toeing on the affected side, with differentials including arthritis and SCFE. Lordosis is defined as trunk sway associated with postural adaptations with differentials including spondylolisthesis, achondroplasia, muscular dystrophy, and other genetic conditions. Hip pain and/or limp is characterized by knee or hip pain, subacute onset, and pain with external rotation of the hip; other causes of chronic hip, knee, or thigh pain include slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) among multiple conditions. Alignment abnormalities include genu varum (bow legs) and genu valgum (knock-kneed), with differentials such as tibia vara (Blount disease), rickets, skeletal dysplasia, celiac sprue, and collagen disorder and hypermobility syndromes (eg, Marfan syndrome). Foot posture findings can include pes planus, described as rigid versus flexible, sometimes with pain, with differentials including posterior tibial tendon insufficiency, tarsal coalition, congenital vertical talus, rheumatoid arthritides, trauma, and neuropathy.

### Effectiveness of a digital-based gradual exercise training program for preventing relapse in congenital clubfoot: a protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial [^1135EBaT]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital clubfoot (CCF) is a common congenital musculoskeletal disorder characterized by skeletal deformity, congenital neuromuscular imbalance, with a global incidence of approximately 1 in 1,000 live births. This deformity of the foot involves the hindfoot equinus and varus, midfoot supination and cavus, and forefoot adductus. It is imperative to reconstruct the anatomy and biomechanics of the affected foot after birth among children with CCF. The Ponseti method has emerged as the preferred treatment for correcting anatomical deformities in infants with CCF shortly after birth. The Ponseti method involves a series of manipulations and serial casting, along with an Achilles tenotomy. After the casting phase, a foot abduction orthosis (FAO) is used to oppose the deforming forces at the medial ankle–foot joints until the child reaches five years old, helping to maintain deformity correction.

Despite the effects of good initial treatment, there is a high probability of further recurrence before skeletal maturity. It has been reported that the relapse rate following treatment with the Ponseti method ranges from 26% to 37%, with repeated relapses occurring in 14% of cases. Patients with recurrent clubfoot may experience pain and functional limitations, manifesting as difficulties in walking long distances and squatting, which adversely affect the daily activities of patients. Additionally, changes in foot appearance can negatively affect social interactions and self-image, while foot deformities have emerged as a significant concern for parents. A multicenter study showed that the group of patients with relapses exhibits poorer clinical outcomes and quality of life. Guidelines recommended that treatment approaches for relapsed CCF include recasting and revision tenotomy. However, even if the ankle and foot structure of patients is restored postoperatively, the function of the ankle and foot may still not be recovered due to stiffness and insufficient neuromuscular control. This significantly reduces the child's participation in daily activities and increases the burden on caregivers.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^115BSQs3]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Lower limb deformities can be treated by performing osteotomies at the site or sites of major deformity and correcting in all three planes. The osteotomy could result in acute correction of the deformity with internal fixation or gradual correction of deformity using external fixation techniques. Such surgery is associated with notable rates of recurrence and of complications, especially in young children and in patients with poor metabolic control. In one study, 57% patients (28 of 49) experienced at least one complication of surgery, with recurrent deformity in 29% of patients. Therefore, delaying surgical treatment for residual deformity until skeletal maturity might be prudent. Rarely, major deformities can induce severe knee instability, and these patients should undergo osteotomies before they stop growing.

Guided growth techniques have been gaining popularity. This surgical strategy should commence early after 12 months if deformity persists despite maximized medical therapy. The rationale for this therapy is to correct the deformity at the physis before significant diaphyseal deformity develops. With correction of the mechanical axis, the forces directed across the physes and the joints are normalized, thus promoting normal growth. This technique does not require immobilization. The limitation of this strategy is that it provides only uniplanar coronal correction without correction of the tibial medial torsion. Torsional alignment often improves simultaneously. Both varus and valgus deformities correct readily and rapidly, but genu varum might respond less in adolescents. In growing children, guided growth techniques might lead to overcorrection if the plates are left in situ for too long. Rebound deformity after plate removal has been reported, although rarely.

Whether or not deformity correction at the knee results in some correction distally at the ankle is debated. If early treatment could reduce deformity at distal joints, then the overall requirement for surgical procedures might be reduced. Similarly, if the limb alignment overall is satisfactory and the joints are horizontal, it is unclear as to whether residual minor diaphyseal deformity or torsional deformity causes significant functional difficulties.

Assessment of surgical outcomes

Postoperative assessment of the axis correction should be documented at 12 months. Functional assessment should be performed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Function using tools such as the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) or the 6MWT. As patients transition to adult services, a full orthopaedic clinical and radiographic assessment enables definition of any residual deformity and facilitates appropriate follow-up arrangements.

Tailor's bunion — surgical indications and procedures: Surgical treatment is indicated for patients who have failed nonsurgical care and patients who are not candidates for nonsurgical care, and the goal is to decrease the prominence of the fifth metatarsal laterally. Selection of procedure is based on physical evaluation and radiographic assessment, surgical correction varies from exostectomy to differing types of osteotomies, and resection of the fifth metatarsal head generally is indicated for salvage conditions or in the presence of unreconstructable deformities; Tailor's bunion deformity generally is addressed with some type of osteotomy. The deformity is described as inherited and progressive, and although nonsurgical measures may be used initially to reduce symptomatology, surgical repair is often necessary.

### Update on clubfoot: etiology and treatment [^111Z4sng]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Although clubfoot is one of the most common congenital abnormalities affecting the lower limb, it remains a challenge not only to understand its genetic origins but also to provide effective long-term treatment. This review provides an update on the etiology of clubfoot as well as current treatment strategies. Understanding the exact genetic etiology of clubfoot may eventually be helpful in determining both prognosis and the selection of appropriate treatment methods in individual patients. The primary treatment goal is to provide long-term correction with a foot that is fully functional and pain-free. To achieve this, a combination of approaches that applies the strengths of several methods (Ponseti method and French method) may be needed. Avoidance of extensive soft-tissue release operations in the primary treatment should be a priority, and the use of surgery for clubfoot correction should be limited to an "a la carte" mode and only after failed conservative methods.

### Correcting severe relapsed hallux varus using hexapod circular external fixator [^1146BM72]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital hallux varus is an unusual condition in which the big toe is medially angulated at the metatarsophalangeal joint. Different surgical methods have been described to correct it; however, there is always a risk of recurrence. The multiplanar nature of the deformity and the disrupted anatomy from a previous surgery make recurrent cases difficult to treat. A 16-year-old adolescent boy presented with a recurrent hallux varus deformity after a previous surgical correction. This case report describes its successful treatment using a hexapod circular external fixator as a salvage procedure.

### Angle and base of gait long leg axial and intraoperative simulated weightbearing long leg axial imaging to capture true frontal plane tibia to calcaneus alignment in valgus and varus deformities of the rearfoot and ankle [^1119zeoo]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The long leg axial view is primarily used to evaluate the frontal plane alignment of the calcaneus in relation to the long axis of the tibia when standing. This view allows both angular measurement and assessment for the apex of varus and valgus deformity of the rearfoot and ankle with clinical utility in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings. The frontal plane alignment of the calcaneus to the long axis of the tibia is rarely fixed in the varus or valgus position because of the inherent flexibility of the foot and ankle, which makes patient positioning critical to obtain accurate and reproducible images. Inconsistent patient positioning and imaging techniques are commonly encountered with the long leg axial view for a variety of reasons, including the lack of a standardized or validated protocol. This angle and base of gait imaging protocol involves positioning the patient to align the tibia with the long axis of the foot, which is represented by the second metatarsal. Non-weightbearing long leg axial imaging is commonly performed intraoperatively, which requires a modified patient positioning technique to capture simulated weightbearing long leg axial images. A case series is presented to demonstrate our angle and base of gait long leg axial and intraoperative simulated weightbearing long leg axial imaging protocols that can be applied throughout all phases of patient care for various foot and ankle conditions.

### Operative versus non-operative treatment for closed, displaced, intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus: randomised controlled trial [^114wcefk]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We carried out a pragmatic, multicentre, two arm, parallel group, assessor blinded randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or more, and able to give informed consent, with a recent (less than three weeks) closed, intra-articular, displaced (subtalar joint posterior facet displacement of at least 2 mm) calcaneal fracture. Exclusions were gross deformity of the hindfoot (which we called fibula impingement and defined as: such severe calcaneal varus that after healing patients would walk on the tip of the fibula; or such severe calcaneal valgus that the tip of the fibula was embedded in the lateral wall of the calcaneus), other serious leg injuries sufficient to affect outcome at two years, not fit for surgery, peripheral vascular disease, or inability to adhere to the trial procedures. We included patients with bilateral fractures unless one or both of the fractures met the exclusion criteria.

Recruitment and randomisation of participants

We recruited participants from 22 UK hospitals in 2007–09. All were regional referral centres for calcaneal fractures, and the surgeons were all recognised as specialists in the treatment of these injuries. The calcaneal fractures seen in the emergency department or referred to orthopaedic surgeons at each centre during the recruitment period were identified prospectively. To ensure identification of all eligible patients, we audited attendance at the emergency departments and the radiology records.

Surgeons in each centre identified potential participants, assessed eligibility, and graded each fracture into one of four types according to Sanders classification: 1 = non-displaced fractures (displacement < 2 mm); 2 = two-part or split fractures of the subtalar joint; 3 = three-part or split depression fractures; and 4 = four-part or highly comminuted articular fractures. Research associates approached eligible patients to explain the trial, supported by a DVD presentation. Patients who consented to participate were randomised 1:1 to receive operative or non-operative care, using a mimimisation algorithm for centre, smoking status, diabetes, bilaterality, and Sanders classification. Randomisation was by participant, so those with bilateral fractures were allocated the same treatment on both sides. A secure telephone randomisation service ensured allocation concealment. We collected baseline data before randomisation. All participants provided written informed consent.

### Correcting severe relapsed hallux varus using hexapod circular external fixator [^1175P4tZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Report

Patient Information

The patient is a 16-year-old adolescent boy who presented with a recurrent right hallux varus deformity. His surgical history included an open surgery to correct the deformity at the age of 1 year through soft-tissue release only (Figure 1) through a medial approach. He presented to our service with deformity and an inability to wear regular shoes.

Figure 1
Radiographs of original hallux varus deformity during childhood.

Clinical Findings

On examination, the right big toe showed marked medial deviation (Figure 2 A), supination, and plantar flexion (clawing) deformity. It also had a medial hypertrophic scar (Figure 2 B) from a previous surgery. The first metatarsophalangeal joint range of motion was 20° dorsiflexion and 20° plantar flexion without pain when moving or walking.

Figure 2
Images showing the (A) clinical frontal view and (B) clinical side view of preoperative deformity.

Diagnostic Assessment

Standing foot plain radiographs (Figure 3, A and B) showed maintained joint space, no osteophytes with medial subluxation, and the first metatarsal was short with a reduced head size and reduced articular surface size. The patient was interested in a salvage solution rather than joint fusion, given the contracted medial scar, his tendency for scar contracture, short metatarsal, and magnitude of the deformity. After counseling, the patient agreed to use a hexapod circular external fixator to correct the deformity.

Posterior talofibular ligament — the posterior talofibular ligament runs from the posteromedial portion of the fibula to the lateral tubercle on the posterior aspect of the talus; it is intracapsular but extrasynovial; it is the strongest of the lateral ligaments and primarily functions to provide transverse plane rotatory stability; although rarely involved in a typical lateral ankle sprain, movements that involve ankle dorsiflexion, foot external rotation and pronation, along with limb internal rotation may cause injury to the posterior talofibular ligament.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^114WxbQx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Range of motion

Active movements. Hip flexion (most children can bring their knee to touch their chest; 120–135°), hip extension (30°), abduction (45–50°), adduction (20–30°).

Passive movements. Rotation measured with hip and knee flexed to 90°. Total internal and external rotation should equal 90°, internal rotation is greater with femoral anteversion and external rotation is greater with femoral retroversion. Femoral anteversion decreases with age (30° to 15°). If hip range of motion is normal in single planes, combined movement in the hip quadrant position (flexion, adduction, internal rotation) may reproduce pain, especially if there is intra-articular pathology as these movements decrease intracapsular volume.

Special tests

Thomas test for flexion contracture. Patient supine with level pelvis – place your hand under the patient's lumbar spine and flex one hip as far as possible. The patient's back should flatten and the extended leg should remain straight. A hip flexion contracture is present if the patient is unable to extend the leg straight without arching the spine. The degree of contracture is measured as the angle between the table and the leg at the point of greatest extension.

Trendelenburg Test. Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness.

Ober test for contraction of iliotibial band. Patient lying on their side with their affected leg uppermost. Abduct the leg and flex the knee to 90° while keeping the hip joint in neutral position and then bring the leg into slight hip extension and external rotation. On release of the leg the thigh should drop into an adducted position. The thigh will remain abducted in a positive test.

FABER or Patrick test. Patient lying supine and leg passively brought into Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation with foot resting on opposite knee. Press down gently but firmly on the flexed knee and the opposite anterior superior iliac crest. Pain may be felt in the groin with intraarticular hip pathology or SI joint region with SI pathology.

Flexibility

The hip should be moved thru active range of motion and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (rectus femoris, biceps femoris).

### Clubfoot treatment in 2015: a global perspective [^113V5ba1]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Clubfoot, also known as congenital talipes equinovarus affects around 174 000 children born each year, with 91% born in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) (Global Clubfoot Initiative (GCI), unpublished data, 2017). Clubfoot can, in up to 95% of cases, be treated successfully using a largely non-surgical technique: the Ponseti method of treatment. The Ponseti method is now considered to be the gold standard of treatment in the USA, and its use has spread widely throughout high-income countries (HICs), largely replacing previously used surgical and conservative techniques. It is also more cost-effective, less invasive and has lower risks of complications than surgical treatments. As such, it is an ideal solution for low-resource settings.

Ponseti treatment is made up of two phases:
Corrective phase: correction of deformity by manipulation of the foot and application of plaster casts, changed weekly, followed by a percutaneous Achilles tendon tenotomy in most cases.
Maintenance phase: the feet are held in the corrected position by use of a foot abduction brace (FAB) in order to prevent relapse of deformity. The FAB is worn for 23/24 hours for the first 12 weeks, and then during sleep until 4–5 years old.

Treatment is most effective if initiated early, ideally during infancy, but there are now numerous reports of older children being treated using the Ponseti technique.

Without treatment, clubfoot is a severely disabling condition leading to pain and loss of ability to walk as well as stigma and exclusion from many aspects of daily life such as education and employment.

### Surgical management of persistent intoeing gait due to increased internal tibial torsion in children [^112VGgF9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intoeing gait is frequently seen in developing children, and in most cases it resolves with growth. However, persistent, extreme intoeing gait, due to increased internal tibial torsion, may disrupt gait function. At our institution, children with symptomatic intoeing gait are evaluated per a standardized protocol, which includes quantitative gait analysis. When the primary cause is increased internal tibial torsion, surgical correction by supramalleolar tibial rotational osteotomy is recommended.

Methods

The study design was a retrospective case series, with normative controls (31 children), of typically developing children with symptomatic intoeing gait who were treated by isolated supramalleolar tibial rotation osteotomy (28 children, with 45 treated extremities). Preoperative and 1-year postoperative physical examination, kinematic, kinetic, and pedobarographic data were compared. Patient-reported and parent-reported outcomes in functional and satisfaction domains were assessed by items on a 7-point questionnaire.

Results

Internal tibial torsion, foot progression angle, and knee rotation were normalized following tibial rotation osteotomy. Compensatory external hip rotation and external knee progression angle were significantly improved but not normalized following tibial rotation osteotomy. An increased coronal plane knee varus moment was significantly decreased following surgery. Increased sagittal and transverse plane knee moments were significantly decreased but not normalized following surgery. Significant improvements were observed with respect to tripping, falling, foot/ankle pain, and knee pain following surgery.

Conclusions

Children with symptomatic intoeing gait because of increased internal tibial torsion have characteristic primary and compensatory kinematic gait deviations that result in increased loading about the knee during the stance phase of gait. Correction of the internal tibial torsion by rotation osteotomy improves, but does not normalize, all the kinematic and kinetic gait deviations associated with intoeing gait. The association between increased internal tibial torsion and degenerative arthritis of the knee in adults may be a consequence of longstanding increased loading of the knee joint due to the kinematic gait deviations seen with intoeing gait.

### Is it possible to treat recurrent clubfoot with the ponseti technique after posteromedial release? a preliminary study [^1129wejE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The Ponseti technique for treating clubfoot has been popularized for idiopathic clubfoot and more recently several syndromic causes of clubfoot. We asked whether it could be used to treat recurrent clubfoot following failed posteromedial release. We retrospectively reviewed 58 children (83 clubfeet) treated by the Ponseti technique for recurrent deformity after posteromedial release in three centers. The minimum followup was 24 months (average, 45 months; range, 24–80 months). We determined initial and final Pirani scores and range of motion of the ankle and subtalar joint. Plantigrade and fully corrected feet were obtained in 71 feet (86%); 11 feet obtained partial correction; one patient failed treatment and underwent another posteromedial release. Recurrences occurred in nine patients (12 feet or 14%). Initial Pirani scores improved in all but one patient; severity of deformity was also inferred by number of casts used for treatment. The age at treatment and numbers of casts did not influence the scores of Pirani et al. The scores were similar among the three orthopaedic surgeons.

### Late effects of clubfoot deformity in adolescent and young adult patients whose initial treatment was an extensive soft-tissue release: topic review and clinical case series [^114sLeFA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Identifying patterns of pathology present in adolescent and young adult patients can aid in the evaluation and treatment of complex residual clubfoot deformities. This case series and literature review may help develop a more standardized approach to the treatment of these difficult problems with the goal of maintaining motion, improving function, and decreasing pain. Separation of patients into diagnostic categories with a listing of the surgical procedures needed to correct these deformities may help surgeons plan these complex procedures and guide future research focused on this group of patients. The Ponseti Method has proven long-term results into adulthood and it is hoped that because this method is adopted in more parts of the world, there will be fewer long-term sequelae requiring surgical treatment.

Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Literature Review

We limited our literature review to the management of recurrent and residual clubfoot deformity in adolescent patients treated with previous surgery. The references in the literature concerning this patient population are few, and most articles focus on a single type of deformity seen in residual clubfoot or discuss 1 particular treatment method. Existing articles include relatively small sample sizes, and many rely on subjective and nonvalidated outcome measures. Meaningful data that can lead to conclusions on clinical outcomes are difficult to obtain because of the wide variability in the types and severity of deformities and treatments used.

The late effects of clubfoot deformity in adolescents and young adulthood present a multitude of management challenges, as described in this report and others. Residual problems related to a previous clubfoot deformity may take many forms. The treatments of infants and young children with congenital clubfoot continue to be refined and have evolved over time. Current articles, within the past decade, suggest that for initial treatment of a clubfoot deformity, appropriate casting and/or stretching techniques combined with limited surgical soft-tissue releases may lead to better results than casting combined with extensive soft-tissue releases. Even the latest techniques can still result in long-term sequelae of the deformity in some patients. In the older patient with a recurrent or persistent deformity, the foot and ankle is often characterized by joint stiffness, nonpassively correctable deformity, developmental periarticular angular deformities, and bony impingements. Therefore, treatments in these older patients rely less on serial casting techniques and more on surgical correction of these late effects.

### Arthrogryposis in infancy, multidisciplinary approach: case report [^113ycbRm]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic procedures

Orthopaedic treatment was initiated at the age of 3 months. It started with a series of manipulative plasters using a modified Ponseti's protocol (treatment of clubfeet) (changed once a week, during the treatment intermissions the boy was taken for the rehabilitation at the ward). The condition before the plaster manipulation is presented at the Figure 4.

Figure 4
Lower limbs at the age of 14 weeks. Panel A: Front view. Panel B: Right side view.

Through the use of plaster casts a correction of knee joint flexion to 45° was achieved, then plasters on the lower limbs were combined with an aluminium crossbar, in order to achieve a correction of the rotation in the hip joints (Figures 5 and 6).

Thanks to the integrated rehabilitation approach and orthopaedic treatment a visible improvement in the range of motion, as well as in the functionality of the child, was achieved. The child continues orthopaedic treatment and rehabilitation. Functional assessment and joint deformation assessment had been performed four times since the child's birth (Table 1).

### Effectiveness of a digital-based gradual exercise training program for preventing relapse in congenital clubfoot: a protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113hf3wF]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The severity of the initial deformity, as assessed by Pirani scoring, along with inadequate activation of the ankle evertor muscles, restricted range of ankle motion, and non-compliance with bracing, have been identified as primary risk factors for recurrence. The Dimeglio scoring provides an objective way to assess the severity of CCF. It is correlated with the number of casts required for correction in the Ponseti method, and can predict treatment difficulty as well as relapse rate. Besides, after the initial correction, ongoing or recurring fibrotic retraction in the tarsal ligaments and surrounding tissues exerts a pulling force on the medial ankle and foot joints. Evidence suggests that a congenital neuromuscular imbalance constitutes the deforming forces present in clubfoot. Equinus deformity is reported as the most common deformity at relapse, primarily characterized by limited dorsiflexion of the foot, and over 26% of patients did not maintain this range of motion. Therefore, it is challenging to maintain long-term correction and manage the risk factors for relapse in children with CCF.

### Tibialis spastic varus foot caused by osteoid osteoma of the calcaneus [^116qqPei]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Tibialis spastic varus foot is an extremely rare condition. A 30-year-old man had tibialis spastic varus foot caused by juxtaarticular osteoid osteoma of the calcaneus. The correct diagnosis was delayed because the symptoms were similar to arthritis and the nidus was difficult to detect on plain radiographs. Curettage of the tumor was done, and the osseous defect was filled with interporous hydroxyapatite. The pain was relieved immediately after surgery. The varus deformity of the foot and spasm of the tibialis anterior muscle gradually improved. Three years 10 months after surgery, the patient was pain-free and the spasm of the tibialis anterior muscle had disappeared. The varus deformity and motion of the foot improved, but a restricted range of motion remained. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no published descriptions of tibialis spastic varus foot caused by juxtaarticular osteoid osteoma of the calcaneus.

### Correction of ankle malalignment in severe fibular hemimelia [^115nDemX]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

On clinical examination at the final follow-up 3 patients presented normal ankle joint and heel position however, the radiologic calcaneus valgus (CTA 20 to 25 degrees) was present. Similarly, in the sagittal plane, the calcaneus was observed to be more horizontal than in healthy patients (0 degrees inclination or lower); nevertheless, a clinically plantigrade foot was observed.

While the surgical procedure has been described previously, a few points of the technique are worth noting. The total anlage excision has been described as crucial technical point, and this was confirmed by Popkov et al. We agree with such approach, even if it was fused to the talocalcaneus complex and partial joint opening was needed. The procedure was primarily extra-articular, and we aimed to avoid interference with the ankle joint capsule. In cases of arthrotomy, the capsule was sutured or reconstructed with local soft tissues. The results of our tibial shaft axis and distal tibial configuration both postoperatively and at follow-up (aLDTA 88.9 and 88.3 degrees) were similar to those described by Popkov et al(88.5 and 87.1 degrees, respectively) in the group with anlage excision. Even after extensive anlage excision, we observed a trend toward progressive valgus knee deformity which is in line with data reported by Radler et al. Knee valgus was successfully managed by temporary hemiepiphysiodesis using an 8-plate. One of the clinical issues in FH is that the growth potential of the growth plates in the affected limbs is not only limited but also reveals asymmetry, resulting in a tendency for valgus deformity recurrence. Therefore, even after surgical treatment, there is a tendency for a rebound phenomenon throughout the growth period. This issue should be addressed as it appears during growth.

### Gait analysis of children treated for clubfoot with physical therapy or the ponseti cast technique [^1141St3v]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, clubfoot is initially treated with nonoperative methods including the Ponseti cast technique and the French functional physical therapy program. Our goal was to evaluate the function of children treated with these techniques.

Methods

We reviewed the cases of 182 patients with idiopathic clubfoot (273 feet) who were initially treated nonoperatively. Seventy-seven patients (119 feet) were excluded because they had either received a combination of nonoperative treatments or had undergone surgery prior to testing. Gait analysis was performed when the children were approximately two years of age. Temporal and kinematic data were classified as abnormal if they were more than one standard deviation from normal.

Results

Gait analysis was performed on 105 patients (fifty-six treated with casts and forty-nine treated with physical therapy) with 154 involved feet (seventy-nine treated with casts and seventy-five treated with physical therapy). These patients were an average of two years and three months of age, and their initial Diméglio scores ranged between 10 and 17. No significant differences in cadence parameters were found between the two groups. The rate of normal kinematic ankle motion in the sagittal plane was higher in the group treated with physical therapy (65% of the feet) than it was in the group treated with the Ponseti cast technique (47%) (p = 0.0317). More children treated with physical therapy walked with knee hyperextension (37% of the feet) (p < 0.0001), an equinus gait (15%) (p = 0.0051), and footdrop (19%) (p = 0.0072); only one patient treated with casts walked with an equinus gait, and only three demonstrated footdrop. In contrast, more of the patients in the cast-treatment group demonstrated excessive stance-phase dorsiflexion (48% of the feet) (p < 0.0001) and a calcaneus gait (10%). More feet in the physical therapy group had an increased internal foot progression angle (44% compared with 24% in the cast-treatment group; p = 0.0144) and increased shank-based foot rotation (73% compared with 57% in the cast-treatment group; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

While the rate of normal kinematic ankle motion in the sagittal plane was 65% in the group treated with physical therapy, the gait abnormalities that were seen in that group were characterized by mild equinus and/or footdrop. The rate of normal kinematic ankle motion in the sagittal plane was 47% in the cast-treatment group, but the most common gait abnormality in this group was mildly increased dorsiflexion in the stance phase. The rates of calcaneus gait and equinus gait were ≤ 15% in each nonoperative group. The differences between the physical therapy and cast-treatment groups may, in part, be the result of the percutaneous Achilles tendon lengthening that is performed as part of the Ponseti cast technique but not as part of the physical therapy program.

### A comparison between laterally wedged insoles and ankle-foot orthoses for the treatment of medial osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized cross-over trial [^1164wf4L]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

At the biomechanical level, the external knee adduction moment, which correlates with the severity of the varus deformity, represents a dynamic parameter for the load distribution of the knee joint in the frontal plane and is used as a surrogate parameter for the disease progression. Especially in the early stance phase, there is a close correlation between external knee adduction moment and the contact forces in the medial compartment of the knee. The reduction of external moments in the frontal plane is therefore the most important target in the treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis.

Our results show a reduction of the first maximum of the external knee adduction moment by 18% with the ankle-foot orthosis and smaller effects on both maxima with the lateral wedge insole. The reduction of the first peak of the external knee adduction moment with the ankle-foot orthosis was significantly greater. Comparable results have already been shown by Schmalz et al.and Fantini Pagani et al.on healthy study groups. These effects were also confirmed in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Miyazaki described a 6.46 times higher risk of osteoarthritis progression with each 20% increase of overall peak external knee adduction moment. For this reason, the authors concluded that the 5%–10% reduction typically achieved with lateral wedge insoles may already be clinically meaningful. In this context, our results confirm previously known biomechanical ankle-foot orthosis effects, but with a lower effect size. The effect on the external knee adduction moment may have been reduced in our setting by individually adjusting the ankle-foot orthosis setting for the participants; in the aforementioned studies, measurements were taken in a maximum valgizing setting.

### Results of gait analysis including the oxford foot model in children with clubfoot treated with the ponseti method [^113GTFsQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to evaluate how clubfeet treated with the Ponseti method compare with control feet in gait analysis and whether additional information can be provided by the Oxford foot model.

Methods

All patients with a minimum age of three years in our prospective database of clubfeet treated with the Ponseti method were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were an associated syndrome or neurological disease, positional (slight) clubfoot, and presentation at an age of more than three months. Of the 125 patients with 199 clubfeet who satisfied the criteria, thirty-six (29%) agreed to participate in the study. Four of these were excluded because of insufficient gait analysis data, leaving thirty-two patients with fifty clubfeet for evaluation. Clinical examination and three-dimensional gait analysis including the Oxford foot model were performed, and a disease-specific questionnaire was administered. Kinetic and kinematic results were compared with those of an age-matched control group (n = 15).

Results

The mean score on the disease-specific questionnaire was 83.5. Gait analysis showed significantly decreased range of motion, plantar flexion, and power of the ankle compared with controls. The mean external foot progression angle of 5.7° in the Ponseti group was slightly less than that in the controls. Slight intoeing occurred in 24%, and 12% did not achieve a neutral position during swing phase. Slight compensation was observed, including external rotation of the hip in 28%. The Oxford foot model revealed differences in foot motion between the groups.

Conclusions

Clubfoot treatment with the Ponseti method yielded good clinical results with high functional scores. Three-dimensional gait analysis demonstrated distinctive but slight deviations. Intoeing was less frequent and less severe compared with groups in the literature. We recommend the use of three-dimensional gait analysis, including a foot model, as an objective tool for evaluation of the results of clubfoot treatment.

### Interventions for congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) [^111MLJG3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), which is also known as clubfoot, is a common congenital orthopaedic condition characterised by an excessively turned in foot (equinovarus) and high medial longitudinal arch (cavus). If left untreated it can result in long-term disability, deformity and pain. Interventions can be conservative (such as splinting or stretching) or surgical. The review was first published in 2012 and we reviewed new searches in 2013 (update published 2014).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for CTEV.

Search Methods

On 29 April 2013, we searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to April 2013), AMED (1985 to April 2013), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro to April 2013). We also searched for ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2006 to July 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov (to November 2013). We checked the references of included studies. We searched NHSEED, DARE and HTA for information for inclusion in the Discussion.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating interventions for CTEV. Participants were people of all ages with CTEV of either one or both feet.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias in included trials and extracted the data. We contacted authors of included trials for missing information. We collected adverse event information from trials when it was available.

Main Results

We identified 14 trials in which there were 607 participants; one of the trials was newly included at this 2014 update. The use of different outcome measures prevented pooling of data for meta-analysis even when interventions and participants were comparable. All trials displayed bias in four or more areas. One trial reported on the primary outcome of function, though raw data were not available to be analysed. We were able to analyse data on foot alignment (Pirani score), a secondary outcome, from three trials. Two of the trials involved participants at initial presentation. One reported that the Ponseti technique significantly improved foot alignment compared to the Kite technique. After 10 weeks of serial casting, the average total Pirani score of the Ponseti group was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.32) lower than that of the Kite group. The second trial found the Ponseti technique to be superior to a traditional technique, with average total Pirani scores of the Ponseti participants 1.50 lower (95% CI 0.72 to 2.28) after serial casting and Achilles tenotomy. A trial in which the type of presentation was not reported found no difference between an accelerated Ponseti or standard Ponseti treatment. At the end of serial casting, the average total Pirani scores in the standard group were 0.31 lower (95% CI -0.40 to 1.02) than the accelerated group. Two trials in initial cases found relapse following Ponseti treatment was more likely to be corrected with further serial casting compared to the Kite groups which more often required major surgery (risk difference 25% and 50%). There is a lack of evidence for different plaster casting products, the addition of botulinum toxin A during the Ponseti technique, different types of major foot surgery, continuous passive motion treatment following major foot surgery, or treatment of relapsed or neglected cases of CTEV. Most trials did not report on adverse events. In trials evaluating serial casting techniques, adverse events included cast slippage (needing replacement), plaster sores (pressure areas) and skin irritation. Adverse events following surgical procedures included infection and the need for skin grafting.

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited evidence available, the Ponseti technique produced significantly better short-term foot alignment compared to the Kite technique and compared to a traditional technique. The quality of this evidence was low to very low. An accelerated Ponseti technique may be as effective as a standard technique, according to moderate quality evidence. Relapse following the Kite technique more often led to major surgery compared to relapse following the Ponseti technique. We could draw no conclusions from other included trials because of the limited use of validated outcome measures and lack of available raw data. Future randomised controlled trials should address these issues.

### Single-bundle ACL reconstruction with and without extra-articular reconstruction: evaluation with robotic lower leg rotation testing and patient satisfaction scores [^117K4J4P]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Robotic testing

The robotic knee testing system consisted of two servomotors designed to apply up to 5.65 Nm of torque about the centre of rotation of the tibia. Patients were positioned supine in the device, with both knees flexed to 30° and the second toe perpendicular to the floor (Fig. 2). The position of the toe was verified using a digital goniometer referencing the earth. The distal femur was positioned on a pad 0.1 m proximal to the joint line. One medial and one lateral post were used to rotationally position the distal femur, such that the patella rested comfortably under a patella clamp. The two posts were then brought together to clamp the distal femur, thus limiting perturbation of the femur during internal and external rotation. The patella clamp was engaged with 178 N of force to effectively anchor the patella in the trochlea of the femur and the distal femur to the posterior pad. The tibia was abducted or adducted with respect to the femur to ensure the knee rested in a neutral varus/valgus position. The patient's feet were attached to footplates that were mounted to the servomotor system. The heel rested in a padded V to anchor and centre the heel. The centre of rotation of the lower leg was then taken to be 2.5 cm anterior to the heel at the plantar surface of the foot. The forefoot was strapped to an L plate that extended superiorly on the medial aspect of the foot. The foot was then maximally dorsiflexed by inflating a small inflatable air bladder between the sole and the plate to 60 mm Hg to limit foot and ankle motion during rotational testing.

### Interventions for congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) [^1112BGG2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), also known as clubfoot, is a common congenital orthopaedic condition characterised by an excessively turned-in foot (equinovarus) and high medial longitudinal arch (cavus). If left untreated it can result in long-term disability, deformity and pain. Interventions can be conservative (such as splinting or stretching) or surgical. Different treatments might be effective at different stages: at birth (initial presentation); when initial treatment does not work (resistant presentation); when the initial treatment works but the clubfoot returns (relapse/recurrent presentation); and when there has been no early treatment (neglected presentation). This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and last updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any intervention for any type of CTEV in people of any age.

Search Methods

On 28 May 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. We also searched for ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (to May 2019). We checked the references of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating interventions for CTEV, including interventions compared to other interventions, sham intervention or no intervention. Participants were people of all ages with CTEV of either one or both feet.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risks of bias in included trials and extracted the data. We contacted authors of included trials for missing information. We collected adverse event information from trials when it was available. When required we attempted to obtain individual patient data (IPD) from trial authors for re-analysis. If unit-of-analysis issues were present and IPD unavailable we did not report summary data, MAIN RESULTS: We identified 21 trials with 905 participants; seven trials were newly included for this update. Fourteen trials assessed initial cases of CTEV (560 participants), four trials assessed resistant cases (181 participants) and three trials assessed cases of unknown timing (153 participants). The use of different outcome measures prevented pooling of data for meta-analysis, even when interventions and participants were comparable. All trials displayed high or unclear risks of bias in three or more domains. Twenty trials provided data. Two trials reported on the primary outcome of function using a validated scale, but the data were not suitable for inclusion because of unit-of-analysis issues, as raw data were not available for re-analysis. We were able to analyse data on foot alignment (Pirani score), a secondary outcome, from three trials in participants at initial presentation. The Pirani score is a scale ranging from zero to six, where a higher score indicates a more severe foot. At initial presentation, one trial reported that the Ponseti technique significantly improved foot alignment compared to the Kite technique. After 10 weeks of serial casting, the average total Pirani score of the Ponseti group was 1.15 points lower than that of the Kite group (mean difference (MD) -1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.32 to -0.98; 60 feet; low-certainty evidence). A second trial found the Ponseti technique to be superior to a traditional technique, with mean total Pirani scores of the Ponseti participants 1.50 points lower than after serial casting and Achilles tenotomy (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.72; 28 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One trial found evidence that there may be no difference between casting materials in the Ponseti technique, with semi-rigid fibreglass producing average total Pirani scores 0.46 points higher than plaster of Paris at the end of serial casting (95% CI -0.07 to 0.99; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no trials in relapsed or neglected cases of CTEV. A trial in which the type of presentation was not reported showed no evidence of a difference between an accelerated Ponseti and a standard Ponseti treatment in foot alignment. At the end of serial casting, the average total Pirani score in the accelerated group was 0.31 points higher than the standard group (95% CI -0.40 to 1.02; 40 participants; low-certainty evidence). No trial assessed gait using a validated assessment. Health-related quality of life was reported in some trials but data were not available for re-analysis. There is a lack of evidence for the addition of botulinum toxin A during the Ponseti technique, different types of major foot surgery or continuous passive motion treatment following major foot surgery. Most trials did not report on adverse events. Two trials found that further serial casting was more likely to correct relapse after Ponseti treatment than after the Kite technique, which more often required major surgery (risk differences 25% and 50%). In trials evaluating serial casting techniques, adverse events included cast slippage (needing replacement), plaster sores (pressure areas), and skin irritation. Adverse events following surgical procedures included infection and the need for skin grafting.

Authors' Conclusions

From the evidence available, the Ponseti technique may produce significantly better short-term foot alignment compared to the Kite technique. The certainty of evidence is too low for us to draw conclusions about the Ponseti technique compared to a traditional technique. An accelerated Ponseti technique may be as effective as a standard technique, but results are based on a single small comparative trial. When using the Ponseti technique semi-rigid fibreglass casting may be as effective as plaster of Paris. Relapse following the Kite technique more often led to major surgery compared to relapse following the Ponseti technique. We could draw no conclusions from other included trials because of the limited use of validated outcome measures and the unavailability of raw data. Future RCTs should address these issues.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^114DUXSq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain — Bursitis/Haglund's pathway outlines a parallel evaluation and stepwise care: Significant history includes acute or chronic posterior heel pain, pain aggravated by shoe pressure, morning pain, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness lateral to Achilles, posterior lateral subcutaneous bony prominence, and ± local inflammation/bursitis. Radiographs demonstrate posterior superior prominence to calcaneus — Haglund's deformity and soft tissue swelling — bursitis. Initial treatment options include patient-directed treatment options (open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics) plus orthoses, accommodative padding, oral antiinflammatories, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker, continuation of initial treatment options, and consideration of injection of bursa are directed; continued lack of improvement leads to surgery with resection Haglund's/bursa or calcaneal osteotomy. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, with a reminder to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### The importance of having a single, dedicated medical team to treat congenital talipes equinovarus using the ponseti method: a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes after 3 years of follow-up [^115FHyK1]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), also known as clubfoot, is a 3-dimensional deformity of the foot characterized by equines, hindfoot varus, forefoot adductus, and forefoot cavus. It is a relatively common pediatric orthopaedic disorder affecting between 0.56 and 4 children per 1000 live births, – and, in the long term, it is a frequent cause of disability in adult populations. Clubfoot causes the patient to walk on the lateral border of the foot and, in severe cases, with the dorsum of the foot. If untreated, this deformity can result in severe disability with severe sequelae.

One of the most popular treatment options is the Ponseti method, which uses clubfoot manipulation and serial casting. The Ponseti method has been reported to have good outcomes in 95% of cases. It is easy to learn, cost-effective, and can achieve significantly better long-term functional outcomes than surgical interventions. This technique is associated with fewer surgical revisions, lower costs, and better long-term functional outcomes than primary soft-tissue release.

A systematic review of the literature reported that cases of relapse ranged from 2% to 40%, with lower rates in studies with follow-up durations of less than 4 years (17%) than in longer studies (32%). A systematic review reported that relapsed cases were associated with poor brace tolerance and parents with low levels of education or low incomes. Indeed, the level of education seems to be a pertinent factor. If parents understand the treatment, the adherence is improved. The economic context may come second, especially in countries like Switzerland, with social aids.

In contrast, strict adherence to the Ponseti method's basic principles is essential to achieving favorable outcomes. It seems that dedicated coordination of care in a clubfoot treatment program results in fewer major surgical events when continuity of care is ensured.– In 2016, a multicentre study also reported on the importance of having only 1 provider centralizing CTEV treatment and the delivery of care. However, the multicentric design did not exclude the influence of the center. More recently, Carry et alreported that the implementation of a quality improvement program (including a dedicated team) was associated with a decrease in major surgery and improved adherence to established guidelines for CTEV management.

### Clubfoot: congenital talipes equinovarus [^115SXAZt]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), also known as clubfoot, is a common musculoskeletal entity that affects one to two per 1000 live births worldwide. Imaging modalities including radiography, US, and MRI have emerged as valuable tools for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of CTEV. The deformity is characterized by midfoot cavus, forefoot adductus, and hindfoot varus and equinus. The Ponseti method of manipulation and serial casting is the standard treatment of CTEV. Radiography shows the anatomy, position, and relationships of the different bones of the foot. US allows accurate assessment of cartilaginous and bony structures, in addition to its inherent advantages such as absence of ionizing radiation exposure. One of the indications for US is to monitor the response to Ponseti method treatment. MRI enables visualization of bones, cartilage, and soft tissues and allows multiplanar evaluation of deformities, providing a comprehensive imaging analysis of CTEV. An integrated approach that combines clinical examination and imaging findings is essential for effective management of CTEV. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of CTEV with a review of imaging modalities to help evaluate CTEV, focusing on radiography, US, and MRI. Using this article as a guide, radiologists involved in the assessment and treatment of CTEV can contribute to the management of the condition. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.
