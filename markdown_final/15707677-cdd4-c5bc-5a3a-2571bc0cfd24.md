## Question

Finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, including efficacy, safety, subgroup effects, dosing, and how to integrate it into practice alongside SGLT2 inhibitors and other therapies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease burden and unmet need in HFmrEF/HFpEF. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial design and primary outcomes. Next, I will examine efficacy, including composite and component endpoints and subgroup analyses. After that, I need to check safety, especially hyperkalemia and kidney effects. Then, I should review dosing and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate this into current guideline context and provide a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and unmet need. HFmrEF/HFpEF accounts for roughly half of heart failure cases and carries substantial morbidity and mortality, with limited disease-modifying options historically, so any therapy that reduces worsening HF events is clinically meaningful in this space [^114KdHJM] [^112R6SgF].

> I will now examine the pivotal evidence base. The FINEARTS-HF randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 6,001 patients aged 40 years and older with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≥ 40%, elevated natriuretic peptides, structural heart disease, and recent diuretic use, and followed them for a median of 32 months, which establishes the highest-quality evidence for finerenone in this phenotype [^115gTWcM] [^111iLY8Z].

> Next, I should review the primary outcome and its components. Finerenone reduced the composite of total worsening HF events or cardiovascular death by 16% versus placebo, with a rate ratio of 0.84 and 95% CI 0.74–0.95, driven primarily by fewer HF events; cardiovascular death was numerically lower but not statistically significant, which aligns with the broader HFpEF literature where mortality signals are harder to move [^115gTWcM] [^115FsoDr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. I need to check subgroup effects. The benefit was consistent across LVEF strata, including LVEF < 50%, 50– < 60%, and ≥ 60%, with no significant interaction, supporting use across the HFmrEF/HFpEF spectrum; similarly, benefits were consistent by age, sex, diabetes status, frailty, and kidney risk, which strengthens external validity and practical applicability [^115Pf6H2] [^113F1MY9] [^1156HN2F] [^116ug9u6] [^111Tt4Ya] [^112CQGZH].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical relevance of outpatient worsening events. A prespecified secondary analysis showed finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensifications by 11% and reduced an extended composite including CV death, HF hospitalization, urgent visits, and oral diuretic intensification by 15%; importantly, oral diuretic intensification carried a markedly higher subsequent death risk than stable patients, underscoring that this is a clinically meaningful early marker of decompensation [^1174XfVa] [^113PXLMx] [^112G3S2z].

> I should confirm safety next. Hyperkalemia occurred more frequently with finerenone, but serious hyperkalemia > 6.0 mmol/L was uncommon and manageable with protocolized monitoring; importantly, finerenone reduced hypokalemia, and the overall rate of serious adverse events was similar to placebo, supporting a favorable benefit–risk balance with appropriate surveillance [^115gTWcM] [^111HzpR8].

> Let me think about kidney outcomes and dosing. Finerenone produced a small, early eGFR dip without a long-term slope difference and reduced albuminuria by about 30%, consistent with its cardiorenal profile; dosing is eGFR-based, starting at 10 mg daily if eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 20 mg daily if eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with a maximum of 20 mg daily in CKD and 40 mg daily in HF, and potassium should be checked at 1 week, 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter, with closer monitoring in CKD or when interacting drugs are used [^114nWc6W] [^111nxoLA].

> I should double-check how this fits with current guidance. SGLT2 inhibitors remain foundational in HFmrEF/HFpEF based on EMPEROR-Preserved and DELIVER, and finerenone now joins as an additional evidence-based option; an individual patient meta-analysis across MRA trials shows a smaller but significant benefit in HFmrEF/HFpEF versus HFrEF, reinforcing finerenone's role as a nonsteroidal MRA in this phenotype [^112R6SgF] [^11591dF5].

> But wait, what if a patient is already on an SGLT2 inhibitor; does finerenone still help. Prespecified analyses suggest finerenone's benefit is independent of baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use, and time-updated analyses do not materially alter the treatment effect, supporting additive benefit when combined, though clinicians should still monitor potassium and kidney function when layering therapies [^114jgYw8] [^112QcAQB].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For patients with symptomatic HFmrEF/HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 40%, and elevated natriuretic peptides, finerenone 10–20 mg daily based on eGFR is reasonable on top of guideline-directed therapy, with explicit potassium and renal monitoring; prioritize those with recent worsening HF, higher natriuretic peptide levels, or CKD, where absolute risk and potential absolute benefit are greater, and coordinate with nephrology when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium is borderline [^115gTWcM] [^115r2dVh].

> I should confirm limitations and uncertainties. The trial did not show a significant reduction in cardiovascular death, and the absolute risk reduction is modest, so shared decision-making is essential; additionally, real-world implementation will need to address monitoring logistics and hyperkalemia mitigation, but the consistency of benefit across diverse subgroups and the favorable safety profile support adoption in appropriate patients [^115gTWcM] [^11591dF5].

Finerenone is the first nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to show **significant benefit in HFmrEF/HFpEF** [^115gTWcM], reducing the composite of cardiovascular death and total heart failure events by 16% versus placebo in FINEARTS-HF (rate ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95) [^115gTWcM]. The benefit was **consistent across LVEF strata** [^115Pf6H2], including patients with LVEF ≥ 60%, and was observed irrespective of diabetes, age, sex, or kidney function [^116ug9u6] [^113F1MY9] [^1156HN2F] [^112CQGZH]. Finerenone also reduced outpatient worsening heart failure events requiring diuretic intensification [^1174XfVa] and improved health status, with a modest improvement in KCCQ-TSS at 12 months [^112quUfx]. Hyperkalemia occurred more often with finerenone but was generally manageable with monitoring; serious hyperkalemia (> 6.0 mmol/L) occurred in 2.9% versus 1.4% with placebo, and finerenone reduced hypokalemia [^11591dF5]. Based on these data, finerenone is now **FDA-approved for HF with LVEF ≥ 40%** [^112MbU6d] and is a recommended option in recent expert consensus for HFmrEF/HFpEF, particularly alongside SGLT2 inhibitors [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile

Finerenone is a **nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** [^116TctRx] that blocks aldosterone signaling, reducing inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy in the heart and vasculature [^116TctRx]. Compared with steroidal MRAs, finerenone has higher MR selectivity and a shorter half-life, which may reduce off-target hormonal effects and improve tolerability [^116TctRx].

---

## Clinical evidence: FINEARTS-HF trial

The FINEARTS-HF trial was a **global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study** [^115gTWcM] that enrolled 6,001 patients with symptomatic HF and LVEF ≥ 40% [^111iLY8Z]. Participants were randomized to finerenone or placebo on top of standard therapy, with a median follow-up of 32 months [^115gTWcM].

---

### Primary outcome

The primary outcome was a composite of **total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events** (hospitalization or urgent HF visit requiring IV therapy) and cardiovascular death [^115gTWcM]. Finerenone reduced this composite by 16% versus placebo (rate ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P = 0.007) [^115gTWcM], driven mainly by fewer HF events (rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.71–0.94) [^115gTWcM], while cardiovascular death was numerically lower but not statistically significant (8.1% vs 8.7%; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78–1.11) [^115gTWcM].

---

### Subgroup analyses

Benefits were **consistent across prespecified subgroups**, including:

- **LVEF categories**: < 50%, 50– < 60%, and ≥ 60% (P interaction = 0.70) [^115Pf6H2].
- **Diabetes status**: consistent in patients with and without diabetes (P interaction = 0.93) [^116ug9u6].
- **Age**: consistent across age groups, including patients ≥ 80 years [^113F1MY9].
- **Sex**: similar benefit in women and men [^1156HN2F].
- **Kidney function**: consistent across eGFR strata, including eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112CQGZH].

---

### Secondary outcomes

- **Outpatient worsening HF**: finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensifications by 11% (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80–0.98) [^1174XfVa], indicating fewer early decompensation events managed outside the hospital [^1174XfVa].
- **Health status**: finerenone improved KCCQ-TSS by a mean 1.62 points at 12 months versus placebo (95% CI 0.69–2.56; P < 0.001) [^112quUfx], indicating better symptom burden and quality of life [^notfound].
- **Renal outcomes**: finerenone reduced albuminuria by 30% and slowed chronic eGFR decline, though a composite kidney endpoint was not significantly reduced in this low-risk population [^114nWc6W].

---

## Safety profile

Finerenone was **generally well tolerated** [^115gTWcM]. Hyperkalemia occurred more often than with placebo (9.7% vs 4.2%) [^115gTWcM], but serious hyperkalemia (> 6.0 mmol/L) was infrequent (2.9% vs 1.4%) and rarely led to discontinuation [^11591dF5]. Hypokalemia was less common with finerenone (4.4% vs 9.7%) [^115gTWcM]. Renal adverse events were comparable to placebo, with a small, reversible eGFR dip early that did not translate into excess kidney failure events [^114nWc6W].

---

## Comparison with steroidal MRAs

Steroidal MRAs (spironolactone, eplerenone) are effective in HFrEF [^11591dF5] but have **uncertain benefit in HFpEF** [^115Y3qHa]; TOPCAT showed regional heterogeneity and no overall benefit, though a signal was seen in the Americas cohort [^114RV1kG]. Finerenone, with its nonsteroidal structure and greater MR selectivity, achieved consistent benefits across LVEF ≥ 40% in FINEARTS-HF, suggesting a class effect with improved tolerability [^115gTWcM].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Recent expert consensus pathways endorse MRAs for selected patients with HFpEF, particularly to reduce HF hospitalizations, with careful monitoring of potassium and renal function [^115Y3qHa]. Finerenone's approval for HF with LVEF ≥ 40% [^112MbU6d] and its favorable benefit–risk profile support its use as a foundational therapy in HFmrEF/HFpEF, **especially alongside SGLT2 inhibitors** [^notfound].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Patient selection**: symptomatic HF with LVEF ≥ 40%, elevated natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease [^111iLY8Z].
- **Dosing**: start 10 mg daily if eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; 20 mg daily if eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; titrate to 20 mg or 40 mg based on tolerance and potassium [^1156MFEv].
- **Monitoring**: check potassium and renal function at 1 week, 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter; adjust dose if potassium rises > 5.5 mmol/L [^115RZ6Uh].
- **Combination therapy**: finerenone can be combined with SGLT2 inhibitors, with additive benefits and no significant interaction [^114jgYw8].

---

Finerenone is the **first therapy with robust evidence** to reduce HF events in HFmrEF/HFpEF [^115gTWcM], with consistent benefits across diverse subgroups and a manageable safety profile. It is now FDA-approved for HF with LVEF ≥ 40% [^112MbU6d] and should be considered foundational therapy alongside SGLT2 inhibitors in appropriate patients, with routine potassium and renal monitoring [^115RZ6Uh].

### The role of finerenone in heart failure [^114KdHJM]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) represents approximately half of all HF cases, yet therapeutic options are limited. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation by aldosterone has long been recognized as a key driver of vascular inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy, pathophysiological processes integral to the development and progression of HFmrEF/HFpEF. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has been developed with a distinct pharmacological profile: potent and selective MR blockade with a reduced risk of off-target hormone-related side effects. Large, multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trials in chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes patients (FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD) first highlighted finerenone's cardiorenal benefits, including a reduction in death from cardiovascular causes and hospitalization for HF. More recently, the FINEARTS-HF trial extended this evidence to patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF, demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes. Ongoing studies, such as REDEFINE-HF, CONFIRMATION-HF, and FINALITY-HF, will examine the potential role of finerenone in HF across a broad spectrum of ejection fractions and different clinical settings. This review synthesizes the evolving evidence supporting the role of finerenone as a new option in the management of HF.

### Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of age: a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^1146gdjX]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) is increasing, and it is projected that HFmrEF/HFpEF will soon surpass heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction to become the predominant HF phenotype globally. This trend is primarily driven by aging populations worldwide, and in the United States alone, the population aged ≥ 80 years increased from 4.1 million in 1971 to 13.1 million in 2020, with this change expected to continue or accelerate. Consequently, identifying effective treatments for HFmrEF/HFpEF, particularly in the elderly, to reduce worsening HF events and improve health status has emerged as an important contemporary therapeutic challenge.– This challenge is amplified by concerns that older patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF are often frail and have multiple comorbidities leading to polypharmacy. These considerations, coupled with differing pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in older compared with younger people, raise further concerns that treatments may be less well-tolerated in older adults. Therefore, it is crucial to also evaluate the safety of incorporating new medications into the existing therapeutic regimens of these patients. Without an in-depth understanding of the efficacy and tolerability of novel therapies, there is a significant risk of their underuse, as has been repeatedly observed for many valuable treatments in older individuals. –

In the FINEARTS-HF trial (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the effects of the selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone were compared with those of placebo in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF. Among the 6001 participants analyzed, finerenone added to background therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) HF events compared with placebo.FINEARTS-HF enrolled patients with a wide range of ages (40–97 years), and, notably, 64% of trial participants were aged ≥ 70 years and 24% were ≥ 80 years of age. In this prespecified analysis, we examined the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared with placebo, stratified by age.

### Finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^115gTWcM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but their efficacy in those with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction has not been established. Data regarding the efficacy and safety of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction are needed.

Methods

In this international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or greater, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive finerenone (at a maximum dose of 20 mg or 40 mg once daily) or matching placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of total worsening heart failure events (with an event defined as a first or recurrent unplanned hospitalization or urgent visit for heart failure) and death from cardiovascular causes. The components of the primary outcome and safety were also assessed.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 32 months, 1083 primary-outcome events occurred in 624 of 3003 patients in the finerenone group, and 1283 primary-outcome events occurred in 719 of 2998 patients in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74 to 0.95; P = 0.007). The total number of worsening heart failure events was 842 in the finerenone group and 1024 in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.94; P = 0.006). The percentage of patients who died from cardiovascular causes was 8.1% and 8.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11). Finerenone was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia and a reduced risk of hypokalemia.

Conclusions

In patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone resulted in a significantly lower rate of a composite of total worsening heart failure events and death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

### Finerenone in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: rationale and design of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^111iLY8Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), spironolactone and eplerenone, are strongly recommended in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but the balance of efficacy and safety in those with higher LVEF has not been well established. Broad use of steroidal MRAs has further been limited in part due to safety concerns around risks of hyperkalaemia, gynecomastia, and kidney dysfunction. These risks may be mitigated by the unique pharmacological properties of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone. The FINEARTS-HF trial is designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the selective non-steroidal MRA finerenone among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF is a global, multicentre, event-driven randomized trial evaluating oral finerenone versus matching placebo in symptomatic patients with HF with LVEF ≥ 40%. Adults (≥ 40years) with HF with New York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms, LVEF ≥ 40%, evidence of structural heart disease, and diuretic use for at least the previous 30days were eligible. All patients required elevated natriuretic peptide levels: for patients in sinus rhythm, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥ 300pg/ml (or B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] ≥ 100pg/ml) were required, measured within 30days (in those without a recent worsening HF event) or within 90days (in those with a recent worsening HF event). Qualifying levels of NT-proBNP or BNP were tripled if a patient was in atrial fibrillation at screening. Estimated glomerular filtration rate < 25ml/min/1.73m 2 or serum potassium > 5.0mmol/L were key exclusion criteria. Patients were enrolled irrespective of clinical care setting (whether hospitalized, recently hospitalized, or ambulatory). The primary endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) HF events. The trial started on 14 September 2020 and has validly randomized 6001 participants across 37 countries. Approximately 2375 total primary composite events are targeted.

Conclusions

The FINEARTS-HF trial will determine the efficacy and safety of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone in a broad population of hospitalized and ambulatory patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^115Pf6H2]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of treatments for heart failure (HF) may vary among patients according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We examined the effect of finerenone according to LVEF in FINEARTS-HF.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 40%. The treatment effect of finerenone was examined in prespecified analyses according to LVEF categories (< 50%, ≥ 50% to < 60%, and ≥ 60%) and with LVEF as a continuous variable. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death.

Results

Baseline LVEF data were available for 5993 of the 6001 participants in FINEARTS-HF. Mean and median LVEF were 53 ± 8% and 53% (interquartile range, 46%-58%), respectively. LVEF was < 50% in 2172 (36%), between 50% and < 60% in 2674 (45%), and ≥ 60% in 1147 (19%). Patients with higher LVEF were older, were more commonly female, were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, and more frequently had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease compared with those with a lower LVEF. Finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total HF events consistently across LVEF categories (LVEF < 50% rate ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68–1.03]; LVEF ≥ 50% to < 60% rate ratio, 0.80 [0.66–0.97]; and LVEF ≥ 60% rate ratio, 0.94 [0.70–1.25]; P interaction = 0.70). There was no modification of the benefit of finerenone across the range of LVEF when analyzed as a continuous variable (P interaction = 0.28). There was a similar consistent effect of finerenone on reducing the total number of worsening HF events (continuous P interaction = 0.26).

Conclusions

In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events, irrespective of LVEF.

### Finerenone and outpatient worsening heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^1174XfVa]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Worsening heart failure (HF) is commonly managed in the outpatient setting with adjustments in oral diuretic therapy. The effect of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone on outpatient worsening HF events in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of finerenone on outpatient worsening HF events requiring oral diuretic intensification among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a secondary analysis of the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF), a global, multicenter randomized clinical trial. Patients had HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or greater. Data analysis was conducted from September 1 to December 10, 2024.

Intervention

Participants were randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome events (cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and outpatient urgent HF visit requiring intravenous diuretic therapy) were centrally adjudicated. In this prespecified analysis, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were defined as initiations of loop or thiazide diuretic or increases in loop diuretic dosage. The risk of all-cause death following each type of worsening HF event (HF hospitalization, urgent HF visit, or outpatient oral diuretic intensification) and the effect of finerenone on outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone or as part of an extended composite outcome with primary outcome events were evaluated.

Results

A total of 6001 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.0 [9.6] years; 2732 [46%] female) were enrolled. First worsening HF events included 664 HF hospitalizations, 87 urgent HF visits, and 1250 oral diuretic intensifications. Rates of death were higher following worsening HF: 27.7 (95% CI, 24.3–31.5) per 100 patient-years after HF hospitalization, 13.6 (95% CI, 8.8–21.1) per 100 patient-years after urgent HF visit, and 11.6 (95% CI, 10.2–13.1) per 100 patient-years after outpatient oral diuretic intensification compared with 4.5 (95% CI, 4.2–4.9) per 100 patient-years for patients without worsening HF. Adding outpatient oral diuretic intensification to the primary outcome increased the number of patients experiencing events from 1343 to 2238. Finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80–0.98]; P = 0.02) and in an extended composite outcome that further included cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and urgent HF visit (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78–0.92]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Outpatient worsening HF events requiring oral diuretic intensification were common, associated with poor prognosis, and reduced by finerenone in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^111dZqEM]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The clinical characteristics and the risk of outcomes vary substantially among patients with heart failure (HF) according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Furthermore, the efficacy of several treatments for heart failure differs across the range of LVEF. The benefits of some neurohumoral modulating therapies on reducing the risk of death and worsening HF in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction were not replicated in trials of patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). – However, a series of post hoc analyses from randomized, placebo-controlled trials pooling individual patient data from across the entire range of LVEF have shown that the benefits of some neurohumoral modulating treatments may extend to those with a LVEF reduced below the normal range (ie, < 55%–60%), with attenuation or absence of benefit in those with a normal LVEF. – Conversely, the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were consistent across the entire spectrum of LVEF. Therefore, it is important to understand whether the efficacy of new treatments for patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF is modified by LVEF.

In FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events in patients with HF and an LVEF ≥ 40%. – This analysis examined whether the benefits and safety of finerenone differed across the range of LVEF among patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF enrolled in FINEARTS-HF.

FINEARTS-HF Trial Design and Objectives

FINEARTS-HF was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, event-driven trial that examined the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared with placebo in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF. The design, baseline characteristics, and primary results are published. – Key inclusion criteria were age ≥ 40 years, symptomatic HF in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV, treatment with a diuretic for ≥ 30 days before randomization, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40% with evidence of structural heart disease (either left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) measured within 12 months of screening. Patients were also required to have elevated levels of NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) > 300 pg/mL or BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) > 100 pg/mL for those in sinus rhythm, or NT-proBNP > 900 pg/mL or BNP > 300 pg/mL for those in atrial fibrillation. These measurements were to be taken within 90 days for patients with a recent worsening HF event within 90 days before randomization, or within 30 days before randomization for those without a recent worsening HF event. Both ambulatory and hospitalized patients were eligible for enrollment. Patients with prior LVEF < 40% with subsequent improvement to ≥ 40% were also eligible for enrollment provided that ongoing HF symptoms were present and all other inclusion criteria were satisfied. Key exclusion criteria were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 mL/(min·1.73 m 2), serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L at screening or randomization, or symptomatic hypotension with mean systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg at screening or randomization. A complete list of exclusion criteria is provided in the design article. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to finerenone or a matching placebo. The starting dose was 10 mg once daily in participants with an eGFR ≤ 60 mL/(min·1.73 m 2) with a maximum maintenance dose of 20 mg once daily, whereas the starting dose was 20 mg once daily if the eGFR was > 60 mL/(min·1.73 m 2) with a maximum maintenance dose of 40 mg once daily. Ethics committees for the 653 participating institutions in 37 countries approved the protocol, and all patients gave written consent.

### Mode of death in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^115FsoDr]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The mode of death in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains poorly understood and may vary by EF.

Objective

To evaluate the mode of death according to EF and the treatment effect of finerenone on cause-specific mortality in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) randomized clinical trial, which evaluated clinical outcomes in 6001 patients with HF and EF greater than or equal to 40% randomly assigned to finerenone or placebo. The mode of death in relation to baseline EF categories (< 50%, ≥ 50- < 60%, and ≥ 60%) was examined, and the effect of randomized treatment on cause-specific death in Cox regression models was assessed. Data analysis was conducted between September 2024 and January 2025.

Interventions

Finerenone vs placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mode of death as centrally adjudicated by a clinical end points committee.

Results

Of 1013 patients (16.9%; median [IQR] age, 76 [69–82] years; 594 male [58.6%]) who died during median (IQR) follow-up of 32 (23–36) months, mode of death was ascribed to cardiovascular causes in 502 (49.6%), noncardiovascular causes in 368 (36.3%), and undetermined cause in 143 (14.1%). Of cardiovascular deaths, 215 (42.8%) were due to sudden death, 163 (32.4%) to HF, 48 (9.6%) to stroke, 25 (5.0%) to myocardial infarction, and 51 (10.2%) to other cardiovascular causes. The proportion of all-cause, cardiovascular, and sudden death was higher in those with EF less than 50%. The proportion of deaths related to HF was similar across EF categories, and the proportion of deaths due to myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular causes was low regardless of EF. Randomization to finerenone did not significantly reduce death or cause-specific death compared with placebo in any EF category.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF in the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial, higher proportions of cardiovascular and overall mortality in those with EF less than 50% were related principally to higher proportions of sudden death. A clear treatment effect of finerenone on cardiovascular or cause-specific mortality was not identified, although the trial was likely underpowered for these outcomes.

### Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of age: a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^113Z4cvM]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The interpretation of the findings from this trial must be considered in light of several limitations. Subdividing the patients by age resulted in smaller group sizes and fewer events, reducing the statistical power of these subgroup analyses. Despite these limitations, this trial represents one of the largest cohorts to date examining patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF across the age spectrum. There is always concern that patients in clinical trials are overly selected and that the efficacy and safety demonstrated in trials may not be representative of unselected real world populations. Interestingly, several recent studies have found that real world evidence has been largely consistent with trial findings.

Conclusions

Finerenone reduced the risk of HF events and cardiovascular death while also improving health-related quality of life and HF symptoms in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF across the age spectrum. Additionally, finerenone was found to be safe and well-tolerated, irrespective of age.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^115SWndJ]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

The effects of treatments for heart failure (HF) may vary among patients according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We examined the effect of finerenone according to LVEF in FINEARTS-HF.

METHODS:

FINEARTS-HF was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 40%. The treatment effect of finerenone was examined in prespecified analyses according to LVEF categories (< 50%, ≥ 50% to < 60%, and ≥ 60%) and with LVEF as a continuous variable. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death.

RESULTS:

Baseline LVEF data were available for 5993 of the 6001 participants in FINEARTS-HF. Mean and median LVEF were 53 ± 8% and 53% (interquartile range, 46%–58%), respectively. LVEF was < 50% in 2172 (36%), between 50% and < 60% in 2674 (45%), and ≥ 60% in 1147 (19%). Patients with higher LVEF were older, were more commonly female, were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, and more frequently had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease compared with those with a lower LVEF. Finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total HF events consistently across LVEF categories (LVEF < 50% rate ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68–1.03]; LVEF ≥ 50% to < 60% rate ratio, 0.80 [0.66–0.97]; and LVEF ≥ 60% rate ratio, 0.94 [0.70–1.25]; P interaction = 0.70). There was no modification of the benefit of finerenone across the range of LVEF when analyzed as a continuous variable (P interaction = 0.28). There was a similar consistent effect of finerenone on reducing the total number of worsening HF events (continuous P interaction = 0.26).

CONCLUSIONS:

In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events, irrespective of LVEF.

### Finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^114UotEy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study FINEARTS-HF (original research) was published by Scott D Solomon and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of finerenone in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF? In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the population was: 6001 patients (2732 female, 3269 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF and a LVEF ≥ 40%. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L; acute inflammatory heart disease; myocardial infarction or any event that could have led to reduced ejection fraction in the past 90 days; CABG surgery in the past 90 days. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 3003 finerenone (at a maximum dose of 20–40 mg once daily plus usual therapy) n = 2998 placebo (matching placebo once daily plus usual therapy). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of total worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes (14.9 events /100 py vs. 17.7 events /100 py; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score at 6, 9, and 12 months (8 points vs. 6.4 points; AD 1.6 points, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.3) No significant difference in improvement in NYHA functional class at 12 months (18.6% vs. 18.4%; OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.15) No significant difference in death from any cause (16.4% vs. 17.4%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF and a LVEF ≥ 40%, finerenone was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of total worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^111nxoLA]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

FINEARTS-HF was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial that examined the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared with placebo in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF. The design, baseline characteristics, and primary results have been published. – Ethics committees of the 653 participating institutions in 37 countries approved the protocol and all patients gave written consent.

Study Patients and Treatment

Key inclusion criteria were age ≥ 40 years, symptomatic HF in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II through IV, treatment with a diuretic for ≥ 30 days before randomization, and LVEF ≥ 40% with evidence of structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) measured within 12 months of screening. Patients were also required to have elevated natriuretic peptide levels (NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide] ≥ 300 pg/mL [or BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) ≥ 100 pg/mL] for patients in sinus rhythm or NT-proBNP ≥ 900 pg/mL [or BNP ≥ 300 pg/mL] for patients in atrial fibrillation) measured within 90 days in those with a recent worsening HF event within 90 days of randomization or measured 30 days before randomization in those without a recent worsening HF event. Both ambulatory and hospitalized patients were eligible for enrollment. Patients with previous LVEF < 40% with subsequent improvement to ≥ 40% were also eligible for enrollment provided that ongoing HF symptoms were present and all other inclusion criteria were satisfied. Key exclusion criteria were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 mL·min·1.73 m 2, serum/plasma potassium > 5.0 mmol/L at screening or randomization, or symptomatic hypotension with mean systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg at screening or randomization. A complete list of exclusion criteria is provided in the design article.

Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to finerenone or matching placebo. The starting dose was 10 mg once daily in participants with an eGFR ≤ 60 mL·min·1.73 m 2 with a maximum maintenance dose of 20 mg once daily, whereas the starting dose was 20 mg once daily if the eGFR was > 60 mL·min·1.73 m 2 with a maximum maintenance dose of 40 mg once daily.

### Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of age: a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^114r7hsW]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

The benefit of finerenone on the primary outcome was driven by a reduction in worsening HF events with no significant benefit on cardiovascular mortality. More importantly, we found that the benefit of finerenone, expressed as a relative risk reduction, was consistent across all age categories, with a greater absolute risk reduction in older patients. This highlights the potential risk-treatment paradox commonly identified in older patients who often have more to gain from therapies because of their higher baseline risk yet a lower probability of being prescribed such treatments.

An additional therapeutic objective in HF is to alleviate symptom burden, enhance physical function, and improve health-related quality of life, thereby improving the patient's overall health status. In the FINEARTS-HF trial, the increase in KCCQ-TSS was greater with finerenone compared with placebo, with a consistent increase observed across all age groups, including in the oldest patients. The mean overall increase in KCCQ-TSS was relatively small, but this may reflect generally mild symptoms of patients at baseline (69% NYHA functional class II), and the improvement in KCCQ-TSS was similar to that seen in other trials of pharmacotherapy for HFmrEF/HFpEF. –

The analysis of tolerability and safety was also favorable in the context of the aforementioned benefits of finerenone. For example, the proportion of patients ≥ 80 years exceeding a serum creatinine threshold of ≥ 3.0 mg/dL was 1.8% in the finerenone group versus 0.7% in the placebo group.

Additionally, while hypotension and hyperkalemia occurred more frequently with finerenone compared with placebo, across all age groups, there was no significant interaction between age and the effect of treatment on these measures. Kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension are often particular concerns in elderly patients and lead to reluctance to initiate treatment (or discontinuation of treatment). Indeed, several recent trials have shown a markedly lower use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in older compared with younger patients, for example, in the VICTORIA trial, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were used in 81% of patients < 65 years versus 56% of patients ≥ 75 years. –

Many other studies have demonstrated lower usage of a range of guideline-recommended therapies in older patients with cardiovascular disease relative to younger patients, raising concerns about ageism in prescribing. – Hopefully, the present findings are reassuring for the management of a growing and particularly high-risk population, which is often undertreated with effective therapies.

### Finerenone and outpatient worsening heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^113PXLMx]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduce outpatient worsening heart failure (HF) events requiring oral diuretic intensification among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 6001 participants, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were common and associated with greater risk of subsequent death compared with stable outpatients. Finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensifications by 11%.

Meaning

Finerenone may prevent outpatient worsening HF in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^116Q5JQj]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Why might the consistency of the benefit of finerenone across the LVEF range in HFmrEF and HFpEF be different from the previously observed attenuation of the effect of other neurohumoral modulating treatments at higher LVEF values? The first potential explanation is that finerenone has a specific mechanism (or mechanisms) of action and properties that distinguish it from other treatments and underlie its clinical benefits across the spectrum of LVEF in HFmrEF and HFpEF. Finerenone is a nonsteroidal MRA that is thought to have greater selectivity and binding affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor along with a more balanced tissue distribution between the heart and kidney than eplerenone or spironolactone. There are few direct comparisons between finerenone and other MRAs in patients with HF. In ARTS-HF (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study–Heart Failure; URL:; Unique identifier: NCT01807221), finerenone had a similar effect to eplerenone on the proportion of patients with a > 30% decrease in NT-proBNP. There was a suggestion of a greater benefit of finerenone on an exploratory clinical composite outcome; however, this trial was not powered for between-treatment comparisons on clinical outcomes.

### Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of age: a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^113F1MY9]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. It is important to understand the efficacy and safety of finerenone in these patients according to age.

Methods

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the interaction between age and the efficacy and safety of finerenone in the FINEARTS-HF trial (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Compared to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure). A total of 6001 patients aged 40 to 97 years were stratified by quartile (Q1-Q4) of baseline age: Q1, 40 to 66 years (n = 1581); Q2, 67 to 73 years (n = 1587); Q3, 74 to 79 years (n = 1421); and Q4, ≥ 80 years (n = 1412). FINEARTS-HF evaluated the impact of age on the efficacy of finerenone with respect to the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events, including heart failure hospitalization or urgent heart failure event, along with secondary efficacy and safety outcomes.

Results

The incidence of primary outcomes increased with age. Finerenone reduced the risk of the primary outcome consistently across all age categories: rate ratio in Q1, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53–0.92); Q2, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.64–1.07); Q3, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.76–1.26); and Q4, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.67–1.07); P interaction = 0.27. Similarly, a consistent effect was observed for the components of the primary outcome. The mean increase in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-total symptom score from baseline to 12 months was greater with finerenone than placebo, with a consistent effect across all age categories: mean placebo-corrected change in Q1, 2.87 (95% CI, 1.09–4.66); Q2, 1.24 (95% CI, -0.59 to 3.07); Q3, 0.94 (-0.98 to 2.86); and Q4, 1.24 (-0.90 to 3.38); P interaction = 0.50. Adverse events were similar across all age categories. The odds of experiencing hypotension, elevated creatinine, or hyperkalemia (increased) or hypokalemia (decreased) related to finerenone did not differ by age.

Conclusions

In the FINEARTS-HF trial, finerenone reduced the primary outcome and components of the primary outcome and improved symptoms across a wide age spectrum. In addition, finerenone was safe and well-tolerated, irrespective of age.

### Finerenone, serum potassium, and clinical outcomes in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^111HzpR8]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment with finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction in FINEARTS-HF, but was associated with increased levels of serum potassium in follow-up.

Objective

To investigate the frequency and predictors of serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L and less than 3.5 mmol/L and examine the treatment effect associated with finerenone, relative to placebo, on clinical outcomes based on postrandomization potassium levels.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF multicenter, randomized clinical trial, performed between September 14, 2020, and January 10, 2023, with a median follow-up of 32 months (final date of follow-up: June 14, 2024). Patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%, New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms, and elevated natriuretic peptides were included.

Intervention

Participants received finerenone or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of total worsening heart failure events or cardiovascular death.

Results

A total of 6001 participants were included (3003 randomized to receive finerenone and 2998 randomized to receive placebo). The increase in serum potassium was greater in the finerenone group than the placebo group at 1 month (median [IQR] difference, 0.19 [0.17–0.21] mmol/L) and 3 months (median [IQR] difference, 0.23 [0.21–0.25] mmol/L), which persisted for the remainder of trial follow-up. Finerenone increased the risks of potassium level increasing to greater than 5.5 mmol/L (hazard ratio [HR], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.83–2.56]; P < .001) and decreased the risks for potassium level decreasing to less than 3.5 mmol/L (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38–0.56]; P < .001). Both low (< 3.5 mmol/L; HR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.8–3.43]) and high (> 5.5 mmol/L; HR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.04–2.58]) potassium levels were associated with higher subsequent risks of the primary outcome in both treatment groups. Nevertheless, the risk of the primary outcome was generally lower in patients treated with finerenone compared with placebo, even in those whose potassium level increased to greater than 5.5 mmol/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone resulted in more frequent hyperkalemia and less frequent hypokalemia. However, with protocol-directed surveillance and dose adjustment, clinical benefit associated with finerenone relative to placebo was maintained even in those whose potassium level increased to greater than 5.5 mmol/L.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a FINE-HEART analysis [^112Shyf6]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pooling data from participants with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) from all completed outcomes trials evaluating finerenone to date may enhance understanding of its safety and efficacy in this high-risk and heterogeneous population.

Objectives

In this prespecified participant-level pooled analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD, and FINEARTS-HF trials (FINE-HEART), we evaluated the safety and efficacy of finerenone in individuals with HFmrEF/HFpEF.

Methods

The treatment effects of finerenone vs placebo on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified by trial. Additional endpoints included cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and all-cause death.

Results

Among 18,991 pooled trial participants, 7,008 (36.9%) had HFmrEF/HFpEF (mean age, 71 ± 10 years; 44% female). Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, finerenone reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization compared with placebo (HR: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.78–0.96]; P = 0.008). Consistent effects were observed across trials (P interaction = 0.24), key subgroups, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (P interaction = 0.47), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (P interaction = 0.62), and glycated hemoglobin (P interaction = 0.93). Finerenone additionally appeared to reduce heart failure hospitalization (HR: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.74–0.94]; P = 0.003) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58–0.97]; P = 0.030), but did not statistically significantly decrease cardiovascular death or all-cause death. Hyperkalemia was more common, and hypokalemia was less common, with finerenone vs placebo. Serious adverse events were similar between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

This participant-level pooled analysis of 3 large-scale outcomes trials supports the use of finerenone in individuals with HFmrEF/HFpEF across a broad range of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic risk. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42024570467).

### Estimated long-term benefits of finerenone in heart failure: a prespecified secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^1111Zgsm]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have median life expectancies that are up to 15 years shorter than persons of comparable age in community settings. Despite this survival gap, few truly disease-modifying therapies have been available in their care. Indeed, until recently, the management of HFpEF was largely empirical and centered around short-term control of symptoms, congestion, and blood pressure. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were the first evidence-based therapies to be shown to definitively reduce clinically relevant cardiovascular events in this populationand are now strongly guideline-recommended worldwide. More recently, the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, was demonstrated to reduce the risks of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events in this same population. Although these trials were conducted with mean follow-up durations of 2 to 3 years, patients with HF are often treated with medical therapies over longer-term horizons and even for their lifetimes. Because withdrawal of effective medical therapies in HF has led to early clinical deterioration, guidelines also recommend long-term treatment without interruption.

We previously developed and validated an age-based method to extrapolate within-trial observations to forecast long-term gains in event-free survival. These methods may allow for translation of traditional clinical trial reporting measures (eg, hazard ratios) to metrics that may be more interpretable by patients and clinicians (eg, years of life gained free from clinical events). In this prespecified analysis of the Finerenone Trial to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) trial, we estimated the long-term effects of finerenone on event-free survival in participants with HFmrEF or HFpEF.

### Mode of death in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^117WtYB9]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent advances in the development of effective pharmacologic treatment for patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rates of morbidity and mortality in this population remain high. Although novel therapies including angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonistsmay reduce the burden of symptoms and HF hospitalization in selected patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF, none of these has been shown to influence overall rates of death, perhaps in part due to the large proportionate contribution of noncardiovascular causes of death to mortality in this population. Mechanisms of cardiovascular death in this population remain unclear, particularly for the relatively understudied subset of patients with ongoing HF symptoms despite improvement in left ventricular EF (LVEF) to greater than 40% (HFimpEF).

Treatment with the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone was recently shown to reduce the risk of total worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes compared with placebo in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF (inclusive of HFimpEF) enrolled in the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) randomized clinical trial. In this prespecified secondary analysis, we examined the mode of death according to baseline EF and assessed the effect of finerenone treatment on the incidence of cause-specific death.

Introduction

In two large clinical trials of patients with chronic kidney disease, the non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, led to a reduction in kidney and cardiovascular events, including hospitalizations for heart failure (HF). In both trials, all participants had type 2 diabetes, and few had HF at baseline. Finerenone counteracts the pathophysiological consequences of mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation on the heart, vasculature, and kidney, which include myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, systemic hypertension, sodium retention, inflammation, and proteinuria. Antagonizing these detrimental actions should benefit patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF), including those without diabetes.

In the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure (FINEARTS‐HF), which enrolled 6001 patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF, finerenone reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death, and improved health‐related quality of life. In FINEARTS‐HF, approximately 60% of the participants did not have a history of diabetes at baseline, and this trial therefore represents the first opportunity to test the effects of finerenone in patients without diabetes. The subgroup analyses published in the main results paper for this trial demonstrated a consistent benefit of finerenone on the primary outcome. Here, we provide a detailed prespecified report of the effect of finerenone on all of the prospectively defined in FINEARTS‐HF, along with a description of safety and tolerability, according to glycaemic status.

### Baseline characteristics of patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^114yMp3V]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To describe the baseline characteristics of participants in the FINEARTS-HF trial, contextualized with prior trials including patients with heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF). The FINEARTS-HF trial is comparing the effects of the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone with placebo in reducing cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF.

Methods and Results

Patients with symptomatic HF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%, estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 25ml/min/1.73m 2, elevated natriuretic peptide levels and evidence of structural heart disease were enrolled and randomized to finerenone titrated to a maximum of 40mg once daily or matching placebo. We validly randomized 6001 patients to finerenone or placebo (mean age 72 ± 10years, 46% women). The majority were New York Heart Association functional class II (69%). The baseline mean LVEF was 53 ± 8% (range 34–84%); 36% of participants had a LVEF < 50% and 64% had a LVEF ≥ 50%. The median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 1041 (interquartile range 449–1946) pg/ml. A total of 1219 (20%) patients were enrolled during or within 7days of a worsening HF event, and 3247 (54%) patients were enrolled within 3months of a worsening HF event. Compared with prior large-scale HFmrEF/HFpEF trials, FINEARTS-HF participants were more likely to have recent (within 6months) HF hospitalization and greater symptoms and functional limitations. Further, concomitant medications included a larger percentage of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors than previous trials.

Conclusions

FINEARTS-HF has enrolled a broad range of high-risk patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF. The trial will determine the safety and efficacy of finerenone in this population.

### Finerenone, glycaemic status, and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^113aL7KA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

FINEARTS‐HF was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with symptomatic HFmrEF/HFpEF, investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared with matching placebo in addition to usual therapy. The design, baseline characteristics, and primary results of FINEARTS‐HF are published. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee at all participating institutions, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Trial patients

Key inclusion criteria were age ≥ 40 years, a diagnosis of HF, diuretic treatment for ≥ 30 days prior to randomization, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%, evidence of structural heart disease (either left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy), and elevated natriuretic peptide levels (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP] ≥ 300 pg/ml or B‐type natriuretic peptide [BNP] ≥ 100 pg/ml for patients in sinus rhythm; NT‐proBNP ≥ 900 pg/ml or BNP ≥ 300 pg/ml for patients in atrial fibrillation), measured within 30 days prior to randomization in those without a recent worsening HF event or within 90 days in those with a recent worsening HF event. Both ambulatory and hospitalized patients were eligible for enrolment. Patients with prior LVEF < 40% with subsequent improvement to ≥ 40% were also eligible for enrolment provided that ongoing HF symptoms were present. Key exclusion criteria were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or serum/plasma potassium > 5.0 mmol/L at screening or randomization; continuous (≥ 90 days) treatment with an MRA within 12 months, or treatment with an MRA within 30 days, prior to screening; systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg if not on treatment with ≥ 3 blood pressure‐lowering medications; systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg irrespective of background antihypertensive therapy; or symptomatic hypotension with mean systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at screening or at randomization. A complete list of exclusion criteria is provided in the design paper.

Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to finerenone or matching placebo. Participants with an eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 started 10 mg once daily with a maximum maintenance dose of 20 mg once daily, whereas participants with an eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 started 20 mg once daily with a maximum maintenance dose of 40 mg once daily.

### Finerenone and outpatient worsening heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^1112Jxdg]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were common and associated with elevated risk of subsequent death that was similar to adjudicated urgent HF visits requiring intravenous therapy. These results support the use of outpatient oral diuretic intensification as a clinically relevant, early marker of worsening HF. Finerenone decreased the risk of oral diuretic intensification alone and as part of an extended composite outcome including CV death, HF hospitalizations, and urgent HF visits. Reductions in worsening HF events with finerenone in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction appear to extend to the outpatient setting.

### Finerenone in heart failure with improved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^1118zRVX]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do the treatment benefits of finerenone extend to patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF)?

Findings

In this prespecified analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 6001 patients with symptomatic HF, participants with HFimpEF demonstrated similar elevated residual risk of cardiovascular events to those with left ventricular EF (LVEF) consistently 40% or higher. Finerenone, consistently reduced the relative risk in the HFimpEF population. Although hypotension was more common with finerenone in these patients, there was no difference in serious adverse events compared with those with LVEF consistently 40% or higher.

Meaning

Patients with HFimpEF remain at heightened risk of adverse outcomes, but finerenone safely and effectively mitigated this risk in this high-risk population.

### Anaemia in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^1146hAue]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Anaemia is common in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) and associated with poor clinical outcomes. While renin-angiotensin system blockers reduce haemoglobin, little is known about the effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on haemoglobin and in patients with anaemia. We evaluated the effects of finerenone according to anaemia status in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF enrolled in FINEARTS-HF. Additionally, we examined the effect of finerenone on haemoglobin, new-onset anaemia, and resolution of anaemia during follow-up.

Methods and Results

Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin < 12g/dl in women and < 13g/dl in men. The primary outcome was the composite of total (first and recurrent) heart failure events and cardiovascular death. Of 5665 patients analysed, 1584 (28.0%) had anaemia at baseline. Patients with anaemia were at higher risk of the primary endpoint compared to those without anaemia: event rate 24.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.9–26.9) versus 13.1 (95% CI 12.0–14.3) per 100 person-years; rate ratio [RR] 1.67 (95% CI 1.45–1.92). Persistence of anaemia was associated with worse outcomes compared to resolution of anaemia, and patients with new-onset anaemia had worse outcomes than those who did not develop anaemia. The effect of finerenone on the primary endpoint was consistent in patients with and without anaemia (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.73–1.10 vs. RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.64–0.91; interaction p = 0.27) and across the range of haemoglobin at baseline. Finerenone treatment did not increase the resolution of anaemia or prevent new-onset anaemia.

Conclusions

Finerenone reduces the risk of clinical outcomes regardless of anaemia status. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04435626.

### Finerenone, glycaemic status, and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^116ug9u6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The efficacy and safety of the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, have not been examined in patients without diabetes. We examined the efficacy and safety of finerenone, compared with placebo, according to glycaemic status in FINEARTS-HF.

Methods and Results

A total of 6001 patients with heart failure (HF) with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, evidence of structural heart disease, and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were randomized to finerenone or placebo. The effect of finerenone according to glycaemic status (i.e. normoglycaemia [no investigator-reported history of diabetes and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) < 5.7%], pre-diabetes [no investigator-reported history of diabetes and HbA1c 5.7–6.4%] and diabetes [investigator-reported history of diabetes or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%]) at baseline were examined. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events. At baseline, 1243 (20.8%) patients were normoglycaemic, 1979 (33.1%) had pre-diabetes, and 2764 (46.2%) had diabetes. Compared with patients with normoglycaemia, those with diabetes, but not pre-diabetes, had a higher rate of the primary endpoint (normoglycaemia: reference; pre-diabetes: adjusted rate ratio [RR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–1.23; diabetes: adjusted RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.11–1.58]). The benefit of finerenone on the primary outcome was consistent across glycaemic status (normoglycaemia: RR 0.85 [95% CI 0.63–1.14]; pre-diabetes: RR 0.85 [95% CI 0.66–1.08]; diabetes: RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69–0.98]; p interaction = 0.93). The effects of finerenone on the components of the primary outcome, all-cause death, composite kidney endpoints, and improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score were not modified by glycaemic status.

Conclusion

In patients with HF with mildly reduced/preserved ejection fraction, the beneficial effects of finerenone, compared with placebo, on clinical events and symptoms, were consistent, irrespective of glycaemic status at baseline.

### Finerenone according to frailty in heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^111Tt4Ya]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, a safe and effective therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), regardless of frailty status?

Findings

In this prespecified secondary analysis of patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF in the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF), frailty was common, and greater frailty was associated with more impairment in health status and worse clinical outcomes, including worsening HF events, hospitalizations, and death. Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the risk of worsening HF events and cardiovascular deaths and improved symptoms in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF across the range of frailty studied.

Meaning

The favorable benefit-risk balance associated with frailty for finerenone should challenge any clinical reluctance to introduce this new treatment in patients considered to be frail.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone across the ejection fraction spectrum in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^113vb4eX]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In FINEARTS-HF, the beneficial effect of finerenone on reducing the risk of cardiovascular death and the total number of HF hospitalizations was consistent across the range of LVEF in patients with HF and an LVEF ≥ 40%. These data support the use of finerenone as a foundational therapy for patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF, along with an SGLT2i.

Consistent with previous trials, we observed substantial heterogeneity according to LVEF in the clinical characteristics of patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF enrolled in FINEARTS-HF. Patients with a lower LVEF in the HFmrEF range had several features resembling a "HF with reduced ejection fraction–like" phenotype; they were more likely to be men, had a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease, and were more frequently prescribed beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin receptor antagonists (either alone or in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor). Despite evidence of benefit in HF regardless of LVEF, the use of SGLT2i was more common in those with a lower ejection fraction, probably reflecting the later approval of the use of these drugs in HFmrEF or HFpEF, which occurred during follow-up of FINEARTS-HF. Patients with a higher LVEF were older, were more often women, and had less ischemic heart disease, but a greater prevalence of hypertension, higher body mass index, and lower eGFR. Natriuretic peptide concentrations were lower with increasing LVEF.

Conclusions

In this prespecified analysis of a randomized clinical trial of patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF, the non‐steroidal MRA, finerenone, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events, and was well‐tolerated, independent of glycaemic status.

Introduction

Patients with heart failure (HF) experience periods of stability interrupted by episodes of worsening symptoms and volume retention requiring diuresis. Hospitalization for worsening HF is associated with high subsequent risk for rehospitalization and death and therefore has traditionally been included as an outcome in clinical trials of HF therapies. Financial incentives and patient preferences are increasingly moving care for worsening HF to the outpatient or even telehealth setting. Outpatient worsening HF events treated with intravenous loop diuretic have been shown to also predict poor prognosis and have therefore been added to clinical trial primary composite outcomes, but they have proven to be rare (< 15% the rate of HF hospitalization).

Initiation or increase in the dosage of oral diuretics occurs far more frequently than intravenous treatment. In previous trials, this was associated with a 2.5- to 3-fold greater risk of subsequent mortality compared with stable outpatients, which was similar to outpatient intravenous diuretic administration, although less than HF hospitalization. Oral diuretic intensification may be an early marker of worsening HF, identifying patients with high absolute benefit from programs to manage congestion or optimize guideline-directed medical therapy. It remains unknown whether the type of diuretic change (loop or thiazide) or the degree of dosage intensification influences subsequent prognosis.

The Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) compared the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone with placebo in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction who were using either a loop or thiazide diuretic at baseline. Finerenone reduced the primary outcome of total worsening HF events (hospitalization or urgent HF visit requiring intravenous diuretic) and cardiovascular (CV) death by 16%. Outpatient oral diuretic intensification — defined as initiations or increases in the dosage of loop diuretics or initiation of thiazide diuretics — was a prespecified exploratory outcome in the FINEARTS-HF trial. In this study, we investigated the frequency and prognostic significance of worsening HF events treated with hospitalization, outpatient intravenous diuretic administration, or oral diuretic intensification as well as the effect of finerenone on the risk for these events.

### Effects of finerenone on natriuretic peptide levels in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^1134vd7h]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) concentrations in plasma are widely used for diagnosis and risk stratification in patients with heart failure (HF). Changes in NT‐proBNP in response to therapy have correlated closely with treatment effects on HF hospitalizations in previous clinical trials. The non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduced NT‐proBNP concentrations by 18% at 4 months in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) in the FINEARTS‐HF (FINerenone trial to investigate Efficacy and sAfety superioR to placebo in paTientS with Heart Failure) trial, finerenone reduced the primary outcome of total HF events and cardiovascular death by 16%, but its effect on NT‐proBNP in this population is not known.

We investigated the treatment effect of finerenone across baseline concentrations of NT‐proBNP and on NT‐proBNP concentrations over time in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF in the FINEARTS‐HF trial.

### Finerenone and outpatient worsening heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^112G3S2z]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction enrolled in the FINEARTS-HF trial, outpatient worsening HF events were common, associated with poor prognosis, and reduced by the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone. Outpatient oral diuretic intensification was common, occurring in 21% of patients. Despite the absence of central adjudication or requirement of symptoms or signs of worsening HF, oral diuretic intensification was associated with a rate of subsequent death that was at least double that of stable outpatients and similar to centrally adjudicated urgent HF visits requiring intravenous therapy. Finerenone decreased the risk of oral diuretic intensification alone and as part of an extended composite outcome including CV death and worsening HF events. These results support the use of outpatient oral diuretic intensification as an early marker of worsening HF and indicate that the benefit of finerenone in decreasing worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction extends to the outpatient setting.

Our findings are consistent with and extend previous work demonstrating that outpatient oral diuretic intensification events are common and associated with poor prognosis in patients with chronic HF. The Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trial, which enrolled a similar patient population with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, found a 2- to 3-fold greater risk of death after outpatient oral diuretic intensification compared with stable outpatients, which is consistent with the FINEARTS-HF trial. In the patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, the relative increase in risk of death following outpatient oral diuretic intensification was at least as strong, approximately 3-fold in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trialand 4- to 5-fold in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI [angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor] With ACEI [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial. Consistent findings across multiple trials and ejection fraction groups reinforce that outpatient oral diuretic intensification is an early marker of worsening HF with prognostic value.

### Interplay of serum potassium and kidney function with finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: findings from FINEARTS-HF [^112yNEFT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Finerenone improved heart failure (HF) outcomes in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF). Clinical decision-making around initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists often relies on measures of kidney function and serum potassium (K +) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone across categories of serum K + and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Methods and Results

Four mutually exclusive categories were created: (1) K + ≤ 4.5mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2; (2) K + > 4.5mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2; (3) K + ≤ 4.5mmol/L and eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m 2; and (4) K + > 4.5mmol/L and eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m 2. Outcomes and treatment effects were compared across these categories. The primary outcome was a composite of total HF events and cardiovascular death. The median follow-up was 32months. A total of 6001 patients were included. Compared to patients with K + ≤ 4.5mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2, those with eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m 2, irrespective of K + levels, had a 1.5- to 2-fold higher risk of experiencing primary outcome and fatal events across treatment groups. No significant interaction was observed on the effects of finerenone (vs. placebo) on the primary outcome across K + /eGFR categories. The respective risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were: (1) K + ≤ 4.5mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2: RR 0.66, 95% CI0.52–0.85; (2) K + > 4.5mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65–1.30; (3) K + ≤ 4.5mmol/L and eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m 2: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74–1.13; (4) K + > 4.5mmol/L and eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m 2: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72–1.17; p for interaction = 0.20. Patients with low eGFR and/or high K + experienced more frequent adverse events and treatment discontinuation; still, categories of K + /eGFR did not significantly modify the relative risk of adverse events with finerenone versus placebo (p for interaction > 0.1 for all adverse events).

Conclusions

No significant heterogeneity was found on the effect of finerenone to reduce primary outcome events. Still, adverse events and treatment discontinuation were more frequent among patients with low eGFR and/or high K +, suggesting. that such patients may require tailored strategies to mitigate adverse events and avoid treatment discontinuation.

### Finerenone in heart failure with improved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^1157UgNG]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Advancements managing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have led to a growing population of patients with heart failure with improved EF (HFimpEF). However, knowledge gaps persist due to the historical lack of a standardized definition and exclusion of HFimpEF from major HF trials. This analysis examines clinical profiles, risk, and finerenone response in patients with HFimpEF compared with those with LVEF consistently 40% or higher who were enrolled in Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) study.

### Finerenone, glycaemic status, and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^114sD7ra]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects of finerenone on clinical outcomes according to glycaemic status

The effects of steroidal MRAs according to glycaemic status have been examined in both patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HFpEF. In two HFrEF trials, RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF, the beneficial effects of steroidal MRAs spironolactone and eplerenone, respectively, on clinical outcomes, including HF hospitalizations and mortality, were evident in both patients with and without diabetes at baseline.

Before FINEARTS‐HF, the effects of the non‐steroidal MRA, finerenone, had not been evaluated in large clinical trials of patients without diabetes, since both FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD tested finerenone in individuals with type 2 diabetes across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease. In this prespecified analysis of FINEARTS‐HF, we demonstrated that the efficacy of finerenone on a range of clinical outcomes was not modified by a history of diabetes or glycaemic status at baseline. Specifically, finerenone, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events, as well as first and total worsening HF events, regardless of glycaemic status. Because patients with diabetes were at higher absolute risk, their absolute benefit was greater. Moreover, the benefits of finerenone were similar in participants with diabetes despite a relatively high rate of background SGLT2 inhibitor use in these individuals. Conversely, in TOPCAT, spironolactone did not show a significant reduction in the primary endpoint in patients with HFpEF although in a post hoc analysis restricted to patients enrolled in North and South America, there was a benefit, and this was consistent in patients with and without diabetes.

### Tailoring medical therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112R6SgF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of the hospitalization for heart failure (HF) worldwide, and the prevalence is expected to increase along with population aging and increasing burden of cardio‐kidney‐metabolic disorders. Treatment options for chronic HFpEF have expanded in recent years. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are now guideline‐recommended as a first‐line treatment in patients with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction. In a meta‐analysis of the EMPEROR‐Preserved and DELIVER trials, SGLT2i reduced cardiovascular (CV) death or first hospitalization for HF by 20% with consistent reductions in both components (12% risk reduction in CV death and 26% risk reduction in first hospitalization for HF), among HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40%. In the PARAGON‐HF trial, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan led to a marginal reduction of total hospitalizations for HF and CV death compared to valsartan in patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 45%, with a more pronounced benefit observed in those with an LVEF below normal. Based on the results of this trial, sacubitril/valsartan received indications for use in patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and selected patients with HFpEF with an LVEF below normal in the United States. Lastly, in the FINEARTS‐HF trial, the non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone showed a 16% relative risk reduction of worsening HF events and death from CV causes compared to placebo among patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 40%.

These advances in HFpEF pharmacotherapy, along with the substantial residual risk of this population, highlight the need for an accelerated optimization of foundational medical therapy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of finerenone according to the use and dosage of diuretics: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^117BdMMk]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Given their kidney actions, it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists when combined with other diuretics and whether they have a so-called diuretic-sparing effect in patients with heart failure (HF).

Objective

To examine the efficacy and tolerability of finerenone related to background diuretic treatment in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study is a prespecified secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted across 653 sites in 37 countries among adults aged 40 years and older with HFmrEF/HFpEF, who were randomized between September 2020 and January 2023. Data analysis was conducted from December 1, 2024, to January 30, 2025.

Intervention

Finerenone (titrated to 20 mg or 40 mg) or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of total HF events and cardiovascular death. Outcomes were compared between finerenone and placebo according to the following baseline diuretic categories: only a nonloop diuretic (thiazide or thiazide-like); loop diuretic (≤ 40 mg vs > 40 mg furosemide-equivalent dose); and combined nonloop and loop diuretic use.

Results

Among 5438 patients, 2496 (45.9%) were female, and mean (SD) age was 72.1 (9.6) years. A total of 684 patients (12.6%) were receiving a nonloop diuretic, 3040 (55.9%) less than or equal to 40 mg furosemide equivalent, 1145 (21.1%) 40 mg or greater furosemide equivalent, and 569 (10.5%) both nonloop and loop diuretics. Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the risk of the primary end point across all diuretic subgroups: rate ratios were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.47–1.51), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72–1.02), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78–1.24), and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.35–0.83) for patients in the nonloop, 40 mg or less loop, more than 40 mg loop, and combined nonloop and loop categories, respectively (P for interaction = .18). Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced loop diuretic dose and dose intensification, but not loop diuretic initiation. Safety was consistent across diuretic categories.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of finerenone were consistent across all diuretic subgroups. Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the use of diuretics in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF; however, finerenone did not reduce the initiation of new loop diuretic in participants not receiving a loop diuretic at baseline.

### Finerenone in patients with severe heart failure: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^112TGD9z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

While patients with severe heart failure (HF) were historically considered to have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), it is increasingly recognized that severe HF occurs across the full spectrum of LVEF. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence, cardiovascular (CV) outcome risk, and treatment response to the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone among patients with severe HF in FINEARTS-HF.

Methods and Results

Treatment effects of finerenone on the primary endpoint of total (first and recurrent) HF events and CV death were assessed by severe HF status, as defined by the adapted multiparametric ESC-HFA criteria including New York heart Association functional class III/IV, hospitalization for HF within the previous 12months, and impairment of health status measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score < 75. Overall, 888 (14.8%) patients fulfilled the definition for severe HF. Patients with severe HF were older, with a higher comorbidity burden, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Over a median follow-up of 2.7years, total HF events and CV death occurred at a higher rate among those with severe HF (31.6 per 100patient-years [py]) as compared to those without severe HF (13.9 per 100py). Finerenone was beneficial in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint regardless of severe HF status (p interaction = 0.98), with a greater absolute rate reduction in those with severe HF (5.9 per 100py) compared with those without severe HF (2.2 per 100py) in light of higher baseline risk. The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason or experienced adverse events according to treatment assignment was similar regardless of severe HF status.

Conclusions

Among patients with mildly reduced or preserved LVEF, severe HF was associated with a heightened risk of CV events. Treatment with finerenone appeared safe and effective, regardless of HF severity.

### Nonsteroidal and steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists: rationale, evidence, and unanswered questions [^114yKMEh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have demonstrated substantial benefits in randomized controlled trials for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, their effectiveness in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains uncertain, and the implementation of this class has remained low, in part due to its side effects and tolerability profile. Emerging therapies that target the mineralocorticoid receptor and/or the production of aldosterone may offer alternative strategies to treat the aldosterone-mineralocorticoid receptor axis. For instance, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has shown efficacy in reducing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as decreasing the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction populations. Large-scale, direct comparative outcome studies are currently lacking that compare steroidal MRAs vs emerging therapies. This review critically assesses the structural and mechanistic distinctions between nonsteroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs as well as mineralocorticoid receptor modulators and aldosterone synthase inhibitors; summarizes available evidence across heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease populations; and highlights ongoing and forthcoming research aimed at addressing key unanswered questions in this rapidly evolving therapeutic field.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and potential for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major and growing public health concern with limited treatment options. HFpEF is defined as HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.HF with a reduced ejection fraction has previously been defined as LVEF < 40% and more recently ≤ 40%. Trials in HFpEF have generally included HFpEF but also patients with HF with mid‐range or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), defined as LVEF 40–49% and more recently 41–49%.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is thought to be characterized in part by comorbidity‐driven systemic inflammation, microvascular endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis, leading to increased cardiomyocyte, interstitial and vascular stiffness, resulting in the HF syndrome despite a preserved or normal ejection fraction. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors reduce these maladaptive processes, but five HFpEF randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system did not meet their primary endpoints. As of 2024, only sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 and 1 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular (CV) death in HFpEF.

In the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial, enrolling patients with signs and symptoms of HF, an LVEF ≥ 45%, and either recent HF hospitalization or elevated natriuretic peptides (NPs), spironolactone did not significantly reduce the composite of death from CV causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF. However, post‐hoc analyses of patients randomized in North and South Americaand of patients included based on NPssuggested that spironolactone may be effective in reducing the composite of HF hospitalization and CV death. Nevertheless, conclusive evidence to recommend mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in HFpEF is still lacking. A trial with the non‐steroidal MRA finerenone in HFpEF and HFmrEF is currently ongoing. A summary of key completed and ongoing trials in HFpEF/HFmrEF targeting the aldosterone–mineralocorticoid receptor pathway is shown in Table 1.

### Finerenone, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^113YefZh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

These observations, coupled with the findings from prior trials of MRAs in HFrEF and other therapies in both HFrEF and HFmrEF/HFpEF, strongly suggest that the effect modification by pulmonary disease status observed in TOPCAT may have resulted from the play of chance. Our findings are consistent with data from two separate trials in HFrEF (RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF) with two different steroidal MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) which showed that the beneficial effects of steroidal MRA treatment were consistent in patients with and without COPD.

In addition to preventing hospitalizations and reducing mortality, improving patients' health status is a key goal of HF management, and this is all the more important in patients with COPD, who have a considerably greater symptom burden and worse physical function and quality of life than those without. Therefore, it was important to show that finerenone was as effective in increasing (improving) the mean KCCQ‐TSS after 12 months of treatment in patients with COPD as it was in individuals without COPD. Although finerenone, compared with placebo, did not improve NYHA functional class at 12 months in FINEARTS‐HF overall, there was a borderline statistically significant interaction between COPD status and the effect of finerenone on this outcome, suggesting that finerenone improved NYHA functional class in patients with COPD, but not in those without. Given that the interaction tests were not sufficiently powered and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, this borderline interaction could constitute a chance finding.

Increases in potassium and creatinine levels and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (to < 100 mmHg) were more common in the finerenone group than in the placebo group, whereas hypokalaemia was less common with finerenone. These effects were generally consistent regardless of COPD status. However, the magnitude of the effect of finerenone in reducing the risk of hypokalaemia appeared to be greater in patients without COPD, possibly due to a lower use of loop diuretics and beta‐2‐adrenoreceptor agonists (both of which induce hypokalaemia) in these patients.

Taken together, these data underscore the clinically meaningful benefits and tolerability of finerenone in individuals with HFmrEF/HFpEF, regardless of COPD status and provide further evidence for finerenone as a new treatment option for patients with HF and COPD.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure: an update [^112LuJpH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), has been used to treat patients with heart failure (HF) for more than half a century. Spironolactone improved outcomes in patients with severely symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction, and later, eplerenone expanded the benefits to patients with mildly symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction and myocardial infarction complicated by HF. Spironolactone reduced HF events in some patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, but the results were not generalizable to all patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. More recently, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone improved the HF outcomes of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, expanding the benefits previously seen among patients with diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease. The use of MRAs has been limited due to excessive concern about hyperkalemia. Education about the limited true risk associated with hyperkalemia, and about how to predict, prevent, and manage hyperkalemia, may lead to wider acceptability and use of these agents. Several ongoing trials are testing steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs in HF populations. In this review, we perform a critical appraisal of MRA use in HF populations and point toward future directions.

### Finerenone in heart failure with improved ejection fraction: the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^116vKL5A]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, in this high-risk cohort of patients with HF, finerenone demonstrated consistent safety and efficacy in reducing adverse CV outcomes regardless of prior history of LVEF less than 40%. Although hypotension related to finerenone was more common in patients with HFimpEF, the safety and tolerability profile of finerenone was otherwise similar to the rest of the trial population. These findings support the safety and efficacy of finerenone in patients with HFimpEF and emphasize the ongoing need for optimized medical management to address residual risks in HFimpEF.

### Finerenone, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial [^112zHH4z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF), and individuals with both conditions have a substantially worse prognosis than those with either condition alone. Consequently, there is a need for effective therapies in these high‐risk individuals with concomitant HFmrEF/HFpEF and COPD.

Although a history of COPD does not appear to modify the beneficial effects of guideline‐recommended therapies in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) nor sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in HFmrEF/HFpEF, there is some evidence that the effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be modified by COPD status in HFmrEF/HFpEF. In a post hoc analysis of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial (TOPCAT) (Americas only), the effect of the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, compared with placebo, on cardiovascular and all‐cause death was modified by a history of pulmonary disease (COPD or asthma), such that the risk reduction with spironolactone was greater among those with pulmonary disease compared to those without. The authors of this analysis speculated that aldosterone may play a role in the reduction in alveolar surface area in COPD, proliferation of alveolar type II cells, thickening of the alveolar‐capillary interstitium, and lung fibrosis. Spironolactone has also been shown to improve lung diffusion capacity in patients with HF.

However, TOPCAT did not show a significant benefit of spironolactone overall, and, therefore, before the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure trial (FINEARTS‐HF), the benefits of MRAs in HFmrEF/HFpEF were unproven and their effects according to COPD status in these patients remained uncertain.

Consequently, we examined the efficacy and safety of the non‐steroidal MRA, finerenone, compared with placebo, according to a history of COPD in a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS‐HF, which demonstrated that finerenone reduced the risk of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death and improved health‐related quality of life in 6001 patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF.

### Effects of the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone with and without concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor use in heart failure [^114jgYw8]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction face heightened long-term risks of morbidity and mortality. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone have both been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in this population, but the effects of their combined use are not known.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of finerenone in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%. Baseline SGLT2i use was a prespecified subgroup. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death. We first assessed for evidence of treatment heterogeneity on the basis of baseline SGLT2i use. We further examined SGLT2i uptake during the trial and evaluated the treatment effects of finerenone accounting for baseline and during-trial use of SGLT2i in time-varying analyses.

Results

Among 6001 participants, 817 (13.6%) were treated with an SGLT2i at baseline. During 2.6 years median follow-up, treatment with finerenone similarly reduced the risk of the primary outcome in participants treated with an SGLT2i (rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60–1.16]) and without an SGLT2i at baseline (rate ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74–0.98]; P interaction = 0.76). In follow-up, 980 participants initiated SGLT2i, which was less frequent in the finerenone arm compared with placebo (17.7% versus 20.1%; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76–0.97]). Time-updated analyses accounting for baseline and subsequent use of SGLT2i did not meaningfully alter the treatment effects of finerenone on the primary end point.

Conclusions

The treatment benefits of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone were observed irrespective of concomitant use of an SGLT2i. These data suggest that the combined use of SGLT2i and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist may provide additive protection against cardiovascular events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116Z95cR]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finerenone is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist (MRA) with high binding affinity, high MR selectivity and a short plasma half-life. In two major endpoint-driven clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD), finerenone induced significant cardiorenal protective actions, and has been recently approved for treatment of these patients. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a devastating clinical syndrome with increasing prevalence and poor prognosis. Pharmacological therapy of HFpEF is very limited and new therapeutic options are urgently needed. Finerenone has been shown to improve multiple pathophysiological parameters of HFpEF in preclinical models. In consonance, pre-specified subgroup analyses of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD suggested a potential beneficial effect of finerenone in HFpEF. This review will discuss the pharmacodynamic and -kinetic profile of finerenone. We will provide a general overview over the complex pathophysiology of HFpEF and data from pre-clinical studies, focusing on how finerenone improves multiple components of this pathophysiology. Finally, we will discuss current and future clinical trials with finerenone in heart failure patients focusing on HFpEF.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure: an individual patient level meta-analysis [^11591dF5]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce hospitalisations and death in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but the benefit in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear. We evaluated the effect of MRAs in four trials that enrolled patients with heart failure across the range of ejection fraction.

Methods

This is a prespecified, individual patient level meta-analysis of the RALES (spironolactone) and EMPHASIS-HF (eplerenone) trials, which enrolled patients with HFrEF, and of the TOPCAT (spironolactone) and FINEARTS-HF (finerenone) trials, which enrolled patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was a composite of time to first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. We also estimated the effect of MRAs on components of this composite, total (first or repeat) heart failure hospitalisations (with and without cardiovascular deaths), and all-cause death. Safety outcomes were also assessed, including serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum potassium, and systolic blood pressure. An interaction between trials and treatment was tested to examine the heterogeneity of effect in these populations. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024541487.

Findings

13846 patients were included in the four trials. MRAs reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.72–0.83]). There was a statistically significant interaction by trials and treatment (p for interaction = 0.0012) due to the greater efficacy in HFrEF (0.66 [0.59–0.73]) compared with HFmrEF or HFpEF (0.87 [0.79–0.95]). We observed significant reductions in heart failure hospitalisation in the HFrEF trials (0.63 [0.55–0.72]) and the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.82 [0.74–0.91]). The same pattern was observed for total heart failure hospitalisations with or without cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular death was reduced in the HFrEF trials (0.72 [0.63–0.82]) but not in the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.92 [0.80–1.05]). All-cause death was also reduced in the HFrEF trials (0.73 [0.65–0.83]) but not in the HFmrEF or HFpEF trials (0.94 [0.85–1.03]). With an MRA, the risk of hyperkalaemia was doubled compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.27 [95% CI 2.02–2.56]), but the incidence of serious hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) was low (2.9% vs 1.4%); the risk of hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) was halved (0.51 [0.45–0.57]; 7% vs 14%).

Interpretation

Steroidal MRAs reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation in patients with HFrEF and non-steroidal MRAs reduce this risk in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116FzM5u]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

HFpEF is a clinical syndrome accounting for over 50% of the estimated 64.3 million heart failure patients worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of HFpEF patients is 69.8% and is not significantly different from patients with HFrEF. The underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial and mainly driven by non-cardiac conditions and comorbidities such as hypertension, T2DM, obesity, and CKD, among which hypertension is one of the most prevalent. So far therapeutic options to reduce morbidity and mortality in HFpEF are very limited. Recently, SGLT2-inhibitors showed significant benefit on heart failure hospitalization rates and are now recommended in patients with HFpEF. New effective therapeutic options are imperative to alleviate the suffering of these patients. Based on their mechanism of action, on preclinical data and post-hoc analysis of clinical trials, MRA represent a promising alternative for future HFpEF therapy.

In summary, this review will discuss the pharmacology of the novel non-steroidal MRA, finerenone, and its potential use for the treatment of patients with HFpEF.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^1128gcUL]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone In The Treatment of Heart Failure (SPIRIT-HF) and Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT) are 2 distinct ongoing trials comparing spironolactone to placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of recurrent HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in symptomatic HF patients (NYHA II–IV) with mid-range (LVEF 40%–49%) or preserved LVEF (≥ 50%) (and NCT02901184).

Finerenone is a nonsteroidal selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that has been investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD)(n = 7,347), the primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events (time to cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF) and the secondary endpoint was a composite of kidney events (time to kidney failure, sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, or renal death). In Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD)(n = 5,734), primary and secondary endpoints were the reverse (kidney and cardiovascular). Among the enrolled patients, > 95% had treated hypertension, 46% had a history of cardiovascular disease, and only 7% had a history of HF. Yet, in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, a reduction in the primary cardiovascular endpoint was obtained, but the main and only secondary benefit of finerenone was a significant reduction in hospitalizations for HF (HR = 0.78, 0.66–0.92, P = 0.003). Thus, further evidence obtained from HF patients is needed to implement this medication in HF treatment. The Finerenone in Heart Failure Patients (FINEARTS-HF)is an ongoing multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone on morbidity and mortality in patients with HF (NYHA II–IV) and LVEF ≥ 40%.

Aldosterone synthase inhibition is a third concept focused on reducing aldosterone activity, and at least 1 compound, baxdrostat, has advanced well into clinical development (Table 3). This compound is well tolerated and lowers blood pressure significantly.

### Finerenone for heart failure and risk estimated by the PREDICT-HFpEF model: a secondary analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^116q5x4k]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with heart failure (HF) and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have a spectrum of risk, and the effect of therapies may vary by risk.

Objectives

To validate the Prognostic Models for Mortality and Morbidity in HFpEF (PREDICT-HFpEF) in the phase 3 randomized clinical trial Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) and to evaluate the effect of finerenone, compared with placebo, across the spectrum of risk in these patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The FINEARTS-HF trial was conducted across 653 sites in 37 countries. Participants were adults 40 years and older with symptomatic HF and left ventricular EF of 40% or greater randomized between September 2020 and January 2023.

Intervention

Finerenone (titrated to 20 mg or 40 mg) or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 3 PREDICT-HFpEF risk scores for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death, respectively, were calculated. Predicted risk was compared with observed outcomes. Model performance was assessed using the Harrell C statistic. The rates of the predicted outcomes (plus the composite of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events, which was the primary end point in the trial) were examined according to quintiles of risk score, as was the effect of finerenone according to risk quintiles.

Results

A total of 6001 patients (mean [SD] age, 72 [9.6] years; 3269 male [54.5%]) were randomized in the FINEARTS-HF trial. The C statistics for cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death at 2 years were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.72), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.66–0.71), and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67–0.71), respectively. The risk of the composite outcomes was approximately 8- to 10-fold higher in those in the highest compared with the lowest risk quintile. The relative risk reduction with finerenone compared with placebo was consistent across the spectrum of risk for all outcomes examined (eg, interaction P value for primary outcome = .24).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial demonstrate that the PREDICT-HFpEF models performed well in terms of calibration and discrimination. Baseline risk did not modify the benefit of finerenone.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116RQNmy]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Finerenone is a novel, highly selective non-steroidal MRA with high binding affinity and short plasma half-life. In two major endpoint-driven clinical trials in patients with CKD and T2DM (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD), finerenone induces significant cardiorenal protective actions. Beyond these results, finerenone has shown to improve multiple pathophysiological parameters of HFpEF in preclinical models. In consonance, pre-specified subgroup analyses of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD suggested a potential beneficial effect of finerenone in HFpEF.

HFpEF is a devastating clinical syndrome with increasing prevalence and poor prognosis. Unfortunately, current guideline-recommend drug therapy in HFpEF is very limited with only one prognosis-improving drug class, SGLT2-inhibitors. Against this background, the potential beneficial effects of finerenone in HFpEF appear very promising. The final efficacy/ risk profile of finerenone in HFpEF is currently being investigated in over 6.000 patients in the FINEARTS-HF study, the results of which are desperately awaited to allow this drug to be used in the treatment of HFpEF.

### Finerenone across the spectrum of kidney risk in heart failure: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^112CQGZH]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio are complementary domains of kidney disease staging and independently associated with heart failure (HF) progression.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the efficacy and safety of finerenone varies according to kidney risk among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure), clinical outcomes and treatment effects of finerenone on the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death and total [first and recurrent] HF events) and key secondary endpoints were evaluated according to baseline KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) risk category (low, moderately increased, and high or very high). Key exclusion criteria in FINEARTS-HF were eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L.

Results

Overall, 5,797 (97%) FINEARTS-HF participants had classifiable KDIGO risk category at baseline, of whom 2,022 (35%), 1,688 (29%), and 2,087 (36%) were low, moderate, and high/very high risk, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, higher kidney risk was associated with a higher rate of primary outcome events, with similar findings for other key endpoints, including the composite kidney outcome, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and vascular events. Benefits of finerenone vs placebo on the primary endpoint (P interaction = 0.24) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Total Symptom Score at 12 months (P interaction = 0.36) were consistent irrespective of baseline kidney risk category. Participants with higher kidney risk experienced greater reductions in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio after 6 months (P interaction = 0.031), without differences in eGFR slope. Risks of safety events, including hyperkalemia, with finerenone vs placebo were not enhanced among participants with higher kidney risk.

Conclusions

Finerenone appears to consistently improve clinical outcomes, HF-related health status, and albuminuria across a broad spectrum of kidney risk in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

In patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%), the CVOTs EMPEROR-preservedand DELIVERdemonstrated a significant reduction combined endpoint of HF hospitalization or CV with the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin or dapagliflozin, respectively, compared with placebo. Both trials enrolled patients with an eGFR down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (EMPEROR-preserved) and 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (DELIVER). In prespecified subgroup analyses, no significant difference was found between patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, suggesting that patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF and CKD benefit from treatment with one of these SGLT2 inhibitors.

The FINEARTS-HF study investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 40% including patients with an eGFR down to 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Over a median period of 32 months, finerenone led to a significant 16% relative reduction of the combined primary endpoint of total (first and recurrent HF events) and CV deaths; these results were mainly driven by a significant reduction in the total number of HF exacerbations (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71–0.94; P = 0.006). The reduction in CV death was not significant. There was no difference between the finerenone and placebo groups in all-cause mortality or a composite kidney endpoint. Serious adverse events were comparable in both groups (finerenone: 38.7%; placebo: 40.5%). Finerenone increased the risk of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia (9.7% vs 4.2%) but decreased the risk of hypokalaemia (4.4% vs 9.7%). Forty-eight percent of patients in this study had an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2; there was no significant difference for the primary endpoint in the subgroups with and without CKD.FINEHEART, a prespecified analysis of FIDELIO-CKD, FIGARO-CKD, and FINEARTS-HF showed consistent benefits of finerenone on cardio-kidney outcomes in patients with a high burden of cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116TctRx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) belongs to the family of nuclear hormone receptors. Pharmacological blockade of the MR by MR-antagonists (MRA) in renal epithelial cells results in a reduction of sodium and water reabsorption. More importantly, inhibition of MR activity in cardiovascular cells including cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, and in cells of the innate and adaptive immune system mediates potent anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory actions thereby improving cardiac function. MRA, in particular steroidal MRA are routinely used to treat primary hyperaldosteronism, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and therapy-resistant hypertension. Steroidal MRA have become one of the four first-line therapies for HFrEF, next to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blockers and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Their role in HFpEF therapy is less clear and will be discussed in this review.

Recently, a new class of MRA has been developed, named non-steroidal MRA, among which finerenone is the one with the most advanced global clinical development program. In two phase 3 clinical trials (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD), finerenone improved the cardiovascular and renal outcome of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) significantly. These results led to the approval of finerenone by the FDA and the EMA in 2021/22 for the treatment of patients with CKD and T2DM to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, CV death, nonfatal heart attacks and hospitalization for heart failure. Compared to steroidal MRA, finerenone exerts a different binding mode to the MR-ligand binding domain, as a bulky antagonist, thereby leading to distinct MR-target gene regulation which translates into distinct cardiorenal effects and clinical actions. In preclinical and clinical studies, finerenone has been shown to induce cardioprotective actions, to decrease levels of BNP and NT-proBNP and to reduce the risk of incident heart failure in patients with CKD and T2DM. This review will discuss preclinical and clinical data on finerenone in heart failure focusing on its future role in HFpEF therapy.

### Cardiovascular efficacy and safety of finerenone: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117CmaPi]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, although our analysis demonstrated a trend of reduced CV death with finerenone, statistical significance was not achieved. These results are consistent with earlier studies, where finerenone did not demonstrate a reduction in MI or CV death. This finding suggests that while finerenone provides clear benefits in HF‐related outcomes, it may not have a substantial impact on direct coronary events. This can be explained by the fact that HF management and coronary disease require distinct therapeutic strategies, and finerenone's primary action on the mineralocorticoid receptor may not address the underlying atherosclerotic processes that drive MI. Further studies, including in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction are needed to clarify potential effects on CV death.

Additionally, our study identified a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia in the finerenone group. This finding is consistent with the known class effects of MRAs. Hyperkalemia remains a well‐recognized adverse effect, and its management is crucial to maintaining patient safety, particularly in patients with HF and chronic kidney disease. However, in contrast to earlier studies, our analysis did not find significant differences in the overall incidence of adverse effects, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation between finerenone and control. These findings suggest that, despite the increased risk of hyperkalemia, finerenone is otherwise well‐tolerated, with an overall safety profile comparable to placebo.

The FINEARTS‐HF trial significantly contributes to our understanding of finerenone's efficacy. By focusing on CV outcomes, it addresses a critical gap in the literature and offers new insights into how finerenone can be used as a potential therapeutic agent in managing HF. The FINEARTS‐HF findings support the importance of finerenone in lowering CV risk, especially when it comes to HF‐related outcomes, which were not adequately addressed in earlier analyses.

Our findings also reinforce the importance of long‐term management strategies in high‐risk HF patients. The reduced risk of hospitalization or unplanned visits in the finerenone group suggests a significant impact on patient quality of life, healthcare resource utilization, and overall disease management. These benefits, when combined with a favorable safety profile, make finerenone a valuable addition to HF management. To fully understand finerenone's role in CV care, future research should concentrate on examining its long‐term CV results, particularly in different patient populations.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114mj4ZA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent publications confirmed the protective actions of finerenone in cardiorenal disease. A large network meta-analysis showed that in patients with T2DM and CKD, finerenone led to a risk reduction in MACE, renal outcomes and hospitalization for heart failure. Certain patient subgroups including non-albuminuric CKD patients seem to be usually underrepresented in the finerenone RCTs. In this regard, the FIDELITY prespecified pooled analysis of the combined data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD revealed that finerenone reduced the risk of clinically important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of CKD in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, compared with placebo, finerenone improved heart failure-related outcomes in patients with CKD and T2DM, with consistent benefit across eGFR and/ or UACR. In summary, these data convincingly demonstrate that the non-steroidal MRA finerenone induces cardiorenal protection in patients with CKD and T2DM which led to its approval by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of adults with CKD and T2DM to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, CV-death, non-fatal heart attacks, and hospitalization for heart failure.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: integrating evidence into clinical practice [^117X5UBu]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and mild-to-severe symptoms, and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These clinical benefits are observed in addition to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The morbidity and mortality benefits of MRAs may be mediated by several proposed actions, including antifibrotic mechanisms that slow heart failure progression, prevent or reverse cardiac remodelling, or reduce arrhythmogenesis. Both eplerenone and spironolactone have demonstrated survival benefits in individual clinical trials. Pharmacologic differences exist between the drugs, which may be relevant for therapeutic decision making in individual patients. Although serious hyperkalaemia events were reported in the major MRA clinical trials, these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. When used appropriately, MRAs significantly improve outcomes across the spectrum of patients with HF-REF.

The second phase III trial, FIGARO-DKD was conducted in a similar patient population as FIDELIO-DKD and focusses with its primary CV-composite endpoint (time to CV death, nonfatal MI or stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) on CV morbidity and mortality. 7.437 randomized patients had earlier stage CKD compared to FIDELIO-DKD, defined by UACR 30 to < 300 mg/g and eGFR 25 to ≤ 90mL/min/1.73m 2 or UACR ≥ 300 mg/g and eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2) and T2DM. The renal key secondary endpoint replicated the primary composite of FIDELIO-DKD. All patients were treated with optimal RAS-blockade and over 95% had hypertension. Patients are randomized to placebo or finerenone (10–20 mg/d). After a median follow-up of 3.4 years finerenone significantly reduced the primary CV-composite endpoint compared to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.98; P = 0.03). The secondary composite outcome (time to onset of kidney failure, sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline or renal death) occurred in 350 patients (9.5%) in the finerenone group and in 395 (10.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.87, 95% CI, 0.76–1.01).

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115r2dVh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — definition, risk, assessment, and therapy thresholds are summarized. CKD is defined as reduced kidney function for at least 3 months duration, with markers including albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) or other markers of kidney damage. CKD and HFpEF often coexist, and CKD is a risk factor for incident HFpEF, with a prevalence of ~50% in individuals with HF, and CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and up to a 3-fold increase in mortality in HFpEF. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides are usually higher in individuals with CKD as compared with those without, making usual cutoffs less specific for the diagnosis of HF. Assessment notes serum creatinine may be falsely reduced due to loss of muscle mass or volume expansion/hemodilution, resulting in a falsely increased eGFR, and other useful markers include the presence of albuminuria, evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increasing creatinine with diuresis as a result of hemoconcentration to identify the true degree of CKD. Collaboration and comanagement by nephrology and cardiology should be considered, and agents that reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2is, and the nonsteroidal, selective MRAs, finerenone; trials have included individuals with eGFRs as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m² for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, 25 mL/min/1.73 m² for finerenone, and 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for SGLT2is. In HFpEF, the PARAGON-HF trial demonstrated less decline in renal function with the ARNI compared with the ARB, and EMPEROR-Preserved also noted less decline in renal function with the SGLT2i empagliflozin vs placebo. Based on these findings, the use of an SGLT2i (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) is beneficial in slowing the decline of kidney function in individuals with HFpEF and CKD above and beyond other therapies, and when using RAAS blockers and/or SGLT2is, monitoring kidney function and serum potassium is useful 1 to 2 weeks after initiation.

### Estimated long-term benefits of finerenone in heart failure: a prespecified secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^112D9kDg]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial, treatment with finerenone was estimated to yield clinically meaningful gains in event-free survival among individuals with HFmrEF or HFpEF. Extension in event-free survival was observed across a broad age range and in patients already treated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Given longer anticipated lifetime therapeutic exposure, long-term gains in event-free survival were especially prominent when finerenone is initiated in younger and middle-aged patients. These data support the role of finerenone in modifying longitudinal risks of clinical events and provide estimates of its long-term expected therapeutic benefits that might be useful to aid clinical decision-making.

When considering initiation of a new medical therapy, patients and clinicians often are interested in the lifetime effects on morbidity and mortality. Yet, clinical trials are conducted over years rather than decades of follow-up due to resource limitations, the need to generate evidence more rapidly to inform practice, and the challenges in maintaining randomization (especially to a placebo comparator). Although real-world evidence may provide ancillary evidence of long-term safety with drug exposure, these data are subject to confounding due to selection bias of those treated in routine care. To address these limitations of existing data sources, we developed a novel age-based method to extrapolate within-trial observations to provide less biased and potentially informative estimates of long-term treatment benefits. In validating this approach in previous trials, estimated event-free survival based on these projections from within-trial follow-up closely aligned with actual event-free survival observed during extended post-trial follow-up. Since initial development and validation, these actuarial methods have been applied to a number of randomized clinical trials to aid in the interpretation of long-term effects of various therapies in HF.

### Finerenone and kidney outcomes in Patients with heart Failure: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^114nWc6W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Finerenone has kidney-protective effects in patients with chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes, but effects on kidney outcomes in patients with heart failure with and without diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease are not known.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of finerenone on kidney outcomes in FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), a randomized trial of finerenone vs placebo among patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Methods

We explored the effects of finerenone on the secondary outcome of a sustained ≥ 50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline or kidney failure (sustained eGFR decline < 15mL/min/1.73m 2; initiation of maintenance dialysis; renal transplantation). In this prespecified analysis, we also report effects of finerenone on: 1) sustained ≥ 57% eGFR decline or kidney failure; 2) eGFR slope; and 3) changes in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR).

Results

Among 6,001 participants, mean baseline eGFR was 62 ± 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2; 48% had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Overall, 5,797 had baseline UACR data (median: 18 mg/g [Q1-Q3: 7–67 mg/g]). Over 2.6 years median follow-up, the incidence of the composite kidney outcome (≥ 50% eGFR decline or kidney failure) was numerically, but nonsignificantly, higher for finerenone vs placebo (75 vs 55 events; HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.94–1.89). Similar results were observed for the composite of ≥ 57% eGFR decline or kidney failure (41 vs 31 events; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.80–2.05), although the overall event frequency was relatively low. During the first 3 months, finerenone led to an acute decline in eGFR of -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (95% CI: -3.4 to -2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2) but did not alter chronic (from 3 months) eGFR slope (+0.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year; 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year), vs placebo. The difference in total slope was -0.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year (95% CI: -0.9 to -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year.). Finerenone reduced UACR by 30% (95% CI: 25%-34%) over 6 months vs placebo, an effect that persisted throughout follow-up. Finerenone reduced the risk of new-onset of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria by 24% (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.68–0.83) and 38% (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.53–0.73), respectively.

Conclusions

In FINEARTS-HF, a population at low risk of adverse kidney outcomes, finerenone did not significantly modify the kidney composite outcomes. Finerenone led to a greater reduction in initial eGFR, but did not result in a significant difference in chronic eGFR slope vs placebo. Finerenone led to early and sustained reductions in albuminuria and reduced the risk of new-onset micro- and macroalbuminuria.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111sLuiP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Two recent prespecified subgroup analyses of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies investigated the efficacy of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2DM with and without heart failure. Patients with symptomatic HFrEF (NYHA II-IV) were excluded in both trials, which means that patients with heart failure at baseline had either asymptomatic HFrEF, HFrEF with NYHA class I, HFmrEF or HFpEF. In the FIDELIO-DKD analysis, 436 (7.7%) of the overall population had a history of heart failure. Over a median-follow-up of 2.6 years, the composite CV outcome of CV-death, non-fatal MI and stroke or hospitalization for heart failure was significantly reduced by finerenone independent of the presence or absence of heart failure (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.50–1.06 and hazard ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.77–1.04, respectively; P = 033). Similar results were reported in the prespecified analysis of FIGARO-DKD, where 571 (7.8%) patients of the overall population had a history of heart failure at baseline. Consistently, the beneficial effects of finerenone on improving heart failure outcomes were not modified by the presence or absence of heart failure. Finerenone also significantly reduced the incidence of new-onset heart failure when compared to placebo. These data show for the first-time favorable actions of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone in a larger population of heart failure patients with CKD and T2DM. Also, regarding the applicability of these data to patients with HFpEF, these results seem very important. The exclusion of patients with HFrEF in FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD increases the likelihood that many of the patients diagnosed in these trials at baseline with heart failure had HFpEF. This is further supported by the baseline characteristics of these patients including more female patients, higher body mass index, and higher C-reactive protein – all signs indicative of HFpEF.

Conclusions

In this prespecified secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial, long-term treatment with finerenone was estimated to extend event-free survival by up to 3 years among people with HFmrEF or HFpEF. The relative benefits reported during follow-up in the FINEARTS-HF trial can be interpreted together with these new projections of the expected absolute benefits with lifetime use of finerenone.

### Mineralocorticoid antagonism in heart Failure: established and emerging therapeutic role [^112F4f1E]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) is related to the overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to fluid retention and adverse myocardial remodeling. Although mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are recommended for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), they remain underused due to adverse effects such as hyperkalemia; and their efficacy is controversial in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Recent trials in people with diabetes and kidney disease have supported the use of nonsteroidal MRAs in reducing HF-related morbidity and mortality and have fewer side effects than their steroidal counterparts. The efficacy and safety of nonsteroidal MRAs have not been tested in HF and are currently being evaluated in additional clinical trials. This review comprehensively examines the current data regarding MRAs for HF and the future direction of nonsteroidal MRA research while exploring the causes of MRA underutilization.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

Although patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) represent nearly half of the population with chronic heart failure, few evidence-based medical therapies are available. The neutral overall results of the TOPCAT trial of spironolactone in HF-PEF leave clinicians who treat heart failure with an ongoing clinical dilemma. In this review, we outline an approach to the clinical management of the patient with HF-PEF synthesizing data from available clinical trials and expert consensus.

### Finerenone in women and men with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction… [^1156HN2F]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Are the effects and safety profile of finerenone in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction consistent in women and men. Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 6001 adults with symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction, women and men experienced similar outcomes from finerenone treatment in reducing cardiovascular death and heart failure events, as well as improving symptoms. Adverse events were more common with finerenone but did not differ between the sexes. Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the risk of the primary end point similarly in women and men: rate ratio 0. 78 in women and
0. 88 in men. Conclusions and Relevance In FINEARTS-HF, finerenone reduced the risk of the primary end point similarly in women and men with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Finerenone had similar tolerability in women and men. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04435626. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death and total HF events, including unplanned hospitalization for HF or urgent HF events. Treatment with finerenone reduced the primary end point significantly by 16% compared with placebo.
20. Consistent benefits were observed for the components of the primary outcome, ie, total HF events HF events and cardiovascular death, while also improving symptoms, in both women and men. Additionally, finerenone had similar tolerability in women and men.

Heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction is relatively more common in women, and results of this study suggest that the consistent efficacy and safety of finerenone is especially relevant for them.

### Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms [^1138wGxM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPHASIS-HF was published by Zannad F and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of eplerenone in patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms? In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the population was: 2737 patients (610 female, 2127 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with NYHA class II HF and an ejection fraction of no more than 35%. The key exclusion criteria were acute myocardial infarction, NYHA class III or IV HF, serum potassium level > 5.0 mmol/L, an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area, or need for a potassium-sparing diuretic. In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the interventions were: n = 1364 eplerenone (up to 50 mg daily plus recommended therapy) n = 1373 placebo (matching placebo plus recommended therapy). In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF (18.3% vs. 25.9%; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.74). In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause (12.5% vs. 15.5%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93) Significant decrease in death due to cardiovascular causes (10.8% vs. 13.5%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.94) Significant decrease in hospitalizations for HF (12% vs. 18.4%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.7). In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in adverse event leading to discontinuation of study drug (13.8% vs. 16.2%, p = 0.09) and hyperkalemia > 5.5 mmol/L (11.8% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001). In the EMPHASIS-HF study, the conclusion was: in patients with NYHA class II HF and an ejection fraction of no more than 35%, eplerenone was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF.

### Finerenone according to frailty in heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^116Sfgw3]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Effects of Finerenone on Clinical Outcomes According to Frailty

There is a common perception that the benefit-risk profile of evidence-based pharmacological therapies may be less favorable in patients with frailty, and clinicians may be more reluctant to initiate, and perhaps even more likely to discontinue, effective therapies in these individuals. However, there is little evidence to support these concerns in patients with HF. Indeed, in 2 trials of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, the favorable effects of sacubitril-valsartan (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEi to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure [PARADIGM-HF])and dapagliflozin (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure [DAPA-HF])were consistent, regardless of the degree of frailty. Similarly, the beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were observed across the range of frailty studied in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF enrolled in the DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, although there was a trend toward a diminished effect in very frail patients in the latter trial (and the opposite trend in the former trial). In 2 other trials of patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF, frailty status did not modify the effects of the steroidal MRA spironolactone (TOPCAT-Americas) or sacubitril-valsartan (PARAGON-HF), although neither trial showed a significant benefit of treatment overall.

In the present analysis of approximately 6000 patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF enrolled in FINEARTS-HF, the efficacy of the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone was not diminished in patients with the greatest degree of frailty. Indeed, there was a trend toward a greater effect of finerenone, compared with placebo, on the primary outcome and total worsening HF events in patients with a greater degree of frailty, a finding consistent with what was observed with sacubitril-valsartan in PARAGON-HF and dapagliflozin in DELIVER. This finding is not surprising, as deterioration in HF and subsequent hospitalization represents one of the most common external stressors in these patients, which in turn may lead to the progression of frailty, thus creating a vicious cycle. Because patients with the greatest degree of frailty were at higher absolute risk, their absolute benefit with treatment was substantially greater. These findings should challenge any clinical reluctance to introduce this new treatment in patients considered to be frail.

These aforementioned results are also in line with further post-hoc analyses of the TOPCAT trial investigating whether MRA therapy may be more effective in specific HFpEF-phenogroups. Data from these studies implicate that spironolactone may have more favorable actions in the metabolic obese and the younger NP deficient phenotype. These results are highly significant for the development of future therapeutic strategies for HFpEF, as they point towards a personalized approach combining deep diagnostic phenomapping and pharmacological decision making, e.g. personalized MRA therapy.

One of the major limitations of the use of steroidal MRA in heart failure therapy is the development of hyperkalemia, specifically in patients with existing RAS inhibiting medication or in the presence of CKD. Thus, a 3.3-fold increased risk for the development of hyperkalemia was detected for spironolactone in the TOPCAT (America) trial. An increased risk for hyperkalemia with MRA was recently confirmed in an individual patient data meta-analysis including 12.700 patients from RALES, EMPHASIS-HF, TOPCAT (Americas), and EPHESUS. The limited benefit-risk profile of steroidal MRA in heart failure therapy led, among other reasons, to the development of non-steroidal MRA, such as finerenone, which so far appear to have a lower risk of hyperkalemia and thus may represent an alternative in heart failure/ HFpEF therapy.

### Finerenone and outpatient worsening heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a… [^114thvFE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Does the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduce outpatient worsening heart failure events requiring oral diuretic intensification among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 6001 participants, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were common and associated with greater risk of subsequent death compared with stable outpatients. Finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensifications by 11%. Meaning Finerenone may prevent outpatient worsening HF in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Importance Worsening heart failure is commonly managed in the outpatient setting with adjustments in oral diuretic therapy.

The effect of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone on outpatient worsening HF events in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction is unknown. The Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure compared the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone with placebo in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction who were using either a loop or thiazide diuretic at baseline. 12–14 Finerenone reduced the primary outcome of total worsening HF events and cardiovascular death by 16%. Finally, our results provide further support that finerenone reduces worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

The primary results of the FINEARTS-HF trial showed that finerenone reduced the prespecified primary outcome of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events by 16%, with a similar reduction in first events. We now show that finerenone also reduced the clinically meaningful outcome of outpatient oral diuretic intensification by 11% and an extended composite including the primary outcome by 15%. These results indicate that the benefits of finerenone extend to reductions in outpatient worsening HF. Finerenone decreased the risk of oral diuretic intensification alone and as part of an extended composite outcome including CV death, HF hospitalizations, and urgent HF visits. Reductions in worsening HF events with finerenone in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction appear to extend to the outpatient setting.

### Effect of finerenone on the KCCQ in Patients with HFmrEF / HFpEF: a Prespecified Analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^112quUfx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) are limited by symptoms and have impaired quality of life. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a patient-reported outcome measure that enables evaluation of the effect of HF and the impact of new therapies on health status in patients with HF.

Objectives

This prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) assessed the efficacy and safety of finerenone according to baseline KCCQ Total Symptom Score (TSS) and the effect of finerenone on KCCQ-TSS.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF tested the efficacy of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone, compared with placebo, in patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction/preserved ejection fraction. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events. The KCCQ was completed by patients at randomization and at 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization. Change in KCCQ-TSS was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were stratified by KCCQ-TSS tertiles at baseline. The association between KCCQ tertile and clinical outcomes was evaluated using semiparametric proportional-rates models for total events and Cox models for time-to-first-event data, and the effects of finerenone vs placebo on the primary endpoint were assessed across tertiles of KCCQ-TSS.

Results

Of the 6,001 participants in FINEARTS-HF, 5,986 (99.8%) had baseline KCCQ-TSS recorded (median score 69.8 of a possible 100; higher score = better health status). Lower (worse) KCCQ-TSS was associated with a higher risk of the primary endpoint. Finerenone, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary endpoint across the range of KCCQ-TSS: tertile 1 (score 0- < 57): RR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–1.00); tertile 2 (57- < 81): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70–1.11); tertile 3 (81–100): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.69–1.14) (P interaction = 0.89). Compared with placebo, finerenone significantly improved KCCQ-TSS from baseline with a mean difference at 12 months of 1.62 points (95% CI: 0.69–2.56 points) (P < 0.001). Numerically fewer finerenone-treated patients experienced clinically meaningful deterioration, and more had improvements in KCCQ-TSS.

Conclusions

Finerenone significantly reduced HF events and improved health status in patients with HF and mildly reduced ejection fraction/preserved ejection fraction across the spectrum of KCCQ-TSS at baseline.

### Finerenone reduces risk of incident heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: analyses from the FIgARO-DKD trial [^1144hk9S]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

With the exclusion of patients with symptomatic HFrEF in FIGARO-DKD (because of the class IA recommendation in guidelines for MRA treatment), the subgroup of patients with HF analyzed in this study are likely those with stage B (asymptomatic HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) or stage C HF (ie, current or previous signs and symptoms of HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction or HFpEF). Indeed, the baseline characteristics of the patients with a history of HF in the present study — more likely female, obese with lower eGFR, and higher C-reactive protein — are more indicative of a HFpEF population. Data on the efficacy and safety of steroidal MRAs in patients with HFpEF are mixed. – Data from the current analyses are limited to allow for any conclusions, but it is the first set of preliminary data evaluating a nonsteroidal MRA in patients with HFpEF or HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction. The ongoing FINEARTS-HF study (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, will offer a robust insight into the effects of finerenone in this patient population. 32

In the present study, finerenone led to a 29% reduction in the risk of first HHF compared with placebo, and furthermore, the rate of total HHF was reduced by 30%. The FIGARO-DKD trial included patients at high cardiovascular risk, with a broader spectrum of patients with CKD, yet overall, less advanced kidney disease than those included in FIDELIO-DKD. – In the FIDELIO-DKD study, a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular outcomes was also observed with finerenone compared with placebo. This was reflected by lower incidence rates for HHF as well as cardiovascular death in the finerenone group; however, the magnitude of risk reduction for HHF was smaller than that observed in the present study, at 14%. In patients with CKD, T2D, and HF, mortality and hospitalization rates have been shown to increase with CKD severity. Therefore, initiating treatment at earlier stages of disease such as those represented in these analyses, 62% of whom had albuminuric CKD with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2, may be more beneficial for this patient population, and may explain in part the larger magnitude of treatment effect observed with finerenone on HF outcomes in the FIGARO-DKD trial.

### Finerenone and atrial fibrillation in heart failure: a secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^112FK5T9]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF), especially in patients with HF and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This arrhythmia often causes hemodynamic deterioration, leading to increases in cardiac filling pressures and natriuretic peptide levels, and is associated with exacerbation of symptoms and worse outcomes. In addition, AF is associated with attenuated efficacy of some therapies, such as β-blockers, in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Whether AF modifies the effect of mineralocorticoid receptor agonist (MRA) therapy in HFmrEF or HFpEF is uncertain. AF in HF is associated with more advanced disease, more extensive adverse remodeling, and greater neurohumoral activation, all of which might also attenuate the potential benefits of MRA therapy. Additionally, patients with AF usually have worse kidney function, which may make them more susceptible to the adverse effects of MRAs on kidney outcomes and potassium level. Moreover, spironolactone was not superior to placebo in the Improved Exercise Tolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction by Spironolactone on Myocardial Fibrosis in Atrial Fibrillation (IMPRESS-AF) trial, a dedicated trial in patients with HFpEF and AF. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments according to AF status in patients with HF. Antialdosterone therapies are also of specific interest in relation to AF because aldosterone may play a role in electrical and structural atrial remodeling and contribute to the development of AF. This has led to the hypothesis that MRA therapy might reduce the incidence of new-onset AF in patients with HF.,

In this prespecified subgroup analysis of the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) randomized clinical trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone, compared with placebo, according to baseline AF status in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF. Furthermore, we examined the effect of finerenone on the incidence of new-onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL), which was a prespecified exploratory end point in the FINEARTS-HF trial.

### Estimated long-term benefits of finerenone in heart failure: a prespecified secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^112dsbGm]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF Trial Design

The design of the FINEARTS-HF trial has been previously described in detail (Supplement 1 and Supplement 2). In brief, the FINEARTS-HF trial was a global event-driven, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial examining finerenone in patients with HF and a left ventricular EF of 40% or greater. Key inclusion criteria included age of 40 years or older, New York Heart Association functional class II or greater symptoms, elevated natriuretic peptide levels, evidence of structural heart disease, and recent diuretic use. Key laboratory-based exclusion criteria included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 or serum potassium level greater than 5.0 mmol/L (to convert to milliequivalents per liter, divide by 1). Additional relevant exclusion criteria included probable alternative causes to presenting symptoms other than HF, severe valvular heart disease requiring surgery, life-threatening or uncontrolled arrhythmia, or any condition limiting life expectancy to less than 12 months (such as active malignancy). Enrollment was permitted across major clinical care settings (whether hospitalized, recently hospitalized, or ambulatory). Patients self-identified with the following races and ethnicities: Asian, Black, White, and other, which included American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, or unreported. All patients provided written informed consent for participation, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards or ethics committees at all sites. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines.

Randomization, Target Dosing, and End Points

Participants were randomized 1:1 to finerenone (which could be titrated to 20 mg if starting eGFR was ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 or to 40 mg if starting eGFR was > 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) or matching placebo. The primary end point was cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events (inclusive of both hospitalizations and urgent ambulatory visits for HF). All-cause mortality was a secondary end point. In applying these actuarial methods, we considered survival time free from the first occurrence of the primary end point. All potential primary end points and deaths were adjudicated by a clinical end points committee.

### Breakthroughs in the treatment of heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^116PSmWj]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Historically, only patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than or equal to 40% were considered to have heart failure (HF). However, it was later found that patients could have elevated cardiac filling pressures and the stigmata of HF signs and symptoms with normal LVEF. This subset of patients has undergone multiple taxonomical variations and is now termed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with the lower limit of LVEF assigned as roughly ≥ 40%-50% in clinical trials and ≥ 50% in HF guidelines. Patients with LVEF 41%-49% did not clearly fit these designations but bear resemblance to both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HFpEF. This cohort was initially assigned the term HFpEF (borderline), which has also undergone several modifications and is currently termed heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). Earlier landmark HF trials were heavily focused on patients with HFrEF. Only in the last 2 decades has there been an increasing focus on HFpEF with emergence of key drug therapies including sodium-glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors that have shown to improve outcomes across the whole LVEF spectrum. There is yet to be a focused clinical trial to determine therapeutic modalities for HFmrEF; most of the evidence has been extrapolated from subgroup analysis mostly from HFpEF trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the historical basis of HFpEF and HFmrEF and discuss key therapeutic advances in their management.

### Combined endurance and resistance exercise training in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a randomized controlled trial [^115MwzMp]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health burden, with approximately 6.7 million individuals affected in the United States between 2017 and 2020. At least half of patients with HF have preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and the prognosis is similar to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, in contrast to numerous guideline-recommended pharmacological and non-pharmacological management options in HFrEF, only sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor antagonist semaglutide and the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone have so far improved clinical outcomes in HFpEF –. A hallmark clinical feature of HFpEF is reduced exercise tolerance, measured as decreased peak oxygen consumption (VO 2) assessed during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), secondary to impaired cardiac, vascular and skeletal muscle function. Exercise training (ET) is an effective therapy to improve peakin clinically stable patients with HFpEF. However, most studies have been short term (≤ 6 months) or limited to endurance training, and prolonged endurance training (moderate continuous or high-intensity interval training) performed over 12 months failed to result in significant improvements in peak(ref.). Combining endurance and resistance training (with or without additional caloric restriction) has been observed to significantly improve peakby 2.4–3.3 mL kg −1 min −1 over 12–20 weeks in individuals with HFpEF (including our Exercise training in Diastolic Heart Failure (Ex-DHF) pilot trial); however, long-term effects remain unknown. Moreover, because HFpEF is a systemic, multi-organ syndrome with diverse pathophysiological and clinical presentation, clinical parameters, such as HF symptoms, peak, left ventricular function, health-related quality of life or morbidity in isolation, may not satisfactorily reflect the overall disease state. Therefore, Packer proposed combining symptom severity outcomes and clinical events in a hierarchical, three-level ordinal score to evaluate the efficacy of HF therapies. Based on the results of the Ex-DHF pilot trial, we followed this approach and modified the Packer score for patients with HFpEFto evaluate whether 12 months of supervised endurance and resistance ET will be superior to usual care (UC). This paper focuses on the primary endpoint, on safety outcomes and on secondary endpoints related to the components of the primary endpoint.

### Reappraisal on pharmacological and mechanical treatments of heart failure [^114dUEpz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

MRAs decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with HF. But the current source of evidence is mainly eplerenone and finerenone for HFrEF, and mainly spironolactone for HFpEF, which might help clinicians in their treatment decisions. The improved LV function observed in those trials is contradictory, and further investigation in larger populations is required. For the uncertainty of spironolactone in the treatment of AHF, EARLIER may give us more inspiration. Additional comparative studies are also required to comprehensively characterize the clinical relevance of the pharmacological differences between MRAs.

### Finerenone in patients with a recent worsening heart failure event: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^117MKfQ3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) and a recent worsening heart failure (WHF) event are known to be at high risk of recurrent hospitalization and death, regardless of ejection fraction.

Objectives

This study examined the efficacy and safety of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone in relation to the recency of a WHF event.

Methods

FINEARTS-HF (FINerenone trial to investigate Efficacy and sAfety superioR to placebo in paTientS with Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of finerenone in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%. In this prespecified analysis, we assessed the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and response to finerenone vs placebo in relation to the time from WHF to randomization (during or within 7 days, 7 days to 3 months, > 3 months, or no prior WHF). The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) WHF events and CV death, analyzed using a proportional rates method.

Results

Of 6,001 patients validly randomized to finerenone or placebo, 1,219 (20.3%) were enrolled during (749 [12.5%]) or within 7 days (470 [7.8%]), 2,028 (33.8%) between 7 days and 3 months, and 937 (15.6%) > 3 months from a WHF event; 1,817 (30.3%) had no prior history of WHF. Rates of the primary composite outcome varied inversely with time since WHF, with > 2-fold higher risk in those enrolled during or within 7 days of WHF compared with those enrolled > 3 months from WHF or without prior WHF (risk ratio [RR]: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.82–2.55). Compared to placebo, finerenone appeared to lower the risk of the primary composite to a greater extent in those enrolled within 7 days of WHF (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57–0.95) or between 7 days and 3 months of WHF (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.97) than in those > 3 months from WHF or without prior WHF (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.81–1.21); however, no definitive treatment-by-time interaction could be confirmed (P = 0.07). Greater absolute risk reductions with finerenone were accordingly seen in those with recent WHF (P trend = 0.011). The risk of adverse events including hyperkalemia and worsening renal function among patients assigned to finerenone was not increased in those with recent WHF.

Conclusions

Compared with those without recent WHF, patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction who have experienced a recent WHF event are at higher risk for recurrent HF events and CV death; a possible signal of enhanced absolute treatment benefit with finerenone in this population requires further confirmation in future studies.

### When to use spironolactone, eplerenone or finerenone in the spectrum of cardiorenal diseases [^112VYsL6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease frequently coexists with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, and this dual presence significantly amplifies the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and common CV risk factors contribute to the increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors, which in turn can drive the progression of chronic CV-kidney disorders. The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient outcomes in cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or after a myocardial infarction, but have limited value in patients with chronic kidney disease. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has now established itself as a foundational guideline-recommended therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. To date, these pharmacological agents have been developed in distinct patient populations. The consequences of their distinct pharmacological profiles necessitate further consideration. They have not undergone testing across the entire spectrum of cardiorenal scenarios, and the evidence base is currently being complemented with ongoing trials. In this review, we aim to synthesize the existing body of evidence and chart the future trajectory for the use of spironolactone, eplerenone and finerenone in improving clinical outcomes across the diverse spectrum of cardiorenal diseases. By consolidating the current state of knowledge, we seek to provide valuable insights for informed decision making in the management of patients with these complex and interconnected conditions.

Table 1
Key heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction randomized trials targeting the aldosterone–mineralocorticoid receptor pathway as of 2024

Thus, based on the mechanisms involved in HFpEF, the fact that MRAs target these mechanisms, their proven efficacy in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and the suggestive but inconclusive findings in TOPCAT post‐hoc analyses, there is a need for an outcome trial of MRAs in HFpEF and also in HFmrEF. Therefore, the first objective of Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is to assess whether the initiation of spironolactone or eplerenone plus standard care compared to standard care alone improves outcomes in patients with HFpEF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs): Spironolactone showed heterogeneity by region, with benefit in North America (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69–0.98) and no benefit in Russia/Georgia (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.79–1.51), and evidence demonstrated undetectable canrenone in a larger proportion in Russia than the United States and Canada (30% vs 3%; P < 0.001), confirming regional variation in reported versus actual use; within the TOPCAT trial, benefit was most evident in the lower tertile of natriuretic peptides — B-type natriuretic peptide < 166 pg/mL and NT-proBNP < 682 pg/mL — among those with an LVEF < 60% and in women, with reductions in events similar across LVEF strata, and although MRAs have not improved quality of life or exercise tolerance, most individuals with HFpEF will still benefit from MRAs to provide balanced diuresis, control hypertension, and reduce HF hospitalizations.

### Finerenone and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^112me4oK]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous evidence for the role of MRAs in non–heart failure populations is limited. This is the first study to demonstrate that finerenone, a novel, nonsteroidal, selective MRA can reduce risk of CVD in a population with CKD where patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were excluded, with only a minority of patients having a history of heart failure at baseline (7.7% of all patients). Meta-analysis of patient-level data from 2 trials with the steroidal MRAs spironolactone and eplerenone demonstrated a trend for a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death in a secondary prevention setting, in a predominantly nonheart failure patient population with low-risk ST-segment–elevation MI. Preclinical data indicate greater cardiovascular protection with finerenone than the steroidal MRA eplerenone, associated with more potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects; data from our study expand on this evidence to include clinical data demonstrating primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention with finerenone.

### Finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with and without heart failure: a prespecified subgroup analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD trial [^113HEwfH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) often coexist, with each condition increasing the incidence and worsening the prognosis of the others.CKD and T2D are highly prevalent among patients with HF, being present in up to 50% of patients enrolled in modern HF trials. The prognosis of patients with HF, CKD, and T2D is unfavourable and further studies are needed to improve their outcomes.

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), including spironolactone and the more selective and less potent eplerenone, improve prognosis in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and have a class IA recommendation in European and US guidelines for the treatment of these patients. Mechanistic studies have suggested that MRAs may further improve left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, but a clear benefit in outcomes has not been demonstrated in HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in randomized trials.

Finerenone, a novel, selective, non‐steroidal MRA, demonstrated clinically meaningful effects on improving kidney outcomes and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD and T2D without HFrEF in the Finerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO‐DKD) trial. Phase II studies have demonstrated promising results with finerenone in patients with HFrEF, with T2D and/or CKD. The aim of this prespecified analysis of the FIDELIO‐DKD trial is to examine the effects of finerenone on cardiovascular, kidney and HF outcomes in patients with and without a history of HF (HFpEF or HFmrEF) at baseline (Graphical Abstract).

### Evidentiary landscape of heart failure therapies, regulatory decisions, and translation into guidelines [^111HXRQx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the last decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 6 drugs to reduce morbidity or mortality and improve functional capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 3 drugs to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Of the drugs approved for HFrEF, only 2 reduced mortality (sacubitril/valsartan in the PARADIGM-HF trial and dapagliflozin in the DAPA-HF trial). None of the drugs approved for HFpEF reduced mortality. Four trials, 1 with finerenone (FINEARTS-HF trial), 2 with semaglutide (STEP-HFpEF/DM trial), and 1 with tirzepatide (SUMMIT trial) met their primary endpoint in patients with HFpEF and are currently under review for approval. In contrast, before 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 11 drugs (captopril, enalapril, valsartan, candesartan, long-acting metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine, spironolactone, and epleronone) for patients with chronic stable HFrEF but none for HFpEF. All 11 drugs reduced mortality and morbidity except for digoxin, which only reduced hospitalization for heart failure. This state-of-the-art review examines the evidentiary support for regulatory actions and incorporation into guidelines of heart therapies approved since 2015.

FINEARTS-HF Study Design

The study design, baseline characteristics, and primary resultsof FINEARTS-HF have been published previously. In brief, FINEARTS-HF was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of finerenone in adults ≥ 40 years of age with symptomatic HFmrEF or HFpEF conducted across 37 countries. Key inclusion criteria included left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%, elevated natriuretic peptide levels (thresholds adjusted for atrial fibrillation status at screening and recency of worsening HF event), evidence of structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy), and recent diuretic use for at least the previous 30 days. Key exclusion criteria included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 mL·min·1.73 m 2 or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L. Patients were enrolled irrespective of clinical care setting (whether hospitalized, recently hospitalized, or ambulatory). All participants provided explicit informed consent and the study protocol was approved at local institutional review boards or ethics committees at all participating sites.

Participants were randomized 1:1 to finerenone (versus matching placebo) with target dosing on the basis of baseline eGFR (20 mg if baseline eGFR was ≤ 60 mL·min·1.73 m² or 40 mg once daily if baseline eGFR was > 60 mL·min·1.73 m²) in addition to usual therapy. Study investigators were encouraged to treat patients with other medications according to local recommendations, except for MRAs, which were prohibited during the trial.

### Finerenone and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^113JpYpu]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality increases with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and is further exacerbated by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Approximately 40% of patients with diabetes have CKD, which exposes them to a 3-fold higher risk of cardiovascular death versus those with T2D alone. Both albuminuria and a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Even with mildly increased albuminuria, cardiovascular risk is increased, and as eGFR decreases to below 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2, the risk of heart failure doubles, and the probability of developing atherosclerotic CVD increases linearly. Atherosclerotic CVD in patients with CKD and T2D is driven by a combination of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, metabolic factors, hypertension, and history of previous cardiovascular events) and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress), with the latter having a greater role as eGFR declines. Strategies to protect the kidneys of patients with CKD and T2D may mitigate their risk of cardiovascular events.

In preclinical models, overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk by driving inflammation and fibrosis, leading to damage to the heart, kidney, and peripheral vasculature. – Elevated aldosterone can contribute to a variety of conditions including CKD, heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke, and primary aldosteronism is prevalent in patients with resistant hypertension. Increased aldosterone levels can lead to MR overactivation in patients at risk of CKD progression or CVD; other possible mechanisms in this population include increased MR expression, cortisol-mediated MR activation, and ligand-independent MR activation (eg, caused by oxidative stress). – Finerenone is a novel, nonsteroidal, selective MR antagonist (MRA), which, in an exploratory analysis of a phase IIb trial of patients with worsening chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and T2D and/or CKD, was associated with a reduction in the incidence of a composite end point of all-cause mortality and heart failure outcomes in comparison with the steroidal MRA eplerenone. In the phase III FIDELIO-DKD study (Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease), finerenone significantly reduced the risk of kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and T2D. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the effect of finerenone on cardiovascular and kidney failure outcomes in patients with CKD and T2D, including in those with and without a history of CVD.
