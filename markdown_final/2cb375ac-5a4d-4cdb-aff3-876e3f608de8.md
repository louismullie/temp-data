## Question

Management of antibiotic allergy in SWAB guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of antibiotic allergy according to the SWAB guideline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline's scope and overarching principles. Then, I should verify the initial assessment framework and risk stratification. Next, I will examine cross-reactivity and side-chain logic for β-lactams. After that, I need to check the delabeling strategies, including direct oral challenges and when to use skin testing. I will then review special populations and high-risk phenotypes, integrate antimicrobial stewardship implications, and finally synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with documentation and follow-up recommendations, making sure I reconcile any discrepancies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the guideline's scope and principles. The SWAB guideline addresses suspected allergy to β-lactam and non–β-lactam antibiotics and explicitly adopts a more liberal, stewardship-aligned approach that balances benefits of first-line β-lactams against the true risk of serious allergy, emphasizing that most reported "allergies" are not true immunologic hypersensitivity and that cross-reactivity within β-lactams is largely side-chain driven rather than due to the β-lactam core, which supports selective re-exposure when side chains are dissimilar and the phenotype is low risk [^1136ZUSJ].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment framework before moving on. A detailed, critical allergy history is mandatory and should characterize timing, morphology, severity, and temporal relation to infection, because many labels reflect intolerance or viral exanthems. SWAB aligns with broader guidance that history-based risk stratification is the cornerstone and that patients with histories inconsistent with allergy (for example, nausea, headache, family history only) can often be delabeled by history alone without testing, which I should keep in mind to avoid unnecessary workups [^1136ZUSJ] [^117RcH4t] [^1167DorV].

> Hold on, I should verify the cross-reactivity logic for β-lactams. SWAB emphasizes that cross-allergy between β-lactam groups is primarily determined by side-chain similarity rather than the β-lactam ring, so when side chains are dissimilar, safe use of an alternative β-lactam is expected. This side-chain principle is consistent with contemporary allergy parameters and helps explain why cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains are generally safe after non-anaphylactic penicillin reactions, though I need to remember that some cross-reactivity tables conflict and that harmonization remains a recognized gap in the literature [^1136ZUSJ] [^1178UoNA] [^1169k4Yf].

> I will now examine delabeling strategies, but let me first confirm when a direct oral challenge is appropriate. For low-risk phenotypes — typically remote, non-anaphylactic cutaneous reactions — SWAB supports direct amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing, a stance echoed by AAAAI 2022 and the CDC, with the caveat that challenges should be standardized, observed, and equipped for anaphylaxis management; I initially thought this might contradict BSACI 2015, but wait, BSACI does support challenge-first approaches in selected low-risk patients and acknowledges that skin testing can be bypassed in specific contexts, so there is no true contradiction once risk is properly stratified [^114DyPSt] [^1167DorV] [^114ew5K4].

> Next, I should review when penicillin skin testing is indicated. Skin testing is recommended for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or recent suspected IgE-mediated reactions, with a negative predictive value around 97–99%, after which a supervised oral challenge with the culprit β-lactam is advised. I need to ensure I document the test determinants used and follow through with challenge, because a negative skin test alone is insufficient to confirm tolerance without a drug challenge [^1167fAAy] [^115Gz6jP] [^1137JD8s].

> But wait, what about special populations and high-risk phenotypes. For severe delayed-type reactions such as SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, or organ injury, SWAB advises against re-exposure and recommends multidisciplinary consultation; this is reinforced by CDC guidance and practice parameters, and I should double-check that I am not inadvertently suggesting challenge in these cases, as that would be unsafe [^1136ZUSJ] [^1167DorV] [^1178UoNA].

> I need to ensure pediatric considerations are addressed. SWAB's adult-centric framework dovetails with pediatric guidance allowing direct amoxicillin challenge in low-risk children with benign cutaneous histories, with the recognition that most pediatric labels are inaccurate and that delabeling restores access to narrow-spectrum β-lactams. Let me reconsider any impulse to default to macrolides in children, as that often overextends spectrum unnecessarily when delabeling is feasible [^114DyPSt] [^115RugcP].

> Let me think about pregnancy and peripartum prophylaxis, since this is a common clinical pressure point. Aligning with obstetric guidance, patients labeled penicillin-allergic should ideally undergo evaluation and delabeling when feasible, with cefazolin preferred for GBS prophylaxis in minor allergies and clindamycin or vancomycin reserved for high-risk phenotypes; I should confirm organism susceptibilities and plan desensitization if penicillin is absolutely required and alternatives are unsuitable [^111imdin] [^1137wVfq].

> Next, I should review the stewardship rationale to ensure the clinical framing is consistent. Reported β-lactam allergy labels drive broad-spectrum alternative use, higher costs, longer length of stay, and more C. difficile and resistant infections; SWAB's liberal approach is designed to counteract these harms by enabling safe first-line β-lactam use in most patients, a strategy repeatedly endorsed by IDSA/SHEA stewardship guidance and supported by outcomes studies showing improved β-lactam utilization after delabeling interventions [^115Gz6jP] [^1153SEnk] [^113z7Rmo].

> I should double-check implementation details. Hospitals benefit from integrated β-lactam allergy pathways embedded within ASPs, with history-based risk stratification, selective skin testing, and direct challenges to increase first-line prescribing; I need to ensure protocols include documentation, provider education, and IT prompts, and that results are communicated clearly to patients and clinicians to sustain delabeling benefits [^1113P29T] [^115cap7g] [^114cLGfu].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure I haven't missed anything. Start with a careful allergy history to classify risk. For low-risk histories, proceed to a supervised direct amoxicillin challenge and, if tolerated, remove the label and restore standard β-lactam use. For high-risk histories or recent IgE-mediated reactions, perform penicillin skin testing with major and minor determinants, followed by an observed oral challenge if negative. For severe delayed hypersensitivity, avoid re-exposure and consult allergy. When choosing alternative β-lactams, use side-chain dissimilarity to guide safe selection, recognizing that cephalosporins and carbapenems can often be used safely depending on phenotype and testing results. Throughout, align choices with local antibiograms and stewardship priorities to minimize collateral harm [^1136ZUSJ] [^1137JD8s] [^112W47Ct].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and follow-up requirements. Record reaction phenotype, risk stratification, testing performed, and outcomes. Provide the patient with a letter and update the medical record and pharmacy systems. Consider re-evaluation only if new reactions occur or if high-risk phenotypes later arise, keeping in mind that resensitization after negative evaluation is uncommon but possible in select cases, particularly after parenteral therapy, which justifies periodic reassessment when risk profiles change [^114cLGfu] [^111J8725].

---

The SWAB guideline recommends a **structured, risk-based approach** to suspected antibiotic allergy, emphasizing detailed history to stratify risk and avoid unnecessary avoidance of first-line β-lactams [^1136ZUSJ]. For low-risk patients, **direct oral challenge** (often with amoxicillin) without prior skin testing is safe and effective for delabeling [^1178UoNA]. For high-risk histories (e.g. anaphylaxis, severe delayed reactions), **refer to allergy specialists** and avoid re-exposure to the culprit drug. Cross-reactivity within β-lactams is low and guided by side-chain similarity; avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist due to toxicity and resistance risk. Always document outcomes and communicate results to support stewardship and future care [^114YcZys].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

A thorough allergy history is **essential** to classify reactions by phenotype and risk [^1167DorV]:

- **Immediate reactions**: Occurring within 1 hour (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) [^notfound].
- **Non-immediate reactions**: Occurring after 1 hour (e.g. maculopapular rash, DRESS, SJS/TEN) [^1167DorV].
- **Non-allergic reactions**: Gastrointestinal upset, headache, or other non-immune symptoms [^1136cv2U].

Risk stratification guides testing and treatment: **low-risk patients** have benign cutaneous reactions, remote reactions (> 5 years), or vague histories, whereas **high-risk patients** have anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), or organ involvement [^1167fAAy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Skin testing

Skin testing is **indicated for high-risk patients** or when a detailed history is unavailable; it has a high negative predictive value (> 95%) for immediate hypersensitivity [^111J8725]. For penicillin allergy, test with major and minor determinants (penicilloyl-polylysine, penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate) [^1137JD8s]. Cephalosporin testing is individualized based on the specific agent and reaction history [^116rsbPd].

---

### Direct oral challenge

Direct oral challenge is **recommended for low-risk patients without prior skin testing** — particularly in children with benign cutaneous reactions [^114DyPSt] — and is safe, efficient, and cost-effective for delabeling [^116qq5ha]. A single observed dose is sufficient in most cases; multiple-day challenges are generally unnecessary [^111TYrVt].

---

### Drug provocation testing (DPT)

Drug provocation testing is the **diagnostic gold standard** when skin testing is negative or unavailable and should be performed in a monitored setting with resuscitation equipment on hand [^111J8725] [^1167DorV]. It is particularly useful for non-immediate reactions and for confirming tolerance after negative skin testing [^114DyPSt] [^111TYrVt].

---

## Management strategies

### β-lactam allergy management

- **Cross-reactivity**: Low between penicillins and cephalosporins/carbas, largely determined by side-chain similarity [^1136ZUSJ].
- **Safe alternatives**: Cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains are generally safe after penicillin allergy; avoid similar side chains in severe reactions [^113N7hpJ].
- **Carbapenems**: Very low cross-reactivity (< 1%); safe after negative penicillin skin testing or graded challenge [^112W47Ct].

---

### Non-β-lactam antibiotic allergies

- **Macrolides**: Safe alternative; low cross-reactivity with β-lactams [^112oRUTg].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for limited use due to toxicity and resistance risk [^116eNbdb].
- **Clindamycin**: Useful for severe β-lactam allergy, especially in surgical prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric patients

Direct oral challenge without prior skin testing is recommended for low-risk pediatric patients, as most can safely receive amoxicillin after evaluation [^114DyPSt]. Delabeling improves access to **first-line β-lactams** and reduces adverse outcomes [^117DebbU].

---

### Pregnant patients

Delabeling enables use of **first-line β-lactams** for GBS prophylaxis and other infections, improving maternal and neonatal outcomes [^111imdin]. Cefazolin is preferred for GBS prophylaxis in patients with low-risk penicillin allergy histories [^1137wVfq].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

Careful risk assessment and specialist input are essential; delabeling facilitates timely, appropriate therapy and improves outcomes [^116JDHPU].

---

## Documentation and communication

Clear documentation of allergy evaluation, testing, and outcomes is **essential** for continuity of care and antibiotic stewardship [^114cLGfu]. Patients should receive written results and counseling to support adherence and future care.

---

## Impact on antibiotic stewardship

Antibiotic allergy labels drive use of broader-spectrum, less effective alternatives, increasing costs, adverse events, and resistance [^115CPhAi]. Delabeling enables **first-line β-lactam use**, improves outcomes, and reduces resistance [^1153SEnk].

---

## Summary of SWAB recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk β-lactam allergy | Direct oral challenge (amoxicillin) [^1178UoNA] |
| High-risk β-lactam allergy | Skin testing → DPT or specialist referral [^1167fAAy] |
| Penicillin allergy needing alternative | Cephalosporin with dissimilar side chain [^1136ZUSJ] |
| Severe delayed reaction | Avoid culprit drug; specialist referral [^1167DorV] |
| Pediatric patients | Direct oral challenge without skin testing [^114DyPSt] |
| Pregnant patients | Delabeling to enable first-line β-lactam use [^111imdin] |

---

The SWAB guideline supports a **risk-based, stewardship-aligned approach** to suspected antibiotic allergy, using history to stratify risk, direct challenges for low-risk patients, and specialist referral for high-risk cases. This strategy expands access to first-line β-lactams, improves outcomes, and reduces resistance.

American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) position statement — low-risk penicillin allergy delabeling — states that since the last AAAAI penicillin allergy position statement, direct oral challenge without preceding skin testing has been recommended as the preferred approach in low-risk pediatric patients and as a consideration in low-risk adult patients, and defines low risk patients as those with a remote history (> 5 years) of cutaneous-only reactions such as itching or morbilliform drug eruptions (MDE). Delabeling penicillin allergy is an important component of antibiotic stewardship and is endorsed by many professional organizations and public health bodies, and a penicillin allergy evaluation is not necessary for patients with a family history of penicillin allergy only or a side effect such as headache or nausea; these patients may simply be delabeled by history alone.

Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy

Penicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial role in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all clinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during pregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is recommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site infections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone regimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients who report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam antimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low.

Prevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately 10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital inpatients and residents in health care–related facilities. One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy. Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication. The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies.

Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-site infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage (,–).

The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term "allergy" by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive.

### Diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in the primary care setting [^116Gwx1k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute otitis media (AOM), and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) account for approximately 75% of antibiotic prescriptions written and are among the leading reasons for physician office visits in the United States. Resistance of the predominant pathogens in respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) to available antibiotics has led clinicians to reevaluate the diagnosis and management of these infections.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide primary care practitioners with an accessible combined resource for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS.

Methods

This review was based on discussions from a roundtable meeting (sponsored by an educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline) that convened clinicians versed in the management of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, primary articles were identified by a MEDLINE search and through secondary sources.

Results

To reduce the prevalence of resistance, judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics must be implemented in clinical practice. With accurate diagnosis of bacterial and nonbacterial conditions, and patient education on antibiotic use and misuse, the excessive use of antibiotics and ensuing resistance can be reduced. The incorporation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with minimum inhibitory concentration values can provide a more comprehensive assessment of antibiotic activity in vivo. Stratification of patients with AECB according to patient characteristics and frequency of exacerbation can be used to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic treatment and to guide clinicians in their choice of antibiotic. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group has issued recommendations on the management of AOM based on prior antibiotic therapy, which is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of ABRS in adults and children are based on the predicted efficacy of various antibiotics as well as patient age, severity of disease, likelihood of bacterial infection, likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and in vitro susceptibility of the predominant pathogens based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakpoints.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS emphasize the importance of differentiating between bacterial and nonbacterial infections, choosing an antibiotic based on the likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens, and providing coverage against the predominant pathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics also has been identified as an instrumental part of controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and subsequent resistance.

### Ethics of antibiotic allergy [^1157AhUJ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Policy recommendations

Given the above analysis, we recommend changes to medical education, clinical practice, clinical guidelines and research. Physicians and other healthcare workers should be educated regarding the low veracity of antibiotic allergy labels and the harmful consequences of using second-line therapy and be encouraged to discuss these considerations with patients in the context of antibiotic prescribing decisions. Physicians should also be educated about cognitive biases and ethical reasoning, including reasons to avoid giving undue weight to avoiding a rare risk of serious allergy (eg, where this would involve foregoing much greater expected benefits and/or causing other harms).

Clinical practice guidelines should also change. Rather than the absolute avoidance of prescribing antibiotics to which a patient is thought to be allergic, guidelines should recommend that physicians weigh benefits and risks appropriately, including by being aware of the rarity of true serious allergy. As a result, practice should change: where appropriate, which is likely to be in the majority of cases, first-line antibiotics should be prescribed to most of the 10%–25% of patients who report an allergy to such drugs. Where available, referral for antibiotic allergy testing should be routine for all patients with allergy labels.

Finally, certain types of clinical research should be prioritised. Clinical trials of antibiotic options for common conditions should include patients with allergy where appropriate. There is also a need for rigorous published data on the allergic and non-allergic ADR risks associated with the use of all commonly prescribed antibiotics. Making physicians aware of the harms associated with first-line and second-line antibiotics (ideally framed in clinically useful terms such as the number needed to harm), and including these data in guidelines, will help physicians make ethically appropriate evidence-based risk-benefit assessments in clinical practice.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111J8725]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin immediate hypersensitivity — skin testing, challenge, and retesting: The negative predictive value for penicillin skin testing is reported as greater than 95% in North American studies, and drug challenge is described as the diagnostic criterion standard recommended after allergy evaluation when the patient is deemed unlikely to be allergic to the given drug. After a negative penicillin skin test result, amoxicillin is typically used for drug challenge, often as a single full dose, or as 1/10th of the final dose followed by the final dose. Resensitization after re‑treatment is noted as uncommon but can develop in up to 20% of patients; repeat skin testing may be considered for patients with severe immediate reactions, especially after parenteral administration, even when a prior therapeutic course has been tolerated. Most patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have negative skin testing and challenge may subsequently receive penicillins without a significantly increased risk compared with the general population, and a retrospective series of 32 patients with negative skin testing reported that repeated intravenous penicillin administration appears safe.

### Penicillin allergy testing and delabeling for patients who are prescribed penicillin: a systematic review for a World Health Organization guideline [^115GobMm]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

People who self-report as penicillin allergic based on unspecific reactions in the past, and in the absence of confirmatory testing, frequently do not have a true penicillin allergy. Removing incorrect penicillin allergy labels (i.e. penicillin allergy delabeling) is of importance to improve antimicrobial stewardship practices worldwide. Delabeling can be done through oral administration of a low-dose penicillin in low-risk penicillin allergy patients, and, on some occasions, may be done directly by clinical history taking alone. The latter approach can also be followed in e-consults, obliviating the need for any further workup, namely when the reported reactions are clearly nonimmunologic (e.g. nausea, headache, or fatigue).

We aimed to assess the role for (i) routine penicillin allergy testing and the (ii) safety of penicillin allergy delabeling approaches in individuals prescribed with penicillin or with a suspected or reported penicillin allergy.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^111vEQiT]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Using non‐beta‐lactam antibiotics where beta‐lactam antibiotics would suffice has several disadvantages such as higher costs, infection‐treatment failure, prolonged treatment and higher readmittance rates. Furthermore, many publications suggest more post‐operative infections and there is overwhelming evidence that it leads to antimicrobial resistance. Up to now, however, most clinicians find it safer and easier to deviate to second‐line treatment in case of a beta‐lactam allergy, whereas it would be preferable to use an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic instead.

Although multiple sources have published tables with information regarding cross‐reactivity and safe alternatives within the group of beta‐lactam antibiotics, the disadvantage of these tables is that they are not readily available and identifying a suitable alternative is time‐consuming, especially if patients are allegedly allergic to more than one beta‐lactam antibiotic. A digital tool to choose an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic could be of added value by preventing unnecessary use of second‐ or third‐line antibiotics.

The general presumption is that the various tables of cross‐reactivity are interchangeable when it comes to safe alternatives, potential risks and high‐risk alternatives. However, in this article, we show that the three most used tables worldwide as well as the recently published Dutch guideline on management in antibiotic allergy not only have internal discrepancies, but the authors also disagree on both safe alternatives in case of (suspected) beta‐lactam allergy and the cause of cross‐reactivity. These discrepancies might lead to hampered clinical outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^114jyP4Z]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — intermittent pouchitis after ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA): In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who have undergone IPAA and experience infrequent episodes of pouchitis, the AGA suggests using antibiotics for treatment of pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Based on available evidence, ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole are the preferred antibiotics, the typical duration of antibiotic therapy is 2–4 weeks, a combination of antibiotics may be more effective in patients who do not respond to single-antibiotic therapy, and alternative antibiotic regimens, such as oral vancomycin, may be considered in patients who do not respond to the initial course of antibiotics or have allergies or intolerance to ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole. Evidence included 4 small RCTs evaluating antibiotics for treatment of pouchitis, of which 2 were placebo-controlled; in these 2 trials, 11 of 19 antibiotic-treated patients vs 3 of 21 placebo-treated patients had clinical improvement (RR, 3.45; 95% CI, 0.29–41.82). On pooled analysis from RCT arms and observational studies, 160 of 239 patients treated with antibiotics had marked improvement in symptoms (pooled response, 65%; 95% CI, 52–75). With assumed spontaneous improvement rates of 40% (range, 30%-50%), antibiotics were associated with 67% higher risk of clinical response (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.34–2.01), and the overall body of evidence from these observational studies led to overall very low certainty of evidence.

### Taking a rational approach to a reported antibiotic allergy [^115RugcP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

### Management of a surgical patient with a label of penicillin allergy: narrative review and consensus recommendations [^1133xNNw]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Unsubstantiated penicillin-allergy labels are common in surgical patients, and can lead to significant harm through avoidance of best first-line prophylaxis of surgical site infections and increased infection with resistant bacterial strains. Up to 98% of penicillin-allergy labels are incorrect when tested. Because of the scarcity of trained allergists in all healthcare systems, only a minority of surgical patients have the opportunity to undergo testing and de-labelling before surgery. Testing pathways can be modified and shortened in selected patients. A variety of healthcare professionals can, with appropriate training and in collaboration with allergists, provide testing for selected patients. We review how patients might be assessed, the appropriate testing strategies that can be used, and the minimum standards of safe testing.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other β-lactams [^112pzJnd]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to evaluation of penicillin allergy, BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with a positive skin test for aminopenicillin but negative skin tests for penicillin determinants are likely to be sensitized to the aminopenicillin side chain.
Consider obtaining a cautious challenge to benzyl or phenoxymethyl penicillin in this situation to ascertain whether the patient has a selective penicillin allergy.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^113vz5NC]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with a beta-lactam antibiotic (BA) allergy label, avoidance of the whole group of BAs leads to displacement of first-line therapies potentially influencing patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Studies previously published on BA cross-reactivity use different sets of BA and seem to contain conflicting recommendations on safe BA alternatives in case of (suspected) BA allergy.

Methods

The objectives were (i) to identify discrepancies between studies regarding cross-allergy in BA and (ii) to identify research gaps. The tables and errata of 4 studies (Romano et al. Trubiano et al. Zagursky et al. SWAB-guideline by Wijnakker et al.) were evaluated and compared head-to-head.

Results

A total of 51 antibiotics were covered by the four authors, theoretically leading to 2550 potential recommendations regarding alternatives in case of specific allergies. Internal discrepancies existed in 2 tables. Since none of the tables included all 51 BAs, in 356 situations data were lacking regarding specific alternatives. In 1104 situations, only one author gave advice about a specific alternative. Harmony and disharmony between authors could be evaluated in 1090 cases. The advice regarding alternative BAs was 696 times in harmony (482 safe, 214 unsafe), while discrepancies were found in 394 cases. This led to a different advice (safe vs. unsafe) in 272 cases or 69%.

Conclusion

Disharmony between authors was identified in 36% of the cases. In 69%, this led to a clinically relevant, different advice. This indicates the need for synchronisation of cross-reactivity tables and answering remaining research gaps.

### Updated guidance: prevention and management of perinatal group BInfection [^111imdin]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis among term infants and a major cause of late-onset sepsis among both term and preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published separate but aligned guidelines in 2019 and 2020 for the prevention and management of perinatal GBS disease. Together, these replace prior consensus guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on antenatal screening for GBS colonization remains the primary recommended approach to prevent perinatal GBS disease, though the optimal window for screening is changed to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than beginning at 35 0/7 weeks' gestation. Penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin are recommended for prophylaxis, with clindamycin and vancomycin reserved for cases of significant maternal penicillin allergy. Pregnant women with a history of penicillin allergy are now recommended to undergo skin testing, because confirmation of or delabeling from a penicillin allergy can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Aligned with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for evaluating newborns for all causes of early-onset sepsis, separate consideration should be given to infants born at less than 35 weeks' and more than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation when performing GBS risk assessment. Empiric antibiotics are recommended for infants at high risk for GBS early-onset disease. Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing GBS early-onset disease, currently there is no approach for the prevention of GBS late-onset disease.

### The burden of self-reported antibiotic allergies in health care and how to address It: a systematic review of the evidence [^115CPhAi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are the first-line treatment for bacterial infections; however, overuse and inappropriate prescribing have made antibiotics less effective with increased antimicrobial resistance. Unconfirmed reported antibiotic allergy labels create a significant barrier to optimal antimicrobial stewardship in health care, with clinical and economic implications.

Objective

A systematic review was conducted to summarize the impact of patient-reported antibiotic allergy on clinical outcomes and various strategies that have been employed to effectively assess and remove these allergy labels, improving patient care.

Methods

The review was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A critical appraisal was conducted on all studies and a narrative synthesis was performed to identify themes.

Results

Four themes emerged: the prevalence of antibiotic allergy, impact of antibiotic allergy on antimicrobial prescribing, impact of antibiotic allergy on clinical outcomes, and delabeling strategies to improve clinical outcomes. Of the 32 studies, including 1,089,675 participants, the prevalence of reported antibiotic allergy was between 5% and 35%. Patients with a reported antibiotic allergy had poorer concordance with prescribing guidelines in 30% to 60% of cases, with a higher use of alternatives such as quinolone, tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, and carbapenem and lower use of beta-lactam antibiotics. Antibiotic allergy delabeling was identified as an intervention and recommendation to advance the state of the science.

Conclusions

There is substantial evidence within the literature that antibiotic allergy labels significantly impact patient clinical outcomes and a consensus that systematic assessment of reported antibiotic allergies, commonly referred to as delabeling, improves the clinical management of patients.

### BSACI guideline for the set-up of penicillin allergy de-labelling services by non-allergists working in a hospital setting [^114ew5K4]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and a committee of experts and key stakeholders have developed this guideline for the evaluation and testing of patients with an unsubstantiated label of penicillin allergy. The guideline is intended for UK clinicians who are not trained in allergy or immunology, but who wish to develop a penicillin allergy de-labelling service for their patients. It is intended to supplement the BSACI 2015 guideline "Management of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactams" and therefore does not detail the epidemiology or aetiology of penicillin allergy, as this is covered extensively in the 2015 guideline (1). The guideline is intended for use only in patients with a label of penicillin allergy and does not apply to other beta-lactam allergies. The recommendations include a checklist to identify patients at low risk of allergy and a framework for the conduct of drug provocation testing by non-allergists. There are separate sections for adults and paediatrics within the guideline, in recognition of the common differences in reported allergy history and likelihood of true allergy.

### EFNS guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: report of an EFNS task force on acute bacterial meningitis in older children and adults [^1167DRVa]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a potentially life-threatening neurological emergency. An agreed protocol for early, evidence-based and effective management of community-acquired ABM is essential for best possible outcome. A literature search of peer-reviewed articles on ABM was used to collect data on the management of ABM in older children and adults. Based on the strength of published evidence, a consensus guideline was developed for initial management, investigations, antibiotics and supportive therapy of community-acquired ABM. Patients with ABM should be rapidly hospitalized and assessed for consideration of lumbar puncture (LP) if clinically safe. Ideally, patients should have fast-track brain imaging before LP, but initiation of antibiotic therapy should not be delayed beyond 3 h after first contact of patient with health service. In every case, blood sample must be sent for culture before initiating antibiotic therapy. Laboratory examination of cerebrospinal fluid is the most definitive investigation for ABM and whenever possible, the choice of antibiotics, and the duration of therapy, should be guided by the microbiological diagnosis. Parenteral therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin is the initial antibiotics of choice in the absence of penicillin allergy and bacterial resistance; amoxicillin should be used in addition if meningitis because of Listeria monocytogenes is suspected. Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for penicillin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis. Dexamethasone should be administered both in adults and in children with or shortly before the first dose of antibiotic in suspected cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. Influenzae meningitis. In patients presenting with rapidly evolving petechial skin rash, antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately on suspicion of Neisseria meningitidis infection with parenteral benzyl penicillin in the absence of known history of penicillin allergy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114YcZys]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Managing Persons Being Tested

Patients who have a positive skin test should not receive ß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be referred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further evaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented in the medical record. Patients who test negative should be informed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is equivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If treatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be administered safely. Documentation of testing results should be provided to the patient.

Desensitization

Desensitization is required for persons who have a documented penicillin allergy and for whom no therapeutic alternatives exist (e.g. syphilis during pregnancy and persons with neurosyphilis). Modified protocols might be considered on the basis of the clinical syndrome, drug of choice, and route of administration. Patients might require referral to a specialty center where desensitization can be performed.

Allergy Referral Resources

With increased access to skin testing kits and the need to better target therapy for gonorrhea and syphilis, programs should identify local allergy consultant resources.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^113N7hpJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Cephalosporin allergy management pathways — risk stratification and outcomes: A clinical pathway that incorporates both cephalosporin generation and cephalosporin side chain can help direct safe use of β-lactam in the setting of previously reported hypersensitivity, though outcome data are limited; similar pathways have been implemented to demonstrate cephalosporin tolerance in patients with historical penicillin allergies, and available data indicate increased β-lactam use and first-line antibiotic treatment with reaction rates observed in 0.5%-4.0% of patients.

### Practical management of antibiotic allergy in adults [^116FeznF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

This review looks at the main issues around immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity relates to β-lactam antibiotics, mainly because of the heavy usage of this class of drugs. Concerns around cross-reactivity always worry clinicians, particularly in the emergency situation. Reasonable data now exist in relation to β-lactam antibiotics and derivatives, which enable appropriate risk management to be undertaken. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^111yjM42]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Material and Methods

For this study, we used the data as published by Romano, Zagursky and its erratum, Trubiano and its erratum, and the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (Dutch acronym: SWAB) guideline for the approach to (suspected) beta‐lactam antibiotic allergy.

Since the terminology differed between the 4 authors, the terminology that was used to address specific beta‐lactam antibiotics and the type of cross‐reactivity was harmonised (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2).

FIGURE 1
Structures of the different beta‐lactam subgroups described by the 4 authors. Symbols corresponding to Table 1. The beta‐lactam antibiotics are structurally related sharing the beta‐lactam ring as the essential core structure. The subgroup classification depends on the chemical nature of the ring fused to the b‐lactam pharmacophore unit. Penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems have an additional ring with a carboxylate group on the same side of the carbonyl group in the β‐lactam ring. (A) Penicillin‐class beta‐lactam antibiotics contain a five membered sulphur containing ring attached to the beta‐lactam ring. The beta lactam‐ring carries a secondary amino group, and substituents (R1) can be attached to this amino group. (B) Carbapenems have a five‐membered ring, as do penicillins, but with the substitution of a carbon atom for the sulphur at C‐1 and a double bond between C‐2 and C‐3. They can contain 3 side chains (R1, R2, R3). (C) Cephalosporins have a six membered sulphur containing ring fused to the beta‐lactam nucleus and contain a R1 and R2 side chain. The R1 side chain consists of a R1 ring and R1 branch chain. (D) In monobactams the beta‐lactam ring is not fused to another ring. This group has a sulfonate group instead of a carboxylate group that is directly attached to the nitrogen atom of the β‐lactam ring.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: updated CDC guideline [^1137wVfq]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus is the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. Universal screening is recommended for pregnant women at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its guideline for the prevention of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease. The new guideline contains six important changes. First, there is a recommendation to consider using sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests, rather than just routine cultures, for detection of group B streptococcus in rectal and vaginal specimens. Second, the colony count required to consider a urine specimen positive is at least 104 colony-forming units per mL. Third, the new guideline presents separate algorithms for management of preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes, rather than a single algorithm for both conditions. Fourth, there are minor changes in the recommended dose of penicillin G for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Fifth, the guideline provides new recommendations about antibiotic regimens for women with penicillin allergy. Cefazolin is recommended for women with minor allergies. For those at serious risk of anaphylaxis, clindamycin is recommended if the organism is susceptible and vancomycin is recommended if there is clindamycin resistance or if susceptibility is unknown. Finally, the new algorithm for secondary prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns should be applied to all infants, not only those at high risk of infection. The algorithm clarifies the extent of evaluation and duration of observation required for infants in different risk categories.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116CwFWy]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) — key research priorities and guideline conclusions are as follows: priorities include determining the outcomes of chronic wet cough following an acute infection in various settings (community and hospital) through multicenter cohort studies; conducting multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on antibiotic efficacy in primary care using validated cough outcome measures, and "Ideally, an objective cough outcome (eg, cough counts) should also be included as an outcome"; determining the optimal length of antibiotics in different circumstances; defining the most appropriate time point for referral for further investigations when specific cough pointers are absent and wet cough persists after antibiotic treatment; and intervention studies to prevent recurrence of PBB, especially for those with very frequent recurrences. The document states that this update of the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines produced new recommendations from systematic reviews addressing two key clinical questions, recognizes PBB as a clinical diagnostic entity not mentioned in the 2006 guidelines, and notes these recommendations were endorsed by the CHEST Expert Cough Panel, with high-quality evidence for most recommendations but remaining gaps particularly in primary care. The guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), and Irish Thoracic Society (ITS).

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other β-lactams [^1157buWX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and paediatric allergy and for other clinicians practising allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a Web-based process and all comments carefully considered. Included in the guideline are epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, molecular structure, formulations available in the UK and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants. Sections on the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins are included. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is discussed in detail. Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures have been made. Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is given in a separate section. An algorithm to help the clinician in the diagnosis of patients with a history of penicillin allergy has also been included.

### The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) guideline for the approach to suspected antibiotic allergy [^1136ZUSJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prudent handling of reported antibiotic allergies is an important aspect of antibiotic stewardship. The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendations for bedside decision-making in antibiotic therapy in patients that report an antibiotic allergy.

Methods

The guideline committee generated 12 key questions, most of which were population, intervention, comparison, and outcome questions relevant to both children and adults with suspected antibiotic allergies. For each question, a systematic literature search was performed and reviewed for the best available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The quality of evidence was graded from very low to high, and recommendations were formulated in structured discussions as strong or weak.

Results

Sixty recommendations were provided for suspected allergy to β-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) and non-β-lactam antibiotics. Owing to the absence of randomized controlled trials in this field, the underlying evidence was predominantly graded as low or very low. Available data support that a detailed allergy history should always be performed and critically appraised. When cross-allergy between BLA groups is not to be expected due to the absence of molecular similarity of the side chains, the patient can be safely exposed to the alternative BLA. An exception to this rule is severe delayed-type reactions in which re-exposure to a BLA should only be considered after consultation with a multidisciplinary team.

Conclusions

Accumulated scientific data now support a more liberal approach that better balances the benefits of treatment with first choice and usually smaller spectrum antibiotics with appropriate avoidance of antibiotics in case of a truly high risk of a (severe) allergic reaction. In The Netherlands, a formal guideline was developed that provides recommendations for the approach toward suspected allergy to BLA and frequently used non-β-lactam antibiotics, thereby strongly supporting antimicrobial stewardship.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^117M3X8S]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Our narrative review certainly has limitations: Firstly, our algorithms have not been graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria and represent the position of the multidisciplinary experts involved in our clinical network. The most recent guidelines on the management of NSTIs were published in 2014 and 2018 and we felt there was a need to provide updated recommendations. Second, our framework has been designed for application in a French network (SURFAST) with our specific regional bacterial ecology, characterized by low MRSA endemicity, high ESBL-E endemicity, and < 10% GAS clindamycin resistance. However, we have endeavoured to provide hierarchical criteria in the choice of antibiotic strategies to make them generalizable. We have also considered different clinical scenarios commonly encountered in the clinical practice (e.g. severe β-lactam allergy, pregnancy, paediatric and neutropenic patients) and have provided practical recommendations or alternatives for clinicians.

### A review of evidence supporting the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for prescribing cephalosporin antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients [^111kxW7F]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, evidence-based guidelines endorse the use of cephalosporin antibiotics for patients with reported allergies to penicillin, for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and acute otitis media. Many physicians, however, remain reluctant to prescribe such agents. Although such concern is understandable, lack of consistent data regarding exactly what constitutes an initial penicillin-allergic reaction and subsequent cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins may be preventing many patients from receiving optimal antibiotic therapy. This article reviews evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation. Included is an examination of the types and incidence of reactions to penicillins and cephalosporins; the frequency of cross-reactivity between these 2 groups of agents; experimental and clinical studies that suggest that side chain-specific antibodies predominate in the immune response to cephalosporins, thereby explaining the lack of cross-sensitivity between most cephalosporins and penicillins; the role of skin testing; and the risks of anaphylaxis. Specific recommendations for the treatment of patients on the basis of their responses to previously prescribed agents are summarized.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

Antibiotic regimen for patients without penicillin allergy: Under the question Does the patient have a penicillin allergy?, use Oral amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times per d, 3–7 d)§; if not feasible, use Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)§; and if first-line treatment fails, broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)§; the guideline notes, Although the expert panel recommends both amoxicillin and penicillin as first-line treatments, amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112q6WhX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy — persistence of sensitization and need for evaluation: Many reported allergies do not persist long term; "Approximately 90% to 95% of patients with a reported penicillin allergy can tolerate a rechallenge after an appropriate allergy evaluation has been performed", and "after 20 years fewer than 1% of patients with initial clinical symptoms compatible with an allergic reaction continue to maintain their sensitivity". Consequently, "a formal allergy evaluation is recommended by both North American and European guidelines to optimize patient management".

### Clinical features of penicillin allergy | Antibiotic prescribing and use… [^1167DorV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Patients may have an inaccurate penicillin allergy label based on a past history of viral rashes, a family history of penicillin allergy, or intolerance to an antibiotic.
- A true penicillin allergy may cause either an immediate hypersensitivity reaction or a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. For immediate hypersensitivity reactions, penicillin allergy-specific IgE antibodies may decrease over time resulting in patients tolerating penicillin-related antibiotics later in life.
- Clinicians can evaluate a penicillin allergy label through different methods, including reviewing a patient's allergy history and conducting a validated risk stratification, followed by penicillin skin testing and/or a direct oral challenge, as appropriate.

Clinical Assessment Assessing a patient's penicillin allergy reaction history is important when deciding about next steps in allergy assessment and treatment selection. Determining Risk Based on a patient's history, penicillin allergy risk categories can be determined. Validated risk stratification tools are available to determine the risk of a positive penicillin allergy test and guide appropriate clinical decisions. Special consideration: delayed hypersensitivity reactions Patients with severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions should not use the offending drug.

A direct oral challenge and skin testing are not appropriate for patients with severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as:

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms
- Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis
- Multifocal bullous fixed drug eruptions
- Drug-induced organ or blood cell injuries High-risk patients and patients with a history of severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions should be referred to a drug allergy specialist. Direct oral challenge A direct oral challenge is a method used to determine if a person with a history of penicillin allergy can safely take "penicillin class" antibiotics.
- Direct oral challenges are generally suitable for low-risk patients as determined through an assessment using validated risk stratification tools.
- A direct oral challenge involves giving a controlled oral dose of amoxicillin under close medical supervision.
- Direct oral challenges should be done with a standard protocol, in a safe setting, under observation, and with rescue medications available.
- A negative skin test should also be followed by a direct oral challenge.

GRADE Methodology

We planned to use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We planned to use methods and recommendations described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using GRADEpro GDT software. The overall "Risk of bias" judgement for each study was planned to be used as part of the GRADE assessment of study limitations. The first version of the Risk of Bias tool was planned to be used due to concerns regarding the difficulty of version 2, even for experienced users, which may result in delays in publication.

We justified all decisions to downgrade the evidence's quality using footnotes and added comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review if necessary.

Data Synthesis Incl. Meta-analyses

For binary (dichotomous) outcomes, we planned to use Risk Ratios (RR). All measures were planned to be presented with a 95% confidence interval. We planned to enter data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect.

We planned to use a random-effects model due to the high probability of heterogeneity in the RCTs and other evidence that might have been included in this review.

We planned to use forest plots to visualize the meta-analysis results and the GRADE methodology for presenting the certainty of the evidence as explained by the Cochrane Handbook. We planned to upload the RevMan files to GRADE GDT to create a summary of findings table for interventional studies.

We planned for all studies to be included in the primary analysis, and to assess the potential effects of studies at high risk or high risk/some concerns, we planned to carry out sensitivity analyses.

Assessment of Heterogeneity

We planned to inspect forest plots visually to consider the direction and magnitude of effects and the degree of overlap between confidence intervals. We planned to use the I² and Tau² statistics to measure heterogeneity among the studies in each analysis. We acknowledged that there is substantial uncertainty in the value of I² when only a small number of studies exist. We also considered the P -value from the Chi² test.

Subgroup Analysis

We planned to carry out subgroup analyses for the following factors for all outcomes but only for our primary time point of interest:

- Children

- Adolescents

- Pregnant women

- Other adults

We planned to use the formal test for subgroup differences in Review Manager 5.4 and base our interpretation on this.

### Standardized testing and written communication improve patient understanding of β-lactam allergy testing outcomes: a multicenter, prospective study [^114cLGfu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Eighteen to 25% of hospital inpatients report an antibiotic allergy. Such patients have longer hospital stays, more Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infections, and a greater chance of intensive care admission and in-hospital mortality, and incur higher costs than do patients without an antibiotic allergy label. Up to 54% of reported antibiotic allergies are to the beta-lactams, commonly referred to as "penicillin allergy".

Delabeling refers to the assessment and testing required to disprove a patient has an immune-mediated reaction to a medication. Antibiotic allergy delabeling can be time and resource-intensive, and requires dedicated challenge clinics and specialized health care staff trained in skin prick and intradermal testing techniques and interpretation and in the management of anaphylaxis. Although many expert consensus guidelines exist, there are no current standardized methods for assessing risk before proceeding to an antibiotic challenge, no standardized testing protocols, and no standards for communicating results to patients and other clinicians to ensure uptake of recommendations.

Antibiotic allergy testing generally results in 80% to 90% of patients being delabeled. However, a recent survey of Australian hospital specialists and pharmacists identified significant barriers to testing, including 42% of respondents who were either unaware of, or did not have access to, antibiotic allergy testing services. Furthermore, there are no published data to demonstrate effectiveness and long-term safety of allergy label removal. A retrospective study with telephone follow-up in Western Australia found that only 50% of delabeled patients were following posttesting recommendations, mainly due to ongoing patient or general practitioner reservations despite the negative testing.

We hypothesized that implementation of an evidence-based, standardized protocol with accurate result dissemination for beta-lactam allergy delabeling would improve testing practices, the proportion of patients appropriately delabeled, and patient understanding 8 weeks after testing.

### Drug allergy practice parameter updates to incorporate into your clinical practice [^1162s6dR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The drug allergy practice parameter was developed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity reactions. It was last updated in 2010. With the growth of research and evidence-based data since then, experts came together to update the practice parameter with a focus on sections that the work group deemed to have significant changes (or were not addressed) in the previous practice parameter. This review is a focused update on aspects of the practice parameter deemed to have the greatest impact on clinical practice and includes significant updates on diagnosis of antibiotic allergy including penicillin, cephalosporin, sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and macrolide allergies. Other topics include the evolution in our management approach to patients with aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug allergy, diagnostic testing for delayed drug hypersensitivity and allergy to chemotherapeutics and biologics, and the key consensus-based statements for clinical practice. Specifically, the updated practice parameter helps allergists understand the place of 1- or 2-step drug challenges that are valuable tools often without the need for skin testing in many clinical situations. A proactive approach to delabeling penicillin allergy as well as unnecessary avoidance of safe antibiotic alternatives for patients with proven penicillin allergy is emphasized. New guidance is provided on management of patients with different phenotypes of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity reactions. Approaches to delayed drug hypersensitivity and use of delayed intradermal and patch testing for specific phenotypes are reviewed. Lastly, practical approaches to management of patients with reactions to chemotherapeutics and biologics are discussed.

### Antimicrobial stewardship's new weapon? A review of antibiotic allergy and pathways to' de-labeling' [^117DebbU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continued emergence of multiresistant pathogens and widespread antimicrobial use has led to a greater emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship programs. Concurrently, an increased awareness of the rising number of antibiotic allergy labels and impact on antimicrobial use has surfaced. The integration of antibiotic allergy de-labeling and antimicrobial stewardship programs may be a pathway worthy of further focus and investigation.

Recent Findings

Recent literature has evaluated the efficacy of antibiotic allergy management (historical de-labeling, in-vitro testing, skin prick testing, intradermal testing, and oral challenges) and impact of antibiotic allergy labels on patient outcome. The importance of true and perceived antibiotic allergy cross-reactivity in the setting of β-lactam allergies has been highlighted. The impact of dedicated antibiotic allergy de-labeling clinics, inpatient antibiotic allergy testing, and integrated antimicrobial stewardship programs has been recently appraised.

Summary

More recent literature supports that appropriate antibiotic allergy in-vitro and in-vivo testing and subsequent antibiotic allergy de-labeling, particularly in regard to β-lactams, can decrease broad-spectrum antibiotic use, costs, patient length of stay, and mortality. Integration of antibiotic allergy management into the decision support systems of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs represents an important opportunity to further improve measured outcomes from antibiotic utilization.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^116HFnJh]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes and statistical analysis

The primary outcome was the proportion of tests indicated by the IDSA guideline. We classified a test as indicated if the McIsaac score was ≥ 2, not indicated if the score was < 2, and indeterminate if it could not be assigned to one of these categories, as described above.

For patients prescribed antibiotics, we classified the prescription as indicated if the McIsaac score was ≥ 2 and the RADT and/or GAS throat culture was positive, not indicated if the tests were negative or if the McIsaac score was < 2 (regardless of RADT and GAS results), and indeterminate if the McIsaac score was indeterminate and the RADT and/or GAS culture was positive. Patients prescribed antibiotics empirically following a negative RADT were not considered to have received antibiotics if they were instructed to stop antibiotics when the culture result returned negative. We classified each antibiotic as a recommended or non-recommended agent according to the IDSA guideline. For patients without a penicillin allergy, recommended antibiotics are penicillin V, amoxicillin, or IM benzathine penicillin G; for patients with a penicillin allergy, recommended antibiotics are cephalexin, cefadroxil, clindamycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. We calculated the proportion of prescribed antibiotics that were recommended agents. Statistical analysis was performed using R software v3.1 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

### Penicillin allergy testing and delabeling for patients who are prescribed penicillin: a systematic review for a World Health Organization guideline [^116qq5ha]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Evidence on the safety and effectiveness of routine penicillin allergy testing among the RHD population is missing. However, severe allergic reactions to penicillin are extremely rare, and routine allergy testing has been discouraged in previous WHO guidance as it may create an unnecessary barrier to the use of antibiotics. Trained healthcare workers can effectively recognize and deal with severe allergic reactions.

Amoxicillin and benzathine penicillin G are still frequently used and have a broad range of indications for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease. Confirmation of penicillin allergy diagnosis or delabeling using PST or direct oral DC seems to be safe and is associated with a low rate of adverse reactions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116eNbdb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

Validating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam Antibiotic Allergy

Evaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining a thorough medical history, including previous exposures to penicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics; 2) performing a skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor determinants; and 3) among those who have a negative penicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with 250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment with the indicated ß-lactam therapy.

For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin (either to the major or minor determinants), treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used. For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic (e.g. a patient with neurosyphilis or a pregnant woman with syphilis) and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance (also referred to as desensitization) is required. Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment.

### The diagnosis and management of antibiotic allergy in children: systematic review to inform a contemporary approach [^111UeYRZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antibiotics are commonly reported among children, with some representing genuine drug allergies. Accurate diagnostic tests are required. Drug provocation testing (DPT) is accepted as the gold standard investigation among children with suspected antibiotic allergy. We conducted this review to ascertain the strength of current evidence for using DPT as the first-line investigation for suspected antibiotic allergy among children.

Methods

Medline was searched in June 2014 for publications investigating antibiotic allergy among children.

Results

865 publications were retrieved and 76 studies selected. ADRs are most common among children of 0–4years, however only some reveal drug allergies. The best evidence demonstrates that around 0.21% of general paediatric outpatients demonstrate positive antibiotic intradermal (ID) testing or DPTs, while 6.8% of children attending emergency departments for suspected β-lactam allergy may fulfil DPT reactions. Four studies used DPT-based protocols to investigate suspected antibiotic allergy, with two of these conducting ID testing and DPTs across all participants. β-lactam and clarithromycin ID testing had sensitivities of 66.7% and 75%, with positive predictive values of 36% and 33%, respectively, when compared with DPT data.

Conclusions

Our literature review found four (6%) publications that performed DPTs to subjects' index antibiotic across all participants. No rigorous evidence supports using skin prick, ID or in vitro diagnostic testing; indeed, the testing regimens, extracts and positivity criteria used are inconsistent. We recommend that suspected non-serious antibiotic allergy should be primarily investigated using DPT-based clinical protocols. Data examining their safety, acceptability and diagnostic performance are required.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^115x7zLb]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence shows that general practice flucloxacillin prescribing increases in summer months, peaking in July. A specialist Insect Bite Group (IBG) within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) were considering whether this seasonal effect might be due to increased presentation with insect bites, and if so whether increased prescribing is appropriate or not. This IBG is within the RCGP overdiagnosis special interest group (OD). The OD group's interest is in inappropriate medicalisation of self-limiting illness and over-use of antibiotics. The group includes general practitioners (GPs), including educators and researchers. We used Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies to undertake an initial analysis/assessment of this problem.

Best practice in the management of insect bites is not as clearly described as it is for other infective conditions such as tonsillitis. Current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on insect bites and stingsstate that "most will not require antibiotics" and recommends the use of antihistamines. GP clinicians (GPCs) may access allied guidance, for example, NICE guidance on impetigorecommends an antiseptic (hydrogen peroxide1% cream) for well patients with localised non-bullous impetigo, and, if not suitable, topical antibiotics. More widespread or severe non-bullous impetigo, and all bullous impetigo, are recommended a course of oral antibiotics, flucloxacillin, first line. Finally, NICE have guidance on erysipelas and cellulitiswhich recommends taking a swab from broken skin, drawing round the area with a pen, and offering an oral antibiotic, first-line flucloxacillin, it also recommends reassessing if worsening or not improving at 2 or 3 days. However, guidelines drawn from committee consensus and published evidence usually describes case studies of severe infection, and may not translate to this common clinical scenario seen in primary care. Applying guidelines in practice requires key clinical judgements concerning which bites need medical management, or whether self-management is more appropriate. For GPCs, it can be difficult to distinguish clinical features of redness and heat from inflammatory reactions or secondary cellulitis.

### Should testing be initiated prior to amoxicillin challenge in children? [^115RgW95]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is the most common antibiotic prescribed in children with increasing use over time. While up to 10% of children are labelled as amoxicillin allergic, most children can tolerate amoxicillin after allergy evaluation. It is well documented that the label of amoxicillin allergy in children is associated with adverse health outcomes such as antibiotic-resistant infections. However, it remains controversial how best to assess children for amoxicillin allergy. While in general it is recommended that skin testing be done prior to drug provocation test in the evaluation of amoxicillin allergy, there is increasing evidence that drug provocation testing could be done in lower risk children without skin testing prior. The goal of this article as a narrative review is to review the strengths and limitations of skin testing prior to drug provocation test in children who have a history of either immediate or non-immediate, reactions to amoxicillin.

### Practical management of antibiotic hypersensitivity in 2017 [^116KQxdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common class of medications that individuals report allergy or intolerance to. Adverse reactions are reported at a predictable rate with all antibiotic use that vary by antibiotic. Antibiotic allergy incidence rates are sex dependent, higher in females than in males. Most of these events are not reproducible or immunologically mediated. Antibiotic allergy prevalence increases with increasing age and is more common in hospitalized populations and in populations that use more antibiotics. Determining potential mechanisms for the observed symptoms of the adverse reactions is the starting point for effective management of antibiotic hypersensitivity. Skin testing and direct challenges are the primary tools used to determine acute tolerance in 2017. Commercially available in vitro testing is not currently clinically useful in determining antibiotic hypersensitivity, with rare exceptions. Desensitization can be used when acute-onset immunologically mediated hypersensitivity is confirmed to safely administer a needed antibiotic. Desensitization is not possible when clinically significant T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity is present. Effective management of antibiotic allergy is an important part of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship program.

### Penicillin allergy testing and delabeling for patients who are prescribed penicillin: a systematic review for a World Health Organization guideline [^1127iwQK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

During the WHO Guideline Committee in April 2023 on presenting these findings, there was a discussion on the prevalence of penicillin allergy labels, and how to approach these patients in areas of high prevalence of ARF/RHD when considered for penicillin treatment (or an alternative antibiotic if found to be truly penicillin allergic), as allergy testing may not be routinely available. According to WHO guidance, this subgroup of patients (i.e. patients requiring penicillin of other antibiotics and labeled as allergic) should be carefully examined and their antibiotic risk level should be determined, hence they cannot be assessed using the original PICO which included "doing nothing" as the comparator. Discussion in the April meeting covered the role of PST, and potential alternatives, as low-dose direct DC, for confirming or removing a penicillin allergy label. To address this specific sub-group that would not be addressed by the initial PICO question, we ran a simple search strategy on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7 of 12, July 2023), PubMed, and Embase on 31st of July 2023 using the expression: "penicillin allergy" AND "trial". The aim was to understand in patients with suspected penicillin allergy what is the safest method to delabel a penicillin allergy or to confirm a diagnosis. Studies were identified using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, but the PICO had changes to the population and comparator:
Population: patients with suspected penicillin allergy (self-reported by the patient or their guardian, or patient history);
Intervention: as before (laboratory investigations, PST, or direct DC).
Comparator: different approach to the one used in the intervention group.
Outcomes: as before (primary endpoint: allergic reactions to penicillin; secondary endpoints: anaphylactic shocks, vasovagal reactions, arrhythmias, treatment adherence, acceptability and adverse events).

Antimicrobial agents — penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

ICU infections

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^115Gz6jP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) — β-lactam allergy assessments and PCN skin testing: In patients with a history of β-lactam allergy, we suggest that ASPs promote allergy assessments and PCN skin testing when appropriate (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). PCN "allergy" is reported in 10%–15% of patients and 58%–85% of those requiring antibiotic therapy, and compared with nonallergic patients, those labeled as PCN allergic are exposed to more alternative antibiotics, have increased prevalence of C. difficile, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and other resistant infections, and have longer hospital stays. Properly performed skin testing has a negative predictive value of 97%–99% and a positive predictive value of 50%; in one series, all but one of 146 patients with a negative skin test tolerated β-lactam therapy, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99%, and the use of skin testing to guide therapy yielded an annual savings of $82 000 at a university teaching hospital.

Pediatric penicillin allergy — direct amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing is endorsed with strong recommendation for benign cutaneous histories, and single-dose challenge is recommended for limited, non-severe rashes. The guideline states: "We recommend against penicillin skin testing prior to direct amoxicillin challenge in pediatric patients with a history of benign cutaneous reaction (such as MDE or urticaria)", with "Strength of Recommendation: Strong" and "Certainty of Evidence: Moderate". For appropriate presentations, "single-dose amoxicillin challenge without prior allergy testing is recommended", although "the safety of this approach has not been thoroughly examined in primary care settings", and "penicillin skin testing may be performed at the discretion of the clinician". While skin testing may "overdiagnose" because the "PPV [is] < 100%", not testing and hence not challenging means " ≥ 90% of the patients will continue to be falsely labeled as penicillin-allergic".

Alternative considerations

Elimination diets

The JTFPP conditionally recommends against specific food elimination diets, with a low certainty of evidence, as opposed to an unrestricted diet owing to the risk of development of an IgE-mediated food allergy or malnutrition. The AAD does not provide an updated statement of its previous 2014 recommendation regarding elimination diets, which stated that "food elimination diets based solely on the findings of food allergy test results are not recommended for the management of AD".

Allergen immunotherapy

The JTFPP conditionally recommends allergen immunotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Alternatively, the JTFPP recommends against allergen immunotherapy in patients with mild AD alone, with the consideration that it may be of benefit if a patient has other allergic comorbidities with relevant sensitizations. These recommendations are made with a moderate certainty of evidence. The AAD does not discuss the use of allergy immunotherapy in either its previous guidelines or its current guidelines.

Oral antibiotics

The AAD states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation on the use of oral antibiotics for secondary infection, but it notes that their use "should be limited to instances of clinically evident infection". The JTFPP does not provide a GRADE recommendation, although it states that there is "no significant improvement across outcomes" when using oral antibiotics for AD.

Other interventions

### Antibiotic stewardship when an allergy label is present… [^115LYT6v]. blogs.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

I am fortunate to be part of a group of researchers that developed criteria to classify patient allergy reports into "low-risk" or "more concerning. " 4, 7, 8 Based on our research, we found patient allergy reports that "sounded low-risk" turned out to be low-risk. Patients with low-risk symptoms using our criteria almost always had negative results from skin testing, and these same patients almost always tolerated the test doses of penicillin without developing any symptoms. My team started offering oral challenge doses without skin testing to patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy label in the hospital who were recovering from intensive care. 7, 9, 10 Results showed 60–70% of the patients reported low-risk symptoms. Over two years, 1 in 205 low-risk patients had a rash after a test dose of amoxicillin. Based on our study, 204 patients were able to say goodbye to their penicillin allergy.

Therefore, in order to disprove a low-risk penicillin allergy label, it does not appear we need to do skin testing at all. We need to be good listeners and offer patients an amoxicillin test dose under observation in a safe medical setting. Upon a review of recent data, this approach to low-risk penicillin allergies was recently recommended as a preferred practice by national allergy organizations in the U. S.
- Have you ever had to use an alternative antibiotic because of a penicillin allergy label.
- If so, did you ever encounter a scenario where you thought "I wonder if the alternative antibiotic didn't work well enough. "
- Have you ever thought about testing a penicillin allergy label, rather than working around it.
- What if we all began to proactively work on getting rid of unnecessary low-risk penicillin allergy labels.
- If you knew that there were validated risk-assessments that could help you evaluate patients with low-risk penicillin allergies in your own practice and administer a test dose under medical observation, would you do it. At our institution, we are already seeing the benefits of implementing validated risk assessments and test doses by pharmacists, infectious diseases doctors, pediatricians, obstetricians, and adult primary care doctors, in addition to allergists. We are helping set patients free of penicillin allergy labels so they can take the best treatment for their infection. I think the time is right to become better stewards of our antibiotic allergy labels.

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that > 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines serve to aid practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains regarding the disparity of guideline recommendations as well as some recommendations being outdated. This review presents 3 illustrative case studies designed to provide some clarity with regard to these guidelines. Case 1 is a typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous 2 weeks. Case 2 is a more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy that ultimately requires referral to an otolaryngologist. Case 3 is an atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan. It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide some helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^111iWaeX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS OF GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION

Table I provides a synopsis of recommendations regarding systemic oral antibiotics from several recently published guidelines: the International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR) 2021, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020, the Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Guideline (CSACSO) from 2020, the Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Adult Sinusitis (CPGAS) from 2015, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) update from 2014. Oral and topical corticosteroids are often recommended in combination with antibiotics.

Whereas earlier guidelines usually included antibiotics as a recommended treatment of CRS, more recent guidelines suggest antibiotics be regarded as an optional treatment for CRS, in association with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, saline rinses and surgery.(,–) Whereas in 2007, long term macrolide therapy received a class A recommendation from the EPOS for the treatment of CRSsNP, 307 after subsequent publications by Wallwork et al. and Videler et al. the EPOS recommendation was downgraded from A to C (not including exacerbations) in 2012. The EPOS 2020 steering group made recommendations using the GRADE system, and their overall recommendation was "uncertain" due to the relatively low quality of the available evidence. EPOS 2020 called for studies with larger population sizes, and placebo-controlled randomized trials of long-term macrolides are currently underway.

ICAR 2021 recommended against non-macrolide antibiotics for CRSwNP, except in acute exacerbations. Macrolides were considered as an option for treatment of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP, but the optimal drug, dosage and treatment duration were not defined due to the limited published data.

The Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP patients with neutrophilic inflammatory patterns and low IgE levels, but no antibiotics for CRSwNP patients. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy post-surgery was discussed to improve the subjective and objective symptom scores, reduce polyp size and delay polyp recurrence. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy was recommended for corticosteroid-resistant CRSwNP patients, neutrophil-dominant nasal polyps, persistent edema of nasal mucosa, and purulent nasal discharge.

### The effects of β-lactam allergy relabeling on antibiotic prescribing practices [^113z7Rmo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergy labels are highly prevalent but rarely indicate an allergic intolerance. These patient-reported allergies lead to broad-spectrum antibiotic use, conferred resistance, increased expense, and adverse effects.

Objective

To implement and assess the impact of a history-based clinical guideline that directs antibiotic management and beta-lactam allergy relabeling for patients reporting beta-lactam allergies.

Methods

Patients with beta-lactam allergy labels were identified by our trained multidisciplinary team in diverse clinical settings. This quality improvement project was conducted to evaluate the safety and impact of the guideline on antibiotic use by comparing prescribing practices before and after guideline implementation.

Results

A total of 79 patients with beta-lactam allergies were identified (penicillins-90%, cephalosporins-10%). After guideline implementation, outcomes of allergy relabeling included the following: (1) complete removal, indicating an unlikely true allergy (27%); (2) updated to detail successfully tolerated beta-lactam courses (48%); or (3) no change made to current label (25%). Beta-lactam antibiotic courses before and after guideline implementation compared with total antibiotic courses: allergy removed (44% vs 70%; P < .001), allergy updated (32% vs 68%; P < .001), and no change (27% vs 41%; p = 0.08). Compared with before guideline implementation, beta-lactam antibiotics were 3 times more likely to be prescribed after allergy assessment (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–4.3; P < .05).

Conclusion

The implementation of the beta-lactam allergy clinical guideline resulted in most patients' allergy labels being removed or advantageously updated. These allergy label changes correlated with a substantial increase in the percentage of beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed. After guideline implementation, beta-lactam antibiotics had a 3-fold increased odds of being prescribed independent of allergy label outcome.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^111ha7rk]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — management with penicillin allergy: Recent publications indicate that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin or amoxicillin allergy appears to be almost nil and no greater than the risk among patients without such allergy, so patients allergic to amoxicillin with a non–type 1 (late or delayed, > 72 hours) hypersensitivity reaction can safely be treated with cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, and patients with a history of a serious type 1 immediate or accelerated (anaphylactic) reaction to amoxicillin can also safely be treated with these agents. Clinicians may wish to determine individual tolerance by referral to an allergist for penicillin and/or cephalosporin skin-testing before initiation of therapy. The susceptibility of S pneumoniae to cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime varies from 60% to 75%, and the susceptibility of H influenzae varies from 85% to 100%. In young children (< 2 years) with a serious type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin and moderate or more severe sinusitis, it may be prudent to use a combination of clindamycin (or linezolid) and cefixime; linezolid has excellent activity against all S pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, but lacks activity against H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Alternatively, a quinolone such as levofloxacin may be prescribed, and resistance of pneumococcus and H influenzae to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin is sufficient to preclude their use for acute bacterial sinusitis in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^112oRUTg]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — antibiotic decision pathway and selections for immunocompetent adult patients when definitive, conservative dental treatment (DCDT) is immediately available: "Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis" is managed with "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". For "Pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess", the pathway asks "Does the patient have systemic involvement?"; without systemic involvement it states "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT", and with systemic involvement it states "YES ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". When antibiotics are indicated, for patients without a penicillin allergy use "Oral amoxicillin (500 milligrams, 3 times per day, 3–7 d)" or "Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and if first-line treatment fails "broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)". For penicillin-allergic patients, the pathway asks about a "history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin"; without such history use "Oral cephalexin (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and with such history use "Oral azithromycin (loading dose of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for an additional 4 d) or oral clindamycin (300 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)".

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^1113P29T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Drug allergy history-based beta-lactam allergy pathways — implementation and scope: We recommend that allergist-immunologists collaborate with hospitals and health care systems to implement beta-lactam allergy pathways to improve antibiotic stewardship outcomes (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). Complementary to the recommendations above, integrated beta-lactam pathways can be used for patients that acutely need a beta-lactam antibiotic in the hospital setting and are defined as coordinated programs that facilitate beta-lactam allergy assessments for patients in the emergency department, those who are hospitalized, and those who are perioperative as part of antibiotic stewardship. A recent nonsystematic review identified 36 articles describing acute care beta-lactam pathways, with interventions based solely on the allergy history (n = 8), using the allergy history with direct drug challenges (n = 2), penicillin skin testing (n = 15), or both comprehensive pathways including all allergy procedures (n = 11). An important consideration is that pathways not delabeling-focused may not remove the allergy label, so subsequent outpatient allergy/immunology evaluation requires appropriate follow-up.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients without a penicillin allergy who do not respond to first-line therapy: Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients without a penicillin allergy fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral amoxicillin or oral penicillin V potassium, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

At the International Drug Allergy Symposium during the 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/World Allergy Organization Joint Congress in Orlando, Florida, drug allergy pathways were discussed from international perspectives with a focus on beta-lactam allergy pathways and pragmatic approaches for acute care hospitals. In this expert consensus document, we review current pathways, and detail important considerations in devising, implementing, and evaluating beta-lactam allergy pathways for hospitalized patients. We describe the key patient and institutional factors that must be considered in risk stratification, the central feature of pathway design. We detail shared obstacles to widespread beta-lactam allergy pathway implementation and identify potential solutions to address these challenges.

### Penicillin skin testing… [^112vP8gX]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Validating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam Antibiotic Allergy Evaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining a thorough medical history, including previous exposures to penicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation. In addition, a family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with ß-lactam antibiotics. This practice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and for preoperative prophylaxis.

Managing Persons Being Tested Patients who have a positive skin test should not receive ß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be referred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further evaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented in the medical record. Patients who test negative should be informed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is equivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If treatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be administered safely. Documentation of testing results should be provided to the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

Penicillin allergy (PA) evaluation for surgical prophylaxis — patients who report a PA may be evaluated for true hypersensitivity and high-risk reactions, and delabeling a penicillin-allergic patient can facilitate appropriate use of a preoperative prophylactic beta-lactam antibiotic and improve outcomes (Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence). PA labels are common ("8% to 25%"), yet in a test-dose study 40 of 1046 patients (3.8%) had confirmed beta-lactam hypersensitivity and only 3 had a severe reaction. PA reporting has been associated with increased SSI risk (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02–2.22) and with less cefazolin use (12% vs 92%; p < 0.001) and more clindamycin (49% vs 3%; p < 0.001), vancomycin (35% vs 3%; p < 0.001), and gentamicin (24% vs 3%; p < 0.001). Another study found higher SSI among those reporting PA versus those without penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (OR 3.26; 95% CI, 2.71–3.93), underscoring the importance of delabeling.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^1169k4Yf]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

In patients with a beta‐lactam antibiotic (BA) allergy label, avoidance of the whole group of BAs leads to displacement of first‐line therapies potentially influencing patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Studies previously published on BA cross‐reactivity use different sets of BA and seem to contain conflicting recommendations on safe BA alternatives in case of (suspected) BA allergy.

Methods

The objectives were (i) to identify discrepancies between studies regarding cross‐allergy in BA and (ii) to identify research gaps. The tables and errata of 4 studies (Romano et al. Trubiano et al. Zagursky et al. SWAB‐guideline by Wijnakker et al.) were evaluated and compared head‐to‐head.

Results

A total of 51 antibiotics were covered by the four authors, theoretically leading to 2550 potential recommendations regarding alternatives in case of specific allergies. Internal discrepancies existed in 2 tables. Since none of the tables included all 51 BAs, in 356 situations data were lacking regarding specific alternatives. In 1104 situations, only one author gave advice about a specific alternative. Harmony and disharmony between authors could be evaluated in 1090 cases. The advice regarding alternative BAs was 696 times in harmony (482 safe, 214 unsafe), while discrepancies were found in 394 cases. This led to a different advice (safe vs. unsafe) in 272 cases or 69%.

Conclusion

Disharmony between authors was identified in 36% of the cases. In 69%, this led to a clinically relevant, different advice. This indicates the need for synchronisation of cross‐reactivity tables and answering remaining research gaps.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^117LoDad]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — Summary of recommendations for treatment-naive patients: For treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, BQT (preferably optimized — as discussed below) for 14 days is the preferred option when the antimicrobial susceptibility profile is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB dual therapy for 14 days are suitable alternatives as empiric therapy in patients without penicillin allergy. In patients with unknown antibiotic susceptibility and no history of macrolide exposure or penicillin allergy, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy for 14 days is preferred over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy when no other obvious first-line treatment option is available.
