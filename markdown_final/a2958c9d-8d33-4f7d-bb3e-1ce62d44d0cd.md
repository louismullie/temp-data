## Question

corticosteroids in septic shock

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of corticosteroids in septic shock, including when to use them, which regimen to choose, expected benefits and harms, and how guidelines frame the decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions that trigger steroid consideration. Then, I should verify the historical evolution from high-dose to low-dose strategies. Next, I will review the highest-quality trials and meta-analyses to appraise mortality and physiologic outcomes. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. Then, I will examine dosing, timing, and duration, including the role of fludrocortisone. I should also assess safety signals and monitoring needs. Finally, I will consider special populations, especially pediatrics, and synthesize a practical, bedside approach with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Septic shock is defined by vasopressor requirement to maintain perfusion and elevated lactate despite adequate fluids, and the steroid question arises when shock persists despite fluids and vasopressors, typically when norepinephrine needs are at least moderate, around 0.25 mcg/kg/min for several hours, which is the threshold used in contemporary trials and guidelines [^116W4yAm].

> I need to check the historical trajectory because it shapes current practice. Early eras favored high-dose, short-course glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory therapy, but multiple trials and meta-analyses showed harm or no benefit, so the paradigm shifted toward prolonged, low-dose hydrocortisone to address critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency and vasopressor-refractory shock physiology, which is the foundation of modern recommendations [^111XkAu5] [^115WQEad] [^117AjqHk].

> Next, I should review the pivotal trials with a careful eye on mortality and physiologic endpoints. The ADRENAL trial, with 3,658 adults, found no statistically significant 90-day mortality reduction with hydrocortisone but did show faster shock resolution and more vasopressor-free days, which are clinically meaningful even if mortality is unchanged [^114W8FHM]. In contrast, APROCCHSS, with 1,241 adults, found that hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone reduced 90-day mortality, suggesting a potential advantage of mineralocorticoid co-therapy in selected patients [^114W8FHM]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across syntheses; a patient-level meta-analysis pooling 24 trials and 8,528 patients reported a marginal mortality effect overall for hydrocortisone, with a more pronounced signal when fludrocortisone was added, reinforcing the idea that benefit, if present, is modest and regimen-dependent [^113pjPTo].

> I will now examine meta-analytic data to quantify benefits and harms. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses show that low-dose hydrocortisone accelerates shock reversal by roughly 1–2 days and reduces ICU length of stay, while mortality effects are small and uncertain overall, with estimates around a 2–3% absolute risk reduction that does not consistently reach statistical significance across all analyses [^111X8EoZ] [^113xYeKF]. Wait, let me verify safety; corticosteroids increase hyperglycemia and hypernatremia and may increase neuromuscular weakness, though superinfection and gastrointestinal bleeding have not shown consistent increases in pooled analyses, which still warrants vigilant monitoring in practice [^111X8EoZ] [^113xYeKF].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 issues a weak recommendation to consider IV corticosteroids for adults with septic shock who require ongoing vasopressors, reflecting the modest and inconsistent mortality signal but consistent physiologic benefits, and it upgrades the evidence quality to moderate for some outcomes despite the weak recommendation strength [^111ZZKJv] [^116W4yAm]. The 2024 SCCM focused update similarly suggests corticosteroids for adult septic shock and explicitly recommends against high-dose, short-duration regimens, aligning with the modern low-dose approach and the historical harm seen with high-dose strategies [^116EoAze] [^114QTaca]. The BMJ Rapid Recommendation makes a weak recommendation to consider corticosteroids broadly in sepsis, emphasizing shared decision-making given small and uncertain mortality benefits and potential harms, which is consistent with the trial heterogeneity and patient heterogeneity observed in the literature [^116yLkZk] [^112pDjMW].

> Let me think about dosing, timing, and duration, because these operational details matter. The standard regimen is hydrocortisone 200 mg/day, given as 50 mg IV every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion, typically for about 5–7 days or until vasopressors are weaned, with some protocols tapering if treatment extends beyond a week to avoid abrupt withdrawal in prolonged critical illness physiology [^116W4yAm] [^117Gd33W]. I should double-check the role of fludrocortisone; while not universally required, APROCCHSS supports adding 50 mcg/day of oral fludrocortisone when using hydrocortisone, and some clinicians adopt this strategy in refractory shock given the mortality signal in that trial, acknowledging that not all guidelines mandate it [^114W8FHM] [^113pjPTo]. Regarding timing, although definitive randomized data are limited, retrospective analyses suggest earlier initiation, within about 6–8 hours of shock onset, may be associated with improved outcomes, so if steroids are going to be used, it is reasonable not to delay unnecessarily once vasopressor-refractory shock is established [^113DYSmb] [^111VDVa3].

> I need to ensure I weigh benefits against harms and set a monitoring plan. Expected benefits include faster shock reversal, fewer vasopressor days, and possibly a small reduction in short-term mortality in some analyses, while harms include hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and possible neuromuscular weakness. Superinfection and gastrointestinal bleeding have not shown consistent increases, but vigilance is prudent, especially in patients with diabetes, renal dysfunction, or high catabolic risk [^111X8EoZ] [^113xYeKF]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring; frequent glucose checks, electrolyte surveillance for sodium, and assessment for ICU-acquired weakness are warranted during the steroid course, with a low threshold to reassess the indication daily as shock resolves [^notfound].

> But wait, what about special populations, especially children. Pediatric data remain limited and heterogeneous, with no high-quality RCT demonstrating mortality benefit and observational signals of harm or no benefit; thus, pediatric guidelines suggest against routine hydrocortisone if fluids and vasopressors restore stability, and allow either hydrocortisone or no steroids if shock remains refractory, with explicit exceptions for children with known adrenal insufficiency or recent etomidate exposure where stress-dose steroids are indicated [^117W6873] [^115jhFnk] [^112TTH8C]. I should confirm that ongoing pediatric RCTs may soon refine this space, but current practice should be conservative and individualized in children [^112TTH8C].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to avoid overstatement. The most consistent, reproducible benefit of low-dose hydrocortisone is faster shock reversal and reduced vasopressor exposure, with a modest and uncertain mortality effect that varies by trial design, patient risk, and regimen, particularly with the addition of fludrocortisone in some studies. Therefore, the decision to use steroids should be individualized, anchored in guideline-supported consideration for vasopressor-refractory shock, and framed as reasonable but optional rather than mandatory [^113pjPTo] [^111ZZKJv] [^116yLkZk]. I should double-check that this aligns with bedside pragmatism; many clinicians use hydrocortisone when norepinephrine requirements are rising or persistently high after adequate resuscitation, while recognizing that some patients will not benefit and that shared decision-making with surrogates is appropriate when the mortality benefit is small and uncertain [^116W4yAm] [^116yLkZk].

> Finally, I should translate this into a practical approach. After confirming septic shock and ensuring timely antibiotics, source control, and fluids, if vasopressor requirements remain at or above approximately 0.25 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine for several hours, consider initiating hydrocortisone 200 mg/day in divided doses or continuous infusion for about 5–7 days or until vasopressors are discontinued, with optional addition of fludrocortisone 50 mcg/day based on APROCCHSS, and with daily reassessment of ongoing need. Monitor glucose and sodium closely and watch for ICU-acquired weakness, discontinuing steroids if shock resolves and vasopressors are weaned [^116W4yAm] [^114W8FHM] [^116EoAze]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing; while not definitive, not delaying unnecessarily once refractory shock is established is reasonable given observational associations, but steroids should not precede antibiotics, fluids, and source control, which remain foundational [^113DYSmb] [^114fvkcb].

Corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** for adults with septic shock who require ongoing vasopressor support, with low-to-moderate certainty of evidence [^111ZZKJv] [^116W4yAm]. They **do not reduce mortality** in septic shock [^113pjPTo] but **do accelerate shock reversal** and reduce vasopressor requirements, which can shorten ICU stay and mechanical ventilation [^113xYeKF] [^113pjPTo]. The preferred regimen is **hydrocortisone 200 mg/day** (50 mg every 6 hours or continuous infusion) for 5–7 days, with or without fludrocortisone [^116W4yAm] [^113pjPTo]. High-dose or short-course steroids are not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^114QTaca] [^111XkAu5]. Use cautiously in patients with hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, or active infection, and monitor for hyperglycemia, infections, and neuromuscular weakness [^111X8EoZ] [^113pjPTo].

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) 2021**: Recommends IV corticosteroids for adults with septic shock requiring ongoing vasopressor therapy (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) [^111ZZKJv] [^116W4yAm].

- **Society of critical care medicine (SCCM) 2024**: Suggests corticosteroids for adult septic shock; recommends against high-dose/short-duration regimens (> 400 mg/day hydrocortisone for < 3 days) [^116EoAze] [^114QTaca].

- **BMJ 2018**: Weak recommendation to consider corticosteroids in sepsis with or without shock, balancing small mortality reduction against increased neuromuscular weakness [^116yLkZk].

---

## Clinical outcomes

### Benefits

- **Shock reversal**: Faster resolution of shock and reduced vasopressor requirements [^113xYeKF] [^114W8FHM].

- **ICU stay**: Shorter ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation [^113xYeKF] [^114W8FHM].

- **Mortality**: Possible small reduction in short-term mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84–1.03) [^111X8EoZ] [^1179y2LX].

---

### Risks

- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased risk of hyperglycemia [^111X8EoZ] [^117AjqHk].

## Recommended corticosteroid regimens

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hydrocortisone | 200 mg/day (50 mg every 6 hours or continuous infusion) | 5–7 days | Strong recommendation |
| Hydrocortisone + fludrocortisone | 200 mg/day + 50 mcg/day | 5–7 days | Moderate recommendation |
| High-dose/short-course | > 400 mg/day for < 3 days | Not recommended | Strong recommendation against [^116EoAze] |

---

## Patient selection criteria

Use corticosteroids in adults with **septic shock requiring ongoing vasopressor support** despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^111ZZKJv] [^116W4yAm]. Do not use corticosteroids in **sepsis without shock**, as there is no proven benefit and potential harm [^117Up3Pf] [^115Y1Gwa].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Hyperglycemia**: Monitor closely and adjust insulin therapy [^111X8EoZ] [^117AjqHk].

- **Infections**: Watch for secondary infections and adjust antibiotics as needed [^117W6873].

- **Neuromuscular weakness**: Assess regularly and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if significant weakness develops [^111X8EoZ] [^116W4yAm].

---

## Special populations

In pediatrics, **routine corticosteroid use is not recommended**; consider only in refractory shock with careful monitoring [^117W6873] [^115jhFnk]. In immunocompromised patients, **use cautiously** due to increased infection risk [^notfound].

---

Corticosteroids are **adjunctive therapy** for septic shock, accelerating shock reversal and reducing vasopressor needs, but **do not clearly reduce mortality**. Use hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for 5–7 days in patients requiring ongoing vasopressors, avoid high-dose/short-course regimens, and monitor for hyperglycemia, infections, and neuromuscular weakness [^116W4yAm] [^116EoAze].

What you need to know

Sepsis is a syndrome of life threatening infection with organ dysfunction, and most guidelines do not advise use of corticosteroids to treat it in the absence of refractory shock
Two new trials of corticosteroid treatment for sepsis came to differing conclusions
Corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death by a small amount and increase neuromuscular weakness by a small amount, but the evidence is not definitive
This guideline makes a weak recommendation for corticosteroids in patients with sepsis; both steroids and no steroids are reasonable management options
Fully informed patients who value avoiding death over quality of life and function would likely choose corticosteroids

Do corticosteroids reduce death or improve recovery in people with sepsis or septic shock? Our panel make a weak recommendation to give corticosteroids to people with all types and severity of sepsis, based on new evidence. Because we are not certain that they are beneficial, it is also reasonable not to prescribe them. Patients' values and preferences may guide this decision-making process.

This rapid recommendation was triggered by two trials, with differing conclusions whose results might change practice:

ADRENAL (3658 patients who had septic shock) found no statistically significant difference in 90 day mortality between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups.
APROCCHSS (1241 patients who had septic shock) found that hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone reduced 90 day mortality.

The trials are incorporated into a linked systematic review comparing corticosteroids with placebo. This BMJ Rapid Recommendation promptly and transparently translates this evidence using GRADE methodology for trustworthy guidelines. Sepsis is a life threatening organ dysfunction from infection. Currently most guidelines advise against giving corticosteroids in sepsis in the absence of refractory shock, but these guidelines have not taken into account the new evidence. We do not anticipate that new clinical trials will substantively alter the evidence suggesting a small but uncertain mortality reduction.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^113Rha6n]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is one of the most common causes of death in patients admitted to the ICU. Despite advances in early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, initial resuscitation, source control, and organ support, septic shock remains a major source of short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality. Although multiple adjunctive therapies for septic shock have been developed and studied in clinical trials, few of these methods have demonstrated improvements in survival. Corticosteroid treatment has been studied extensively as adjunctive therapy in patients with septic shock for over 40 years. Initial trials investigating a short course of high-dose corticosteroid as an anti-inflammatory regimen found no evidence of a survival benefit. In contrast, more recent trials demonstrated that a longer course (≥ 5 days) of low-dose corticosteroid resulted in shock reversal and improved mortality rate. Based primarily on a large randomized, multicenter, controlled study performed by Annane et al. the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend the use of low-dose corticosteroid in patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors despite fluid replacement. Recently, however, the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock (CORTICUS) study by Sprung et al. did not demonstrate an improvement in mortality rate after low-dose corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock. The contradictory findings of these two large multicenter studies generated controversy regarding the appropriateness of corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock.

Although a number of factors may have accounted for the differences in the results of these two large multicenter studies, the difference in the time window of enrollment should be considered. Annane et al. initially enrolled patients in the study within three hours of the onset of shock, and this time window from the onset of septic shock to randomization was increased to eight hours. In contrast, in the CORTICUS study, patients were required to undergo randomization within 24 hours after the onset of septic shock, and this time window was subsequently increased to 72 hours. Therefore, it is probable that the benefit of low-dose corticosteroid therapy may diminish with a delay in instituting the treatment. However, there have been no reports regarding the association between the timing of corticosteroid therapy and mortality in patients with septic shock. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical data from patients who received low-dose corticosteroid therapy for septic shock to determine whether early initiation of this therapy is associated with decreased mortality in such cases.

### Do low-dose corticosteroids improve mortality or shock reversal in patients with septic shock? A systematic review and position statement prepared for the American academy of emergency medicine [^116JFtJL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The management of septic shock has undergone a significant evolution in the past decade. A number of trials have been published to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroid administration in patients with septic shock.

Methods

The Sepsis Sub-committee of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Clinical Practice Committee performed an extensive search of the contemporary literature and identified seven relevant trials.

Results

Six of the seven trials reported a mortality outcome of patients in septic shock. Analysis of the data revealed that the relative risk (RR) of 28-day all-cause mortality in septic shock patients who received low-dose corticosteroids was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.07). All seven trials reported data concerning shock reversal or the withdrawal of vasopressors. Pooled results revealed that the RR of shock reversal is 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.28), which suggests that there may be significant improvement in shock reversal after corticosteroid administration. It is important to understand that two of the seven studies reviewed were disproportionately represented and accounted for 799 of 1005 patients (80%) considered for this recommendation.

Conclusions

The evidence suggests that low-dose corticosteroids may reverse shock faster; however, mortality is not improved for the overall population.

### Role of corticosteroids in septic shock [^1158Y1mY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To highlight the role of relative adrenal insufficiency in the outcome of critically ill patients with sepsis and systematically review the literature regarding the use of corticosteroids for management of severe sepsis/septic shock.

Data Sources

A computerized search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database was undertaken from 1966 to March 2003 using the search terms intensive care unit, critical care, corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, and septic shock. Bibliographies of all articles retrieved were searched for relevant articles not identified by the computerized search.

Data Extraction/Synthesis

Six trials were identified after publication of the meta-analyses (1995), with a total of 505 patients. The results of these trials in septic shock suggest that low-dose corticosteroids can reduce vasopressor requirements and hasten reversal of shock. Some of these trials suggested a possible mortality benefit from therapy, and no trial demonstrated an increase in mortality or significant adverse effects. The benefit of this therapy may depend on the presence of relative adrenal insufficiency, as identified by the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test.

Conclusions

Low-dose corticosteroids should be administered to patients with septic shock empirically, but should be discontinued if relative adrenal insufficiency is not confirmed.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Corticosteroids in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock in adults: a systematic review [^117AjqHk]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

The benefit of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial.

Objective

We examined the benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in severe sepsis and septic shock and the influence of dose and duration.

Data Sources

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (through March 2009) databases as well as reference lists of articles and proceedings of major meetings, and we contacted trial authors.

Study Selection

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of corticosteroids vs placebo or supportive treatment in adult patients with severe sepsis/septic shock per the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus definition were included.

Data Extraction

All reviewers agreed on trial eligibility. One reviewer extracted data, which were checked by the other reviewers and by the trials' authors whenever possible. Some unpublished data were obtained from the trials' authors. The primary outcome for this review was 28-day mortality.

Results

We identified 17 randomized trials (n = 2138) and 3 quasi-randomized trials (n = 246) that had acceptable methodological quality to pool in a meta-analysis. Twenty-eight-day mortality for treated vs control patients was 388/1099 (35.3%) vs 400/1039 (38.5%) in randomized trials (risk ratio [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–1.00; p = 0.05; I(2) = 53% by random-effects model) and 28/121 (23.1%) vs 24/125 (19.2%) in quasi-randomized trials (RR, 1.05, 95% CI, 0.69–1.58; p = 0.83). In 12 trials investigating prolonged low-dose corticosteroid treatment, 28-day mortality for treated vs control patients was 236/629 (37.5%) vs 264/599 (44%) (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.97; p = 0.02). This treatment increased 28-day shock reversal (6 trials; 322/481 [66.9%] vs 276/471 [58.6%]; RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.23; p = 0.02; I(2) = 4%) and reduced intensive care unit length of stay by 4.49 days (8 trials; 95% CI, -7.04 to -1.94; P < .001; I(2) = 0%) without increasing the risk of gastroduodenal bleeding (13 trials; 65/800 [8.1%] vs 56/764 [7.3%]; p = 0.50; I(2) = 0%), superinfection (14 trials; 184/998 [18.4%] vs 170/950 [17.9%]; p = 0.92; I(2) = 8%), or neuromuscular weakness (3 trials; 4/407 [1%] vs 7/404 [1.7%]; p = 0.58; I(2) = 30%). Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (9 trials; 363/703 [51.6%] vs 308/670 [46%]; P < .001; I(2) = 0%) and hypernatremia (3 trials; 127/404 [31.4%] vs 77/401 [19.2%]; P < .001; I(2) = 0%).

Conclusions

Corticosteroid therapy has been used in varied doses for sepsis and related syndromes for more than 50 years, with no clear benefit on mortality. Since 1998, studies have consistently used prolonged low-dose corticosteroid therapy, and analysis of this subgroup suggests a beneficial drug effect on short-term mortality.

### Global utilization of low-dose corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock: a report from the PROGRESS registry [^114SmBiv]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Debate regarding the utility of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock has continued over many years. Much of the debate has related to the characterization of the patient population that is most likely to benefit from treatment, optimum dose, and duration of treatment. Although it is now generally accepted that short courses of high-dose corticosteroids do not decrease mortality from severe sepsis and septic shock, longer courses of low-dose corticosteroids (LDC) have been shown to improve systemic hemodynamics and reduce the time on vasopressor treatment. Following the French multi-center study demonstrating that low-dose corticosteroids reduced mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency refractory to vasopressor treatment, the use of low-dose corticosteroids was incorporated into the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, recommending their use for patients with septic shock who require vasopressor treatment despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Importantly, they were not recommended for sepsis in the absence of shock. Subsequently, it is believed that the use of low-dose corticosteroids in clinical practice increased. Questions, however, were raised as to the applicability of these results to the wider intensive care unit (ICU) population as well as concerns as to the suitability of more widespread use of low-dose corticosteroids in severe sepsis. A retrospective case-control study from a single US site with 10,285 patients reported that 26% of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU were treated with steroids. After adjustment for baseline differences in disease severity and co-morbidities, these patients experienced a higher mortality and morbidity compared to controls that did not receive corticosteroids. The CORTICUS study of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock reported that low-dose corticosteroids treatment was not associated with a mortality reduction in the overall population or those with relative adrenal insufficiency (critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency). The overall mortality rate in the trial, however, was lower than in the French study. The differing results in the relative adrenal insufficiency subgroups between the French and CORTICUS studies resulted in new recommendations for steroid use in a more recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines consensus statement. The recommendations suggest use only in adult patients in septic shock who are poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, but again, not for patients with sepsis in the absence of shock. A meta-analysis of randomized trial results of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock suggested that the administration of low-dose corticosteroids for at least five days had a beneficial effect on short-term mortality. Other recent meta-analyses evaluating the effects of corticosteroids for the treatment of septic shock, found more heterogeneous effects on mortality, but suggested that low-dose corticosteroids significantly reduce the incidence of vasopressor-dependent shock and improve shock reversal. In contrast to the Annane et al. 2009 meta-analysis results, a recent observational study found no association between the administration of low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock and reduction of mortality, results echoed in a Bayesian analysis of pivotal trials in severe sepsis. Thus it can be seen that the potential benefits and use of low-dose corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. Although the use of low-dose corticosteroids for severe sepsis is suspected to be wide-spread, there is paucity of data regarding global practice.

Challenges in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock

Clinical strategies of sepsis are well-defined and outlined in the guideline regarding the management of sepsis and septic shock. Currently, implementation of a '1-hour bundle' is highly recommended, which encompasses key interventions within the first hour of recognizing potential sepsis in a patient with infection. This includes measuring serum lactate levels, obtaining blood cultures, and initiating broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Additionally, early hemodynamic stabilization is prioritized through fluid resuscitation, guided by serum lactate levels. In clinics, the priority besides diagnosis of sepsis is to achieve a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg with intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors (e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine).

As the approaches mentioned above do not address the dysregulated host response in patients with sepsis, additional immune- and anticoagulation-based therapeutic strategies have been proposed. For example, corticosteroids are widely applied in patients with septic shock as they potently suppress immune responses. Corticosteroids increase blood pressure and improve glomerular filtration rate; as such, the guideline of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests intravenous administration of hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg/day in adults with septic shock when adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy fail in restoring hemodynamic stability. However, corticosteroids should be considered with caution. While suppression of inflammation by hydrocortisone may be effective in controlling excessive inflammation, it will also dampen the immune response towards the underlying infection, allowing further spreading of pathogens. Probably for that reason, in a recent retrospective analysis of 31,749 patients with sepsis, we were unable to identify sub-population(s) ultimately benefiting from hydrocortisone use, and even reported associations between use of hydrocortisone and increased risk of death.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: consensus statements from an international task force by the American college of critical care medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

Participants

A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

Design/Methods

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

Results

The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents, particularly in the setting of sepsis. At this time, the diagnosis of tissue corticosteroid resistance remains problematic. Adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients is best made by a delta total serum cortisol of < 9 microg/dL after adrenocorticotrophic hormone (250 microg) administration or a random total cortisol of < 10 microg/dL. The benefit of treatment with glucocorticoids at this time seems to be limited to patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock and patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 of < 200 and within 14 days of onset). The adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test should not be used to identify those patients with septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome who should receive glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone in a dose of 200 mg/day in four divided doses or as a continuous infusion in a dose of 240 mg/day (10 mg/hr) for ≥ 7 days is recommended for septic shock. Methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for ≥ 14 days is recommended in patients with severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome. Glucocorticoids should be weaned and not stopped abruptly. Reinstitution of treatment should be considered with recurrence of signs of sepsis, hypotension, or worsening oxygenation. Dexamethasone is not recommended to treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. The role of glucocorticoids in the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, liver failure, pancreatitis, those undergoing cardiac surgery, and other groups of critically ill patients requires further investigation.

Conclusion

Evidence-linked consensus statements with regard to the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid deficiency in critically ill patients have been developed by a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force.

### Corticosteroids for septic shock [^114C52uk]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To gather the data to provide a rationale for using replacement therapy with hydrocortisone in septic shock patients.

Data Sources

The Medline and the Cochrane Library databases.

Study Selection

Studies in animals and in humans were considered when significant data were available about the mechanisms of action of corticosteroids or about their use in severe sepsis.

Data Summary

Corticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in septic patients. Randomized trials clearly showed that a short course of a large dose of anti-inflammatory steroids is ineffective and potentially harmful in patients with severe sepsis. Recent demonstrations of altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to septic insult have led to a reappraisal of the use of steroids in septic shock. Randomized trials in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients strongly suggest that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone may alleviate the symptoms of systemic inflammatory response, reduce the duration of shock, and favorably affect survival.

Conclusions

Current evidence that the therapeutic interest of replacement therapy with corticosteroids increases suggests that low doses of hydrocortisone should be offered to patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock.

### Corticosteroids for severe sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WQEad]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of corticosteroids on mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Data Sources

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroids versus placebo (or supportive treatment alone) retrieved from the Cochrane infectious diseases group's trials register, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline, Embase, and LILACS.

Review Method

Two pairs of reviewers agreed on eligibility of trials. One reviewer entered data on to the computer and four reviewers checked them. We obtained some missing data from authors of trials and assessed methodological quality of trials.

Results

16/23 trials (n = 2063) were selected. Corticosteroids did not change 28 day mortality (15 trials, n = 2022; relative risk 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.14) or hospital mortality (13 trials, n = 1418; 0.89, 0.71 to 1.11). There was significant heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis on long courses (≥ 5 days) with low dose (≤ 300 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent) corticosteroids showed no more heterogeneity. The relative risk for mortality was 0.80 at 28 days (five trials, n = 465; 0.67 to 0.95) and 0.83 at hospital discharge (five trials, n = 465, 0.71 to 0.97). Use of corticosteroids reduced mortality in intensive care units (four trials, n = 425, 0.83, 0.70 to 0.97), increased shock reversal at 7 days (four trials, n = 425; 1.60, 1.27 to 2.03) and 28 days (four trials, n = 425, 1.26, 1.04 to 1.52) without inducing side effects.

Conclusions

For all trials, regardless of duration of treatment and dose, use of corticosteroids did not significantly affect mortality. With long courses of low doses of corticosteroids, however, mortality at 28 days and hospital morality was reduced.

### Corticosteroids – A not-so-novel treatment for sepsis-associated AKI… [^111QdDap]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The ADRENAL trial enrolled 3800 participants with septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation who required vasopressors for at least 4 hours. The ADRENAL trial2 found that the administration of 200 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone daily for a median duration of 5. 5 days resulted in faster resolution of shock but no difference in mortality, days requiring mechanical ventilation, or the rate of KRT. This post hoc analysis reevaluates these data after excluding 639 participants who had withdrawn or received KRT prior to enrollment and adjusting for variables associated with KRT.

1. However, in the analysis excluding patients who commenced KRT within 2 days of randomization, this result was no longer statistically significant. There were no differences by group in the number of days alive and free from KRT or in the rate of liberation from KRT. Mechanistically, corticosteroids may reduce circulatory dysfunction on the causal pathway of septic shock to multiorgan dysfunction.

Sepsis-induced inflammation damages the vascular endothelial glycocalyx, increasing capillary permeability and vasodilation. 5 These changes manifest as hypotension, and cumulative exposure to hypotension is a well-known risk factor for AKI. 6 In the absence of hypotension, sepsis-induced redistribution of blood flow in the renal microcirculation may cause medullary hypoxia and kidney injury. 7 In the ADRENAL trial, participants in the hydrocortisone group had a higher MAP of 5 mm Hg and earlier resolution of shock. In clinical practice, the approach to adjunctive corticosteroid use in septic shock is often individualized. The pressor-sparing effect of corticosteroids may mitigate the adverse effects of vasopressors, such as digital ischemia and supraventricular tachycardia. However, vasopressors do not have known deleterious effects on the kidneys.

9 The risks of exacerbating sepsis-induced hyperglycemia, myopathy, and delirium may outweigh the benefits of corticosteroids in older patients or those with poor functional status. As many nephrologists who evaluate patients who are critically ill can tell you, our recommendations often center on avoidance: fluid overload, nephrotoxic medications, hypotension. The promise of treatment for sepsis-associated AKI is exciting, and corticosteroids deserve further investigation to elucidate the magnitude of their benefit on patient-centered outcomes. This will not only allow for individualized clinical decision-making but may pave the way for the investigation of immune-modulating therapy with fewer adverse effects.

### The international sepsis forum's controversies in sepsis: corticosteroids should not be routinely used to treat septic shock [^116TTLMg]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid treatment of severe sepsis has been one of the most controversial clinical issues in critical care. In fact, few agents can claim to have been evaluated in scores of studies spanning 3–4 decades. Yet, convincing proof that corticosteroids are useful pharmacologic agents in the treatment of this major clinical problem remains elusive. Recently, interest has resurfaced but this time the focus is on a steroid replacement approach for what has now been termed "relative adrenal insufficiency" rather than relying on the pharmacologic effects of steroids. This route holds promise, but proof remains lacking.

### Pro / con clinical debate: are steroids useful in the management of patients with septic shock? [^114NdTst]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Decision-making in the intensive care unit is often very difficult. Although we are encouraged to make evidence-based decisions, this may be difficult for a number of reasons. To begin with, evidence may not exist to answer the clinical question. Second, when there is evidence it may not be applicable to the patient in question or the clinician may be reluctant to apply it to the patient based on a number of secondary issues such as costs, premorbid condition or possible complications. Finally, emotions are often highly charged when caring for patients that have a significant chance of death, and care-givers as well as families are frequently prepared to take chances on a therapy whose benefit is not entirely clear. Steroid use in septic shock is an example of a therapy that makes some sense but has conflicting support in the literature. In this issue of Critical Care Forum, the two sides of this often heated debate are brought to the forefront in an interesting format.

### Corticosteroids for sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with dose-stratified and fludrocortisone subgroup evaluation [^115f18ae]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the role of fludrocortisone — a mineralocorticoid often used in combination with hydrocortisone — has received limited attention in previous syntheses. While some landmark trials included fludrocortisone, its independent or additive benefit relative to glucocorticoid monotherapy remains unclear. A stratified assessment of this factor may help clarify whether mineralocorticoid co-administration meaningfully improves outcomes.

A more granular understanding of how corticosteroid dose and type influence mortality could contribute to more tailored treatment strategies and better-informed clinical guidelines.

Consequently, we undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials published up to August 2025 to reevaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock, incorporating additional subgroup analyses based on dosage, the use of fludrocortisone, and geographic origin.

### Low-dose steroids in adult septic shock: results of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [^113LFyUh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) developed guidelines and treatment bundles for the administration of steroids in adult septic shock. However, it is not clear how this has affected clinical practice or patient outcome.

Design and Setting

The SSC has developed an extensive database to assess the overall effect of its guidelines on clinical practice and patient outcome. This analysis focuses on one particular element of the SSC's management bundle, namely, the administration of low-dose steroids in adult septic shock. This analysis was conducted on data submitted from January 2005 through March 2010 including 27,836 subjects at 218 sites.

Main Results

A total of 17,847 (of the total 27,836) patients in the database required vasopressor therapy despite fluid resuscitation and therefore met the eligibility criteria for receiving low-dose steroids. A total of 8,992 patients (50.4%) received low-dose steroids for their septic shock. Patients in Europe (59.4%) and South America (51.9%) were more likely to be prescribed low-dose steroids compared to their counterparts in North America (46.2%, p < 0.001). The adjusted hospital mortality was significantly higher (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09–1.23, p < 0.001) in patients who received low-dose steroids compared to those who did not. There was still an association with increased adjusted hospital mortality with low-dose steroids even if they were prescribed within 8 h (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13–1.34, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Steroids were commonly administered in the treatment of septic shock in this subset analysis of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign database. However, this was associated with an increase in adjusted hospital mortality.

### Updating the evidence for the role of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock: a Bayesian meta-analytic perspective [^116iRFAJ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was mortality assessment at hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were resolution of shock (or withdrawal of inotropes) at 7 to 28 days and corticotrophin responsiveness, secondary infections and non-infective (gastro-intestinal bleeding and new-onset hyperglycemia) complications.

Definitions

Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined after the 1992 American College of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. Pre-1992 studies were reviewed to establish consistency with this definition. Secondary infections were defined generally as a positive culture from a normally sterile site. The time span of the studies suggested that definitions for secondary infections would be subject to revision; for example, the use of quantitative cultures in more recent calendar years. Shock resolution was defined as a stable hemodynamic state for a period of 24 hours or more after weaning of vasopressor support. Corticosteroid dose was converted into hydrocortisone equivalents (mg) and expressed as total maximum realizable dose accounting for total time of exposure (therapeutic dose-time and tapering). Where patient corticosteroid dose-time schedule was unavailable due to death and/or reporting, we used median survival time from the published Kaplan-Meier curve.

### Controversies in corticosteroid use for sepsis [^1118YLCQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock are potentially deadly conditions managed in the emergency department (ED). Management centers on source control, fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and vasopressors as needed. The use of corticosteroids is controversial.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence behind corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock.

Discussion

Septic shock is associated with severe mortality and morbidity. Cytokine release produces a systemic inflammatory state. Vasopressor-resistant septic shock warrants consideration of the disease state and other pathologies such as adrenal insufficiency. Many studies and meta-analyses have been conducted evaluating corticosteroid therapy for this population. High-dose corticosteroid therapy is associated with increased harm, but physiologic-dose corticosteroids may decrease the need for vasopressors. Mortality benefit is controversial, with much of the literature demonstrating no effect. The risk of superinfection is not suggested by the majority of studies. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises consideration of corticosteroids in patients with vasopressor and fluid-resistant septic shock. Patients with vasopressor-resistant septic shock with no contraindications to corticosteroids may benefit from hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 8 h or 50 mg i.v. every 6 h. Fludrocortisone is not recommended at this time.

Conclusions

Septic shock is associated with higher mortality, specifically for patients with vasopressor and fluid-refractory shock. The use of physiologic-dose steroids can reduce vasopressor requirements and improve time of shock resolution. Current literature suggests corticosteroids do not improve mortality, but further studies are required.

### Low-dose corticosteroids for adult patients with septic shock: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^113xYeKF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effect of low dose corticosteroids on outcomes in adults with septic shock.

Methods

We systematically reviewed randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing low-dose corticosteroids to placebo in adults with septic shock. Trial selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. The primary outcome was short-term mortality. Secondary and tertiary outcomes included longer-term mortality, adverse events, quality of life, and duration of shock, mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

Results

There were 22 RCTs, including 7297 participants, providing data on short-term mortality. In two low risk of bias trials, the relative risk (RR) of short-term mortality with corticosteroid versus placebo was 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–1.08, p = 0.71]. Sensitivity analysis including all trials was similar (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.91–1.02, p = 0.21) as was analysis of longer-term mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90–1.02, p = 0.18). In low risk of bias trials, the risk of experiencing any adverse event was higher with corticosteroids; however, there was substantial heterogeneity (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.03–2.70, p = 0.04, I² = 78%). No trials reported quality of life outcomes. Duration of shock [mean difference (MD) -1.52 days; 95% CI -1.71 to -1.32, p < 0.0001], duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -1.38 days; 95% CI -1.96 to -0.80, p < 0.0001), and ICU stay (MD -0.75 days; 95% CI -1.34 to -0.17, p = 0.01) were shorter with corticosteroids versus placebo.

Conclusions

In adults with septic shock treated with low dose corticosteroids, short- and longer-term mortality are unaffected, adverse events increase, but duration of shock, mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are reduced. PROSPERO registration no. CRD42017084037.

### Corticosteroids for sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with dose-stratified and fludrocortisone subgroup evaluation [^113YqHR5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The therapeutic benefit of corticosteroids in managing sepsis and septic shock remains controversial, particularly concerning optimal dosing strategies and the role of adjunctive fludrocortisone. Recent large-scale trials and updated guidelines underscore the need for a dose-stratified synthesis. This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of corticosteroids on short-term mortality in sepsis, with subgroup analyses by steroid type, dosage, and geographic region.

Methods

This study followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing corticosteroids with placebo in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock were included. Subgroup analyses were pre-specified for daily hydrocortisone-equivalent dose (≤ 200 mg, 201–300 mg, > 300 mg), steroid type (hydrocortisone alone vs. hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone), and region (China vs. non-China). Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were synthesized using a random-effects model.

Results

Eighteen RCTs comprising 7,982 patients were included. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with reduced 28-day mortality (RR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79–0.98; I² = 39%). The 28-day mortality was 31.0% in the corticosteroid group versus 35.5% in the control group. The most pronounced benefit was seen with 201–300 mg/day regimens (RR = 0.86; I² = 0%) and with combination therapy including fludrocortisone (RR = 0.89). Regional analysis showed weaker effects in trials conducted in China.

Conclusion

Moderate-dose corticosteroids, especially when used in conjunction with fludrocortisone, significantly reduce short-term mortality in septic shock. Findings support guideline-endorsed steroid use and highlight the importance of individualized treatment strategies.

### Monotherapy or combination therapy for septic shock? A debate on steroids [^111QKvc6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, the findings of this meta-analysis are anticipated to spark significant debate. Some clinicians may view the findings as robust enough to start considering a combination of corticosteroids while managing adult patients with septic shock. Others may remain skeptical. No matter their clinical stand, one may keep in mind that sepsis is a heterogenous syndrome encompassing several subphenotypes that may respond differently to corticosteroids. Current precision medicine research efforts may endeavor to distinguish, among patients with septic shock, those who will be harmed by any corticosteroid regimen, those who will derive benefit from hydrocortisone alone, and those who will derive survival benefit from the combination of fludrocortisone plus hydrocortisone.

### Updating the evidence for the role of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock: a Bayesian meta-analytic perspective [^113iyqjH]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current low (stress) dose corticosteroid regimens may have therapeutic advantage in severe sepsis and septic shock despite conflicting results from two landmark randomised controlled trials (RCT). We systematically reviewed the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

RCTs were identified (1950-September 2008) by multiple data-base electronic search (MEDLINE via OVID, OVID PreMedline, OVID Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Health Technology Assessment Database and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) and hand search of references, reviews and scientific society proceedings. Three investigators independently assessed trial inclusion and data extraction into standardised forms; differences resolved by consensus.

Results

Corticosteroid efficacy, compared with control, for hospital-mortality, proportion of patients experiencing shock-resolution, and infective and non-infective complications was assessed using Bayesian random-effects models; expressed as odds ratio (OR, (95% credible-interval)). Bayesian outcome probabilities were calculated as the probability (P) that OR ≥ 1. Fourteen RCTs were identified. High-dose (> 1000 mg hydrocortisone (equivalent) per day) corticosteroid trials were associated with a null (n = 5; OR 0.91(0.31–1.25)) or higher (n = 4, OR 1.46(0.73–2.16), outlier excluded) mortality probability (P = 42.0% and 89.3%, respectively). Low-dose trials (< 1000 mg hydrocortisone per day) were associated with a lower (n = 9, OR 0.80(0.40–1.39); n = 8 OR 0.71(0.37–1.10), outlier excluded) mortality probability (20.4% and 5.8%, respectively). OR for shock-resolution was increased in the low dose trials (n = 7; OR 1.20(1.07–4.55); P = 98.2%). Patient responsiveness to corticotrophin stimulation was non-determinant. A high probability of risk-related treatment efficacy (decrease in log-odds mortality with increased control arm risk) was identified by metaregression in the low dose trials (n = 9, slope coefficient -0.49(-1.14, 0.27); P = 92.2%). Odds of complications were not increased with corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Although a null effect for mortality treatment efficacy of low dose corticosteroid therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock was not excluded, there remained a high probability of treatment efficacy, more so with outlier exclusion. Similarly, although a null effect was not excluded, advantageous effects of low dose steroids had a high probability of dependence upon patient underlying risk. Low dose steroid efficacy was not demonstrated in corticotrophin non-responders. Further large-scale trials appear mandated.

### Smarter use of corticosteroids in treating patients with septic shock… [^114W8FHM]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Since the 2016 guidelines, 2 large randomized trials of adjunctive hydrocortisone in septic shock have been published. The APROCCHSS trial2 enrolled 1241 patients with septic shock requiring high-dose vasopressors for at least 6 hours. Patients randomized to hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone had lower 90-day mortality. 2 Meanwhile, the ADRENAL trial3 enrolled 3658 patients with septic shock receiving any vasopressors for at least 4 hours. Patients randomized to hydrocortisone infusion had similar 90-day mortality as the placebo group, but spent fewer days on mechanical ventilation and had faster resolution of shock.
3. Because of the inconsistent mortality benefit across trials, intensivists have mixed opinions regarding the utility of corticosteroids in septic shock. Proponents of corticosteroids argue that they consistently improve nonmortality outcomes.

They result in faster shock resolution, shorter intensive care unit stays, and fewer days on the ventilator — outcomes of heightened importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, proponents may opt to prescribe hydrocortisone to all patients with septic shock meeting trial inclusions. Meanwhile, skeptics of corticosteroids argue that less is more — and absent a clear mortality benefit, we shouldn't subject our patients to additional therapies. Corticosteroids have a multitude of side effects that may be incompletely measured in clinical trials. For this reason, skeptics may opt to prescribe hydrocortisone to few or no patients with septic shock. The authors used 2 different approaches to estimating patients' individual benefit from corticosteroids.

First, they estimated individual benefit according to the pooled relative risk reduction of corticosteroids and each patient's personalized risk of mortality based on their severity of critical illness. Across all scenarios with plausible risk tolerance, the individualized approaches were associated with greater benefit, and the machine learning approach consistently outperformed the risk-based approach to estimating individual benefit. Interestingly, the machine learning model estimated that the maximal benefit occurred when treating 20% of patients with corticosteroids — far lower than would receive corticosteroids in a treat-all approach.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^111VDVa3]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to evaluate the association between early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy and decreased mortality in patients with septic shock. The results of our retrospective cohort study indicate that early administration of low-dose corticosteroid is independently associated with better outcome in patients with septic shock. Additionally, we found that early low-dose corticosteroid therapy within 6 hours from the initial onset of septic shock-related hypotension reduced the relative risk of 28-day mortality by 37% compared with late therapy after 6 hours.

All patients with septic shock in our study received low-dose corticosteroid therapy as a standard treatment protocol. However, time to initiation of this therapy depended on the decision of the primary physician. Therefore, we were able to analyze the association between the time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy and outcomes. Our findings could partially explain the different results of two large multicenter, randomized, controlled studies of low-dose corticosteroid therapy, which used different time windows of enrollment. In the study by Annane et al. in which low-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated within eight hours after the onset of septic shock, a survival benefit was seen in patients with no response to corticotropin. In that study, mean time from initiation of vasopressor to study drug therapy was about four hours. In contrast, because this time window was subsequently increased to 72 hours after the onset of septic shock in the CORTICUS study, the benefit of this therapy was not shown. Although 77% of enrolled patients were started on the study treatment within 12 hours after the onset of septic shock in the CORTICUS study, there were no significant differences in outcome in this subgroup. In the present study, the median time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was 8.5 hours after the onset of septic shock, and early administration of low-dose corticosteroid was independently associated with decreased mortality even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including severity of illness, which was another important difference between the two previous large studies. Specifically, when the outcomes were compared between patients treated within six hours after development of septic shock and those treated later, baseline characteristics including severity of illness were not different, but a better outcome was observed in patients receiving low-dose corticosteroid therapy within six hours.

### Systemic steroids in severe sepsis and septic shock [^114d5wuV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Despite more than 5 decades of study and debate, the role of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. Data support a beneficial effect on systemic blood pressure in patients with septic shock. However, the ability of corticosteroid therapy to improve mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial, with contradictory results from recent large multicenter clinical trials. Although it appears clear that high-dose corticosteroid treatment provides no benefit and possibly harm in septic patients, the experimental design flaws and biases of recent low-dose (physiologic) steroid treatment trials limit their ability to provide adequate answers to the important questions of which septic patients should be treated, how much steroid to give, and the optimum duration of treatment. Unfortunately, the answer to these important questions is not readily evident based on the current evidence or the application of metaanalysis to the available clinical data. This concise evidence-based review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the current data to inform the practicing clinician as to which patients are likely to derive significant benefit from corticosteroid treatment, while we await more definitive guidance from future multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trials designed to better answer these important therapeutic questions.

### Corticosteroids in sepsis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111X8EoZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis.

Data Sources

We updated a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and LILACS, and unpublished sources for randomized controlled trials that compared any corticosteroid to placebo or no corticosteroid in critically ill children and adults with sepsis.

Study Selection

Reviewers conducted duplicate screening of citations, data abstraction, and, using a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool, individual study risk of bias assessment.

Data Extraction

A parallel guideline committee provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. We assessed overall certainty in evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and performed all analyses using random-effect models. For subgroup analyses, we performed metaregression and considered p value less than 0.05 as significant.

Data Synthesis

Forty-two randomized controlled trials including 10,194 patients proved eligible. Based on low certainty, corticosteroids may achieve a small reduction or no reduction in the relative risk of dying in the short-term (28–31 d) (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.03; 1.8% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1% reduction to 0.8% increase), and possibly achieve a small effect on long-term mortality (60 d to 1 yr) based on moderate certainty (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00; 2.2% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1% reduction to no effect). Corticosteroids probably result in small reductions in length of stay in ICU (mean difference, -0.73 d; 95% CI, -1.78 to 0.31) and hospital (mean difference, -0.73 d; 95% CI, -2.06 to 0.60) (moderate certainty). Corticosteroids result in higher rates of shock reversal at day 7 (relative risk, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12–1.42) and lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores at day 7 (mean difference, -1.39; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.89) (high certainty). Corticosteroids likely increase the risk of hypernatremia (relative risk, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.32–2.03) and hyperglycemia (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08–1.24) (moderate certainty), may increase the risk of neuromuscular weakness (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01–1.52) (low certainty), and appear to have no other adverse effects (low or very low certainty). Subgroup analysis did not demonstrate a credible subgroup effect on any of the outcomes of interest (p > 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients with sepsis, corticosteroids possibly result in a small reduction in mortality while also possibly increasing the risk of neuromuscular weakness.

### Corticosteroids in pediatric shock: a call to arms [^113Eb24v]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the issues needing to be resolved to design, implement, and complete a definitive randomized controlled trial of adjunctive corticosteroid use in children with septic shock.

Design

Pediatric studies from MEDLINE (1946 to January 2015) and Embase (1947 to January 2015) that addressed adrenal function or steroid use in critically ill children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock were reviewed and their relevant points discussed.

Results

There is considerable interest in the field of corticosteroids in pediatric septic shock, which has not as yet translated into a much needed randomized controlled trial. We found that the issues that need to be resolved include identification of the target population, achievement of individual and community equipoise, selection of a patient centered, clinically meaningful primary outcome measure, and consideration of the adverse effects of corticosteroids.

Conclusions

We strongly believe that the time has come to conduct a trial on the use of corticosteroids in pediatric septic shock and that the question to be answered is Will corticosteroids given to children with septic shock result in a benefit to some patients without resulting in harm to others? Answering this question will require a collaborative and committed effort on the parts of ethics boards, families, clinicians, and researchers to actually make it happen once and for all, and we propose an international planning meeting of interested parties to achieve agreement on these identified issues.

### Steroids for septic shock: back from the dead? (con) [^116eGfET]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The role of corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock has been debated for half a century. Results from large, well-designed, randomized clinical trials demonstrate no benefit, and perhaps harm, associated with short duration, high-dose methylprednisolone or dexamethasone administered at the onset of septic shock. Based on evidence of "relative adrenal insufficiency" and steroid-responsive adrenergic receptor desensitization in sepsis, administration of modest doses (200 to 300 mg/d) of hydrocortisone for 1 to 3 weeks has been investigated. A multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated improved survival rates and faster cessation of vasopressors among patients with septic shock who have a poor response to corticotropin injection, consistent with relative adrenal insufficiency. However, concerns regarding a trend for higher mortality among corticotropin responders and the possibility that patients with true adrenal insufficiency may have been enrolled in this placebo-controlled trial, potentially skewing results, should be considered.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^113DYSmb]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of low-dose steroid therapy in the management of septic shock has been extensively studied. However, the association between the timing of low-dose steroid therapy and the outcome has not been evaluated. Therefore, we evaluated whether early initiation of low-dose steroid therapy is associated with mortality in patients with septic shock.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 178 patients who received low-dose corticosteroid therapy for septic shock between January 2008 and December 2009. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors in the association between the time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy and in-hospital mortality.

Results

The study population consisted of 107 men and 71 women with a median age of 66 (interquartile range, 54 to 71) years. The 28-day mortality was 44% and low-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated within a median of 8.5 (3.8 to 19.1) hours after onset of septic shock-related hypotension. Median time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was significantly shorter in survivors than in non-survivors (6.5 hours versus 10.4 hours; P = 0.0135). The mortality rates increased significantly with increasing quintiles of time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.0107 for trend). Other factors associated with 28-day mortality were higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 (P < 0.0001) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (P = 0.0007), dose of vasopressor at the time of initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy (P < 0.0001), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.0001) and renal replacement therapy (P < 0.0001), while the impaired adrenal reserve did not affect 28-day mortality (81% versus 82%; P = 0.8679). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was still significantly associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.025, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007 to 1.044, P = 0.0075). The early therapy group (administered within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, n = 66) had a 37% lower mortality rate than the late therapy group (administered more than 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, n = 112) (32% versus 51%, P = 0.0132).

Conclusions

Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was significantly associated with decreased mortality.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^116Ya8EX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence.

In this section, we specifically focus on the role of corticosteroids in patients with refractory septic shock who require vasopressors. We will not consider the role of corticosteroids for treatment of respiratory failure, ARDS, and pneumonia aspects of COVID-19, which has been evaluated in various studies to date.–

In HIC settings, a 2019 systematic review of 37 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 9,564) comparing corticosteroid therapy versus placebo or no therapy in patients with septic shock demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome of 28-day mortality (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82–0.98). Corticosteroid treatment was associated with a faster time to shock reversal (mean difference −1.35 days, 95% CI: −1.78 to −0.91), a decrease in ICU length of stay (mean difference −1.16 days, 95% CI: −2.12 to −0.20), and an increase in vasopressor-free days (mean difference 1.95 days, 95% CI: 0.80–3.11). There was no difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, superinfection, or any other severe adverse outcome between groups, although there was an increased risk of biochemical derangements such as hyperglycemia and hypernatremia. A Cochrane systematic review of 61 RCTs comparing corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care in 12,192 children and adults with sepsis also found a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84–0.99) and large reductions in ICU and hospital lengths of stay. Although none of these trials were specifically performed among COVID-19 patients, we believe it is reasonable to extend these findings to COVID-19 patients. Also, although no studies have specifically studied hydrocortisone or other steroids in COVID-19, it is reasonable to believe that if a patient is getting hydrocortisone or other equivalent steroid for refractory shock, then adding dexamethasone to the regimen is not needed.

We found no RCTs in LMICs. A 2011 prospective cohort study (n = 1,285) evaluating the compliance of ICUs in 16 Asian countries with an early iteration of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation and management bundles indicated that corticosteroids were administered more frequently in non-survivors but were not associated with a mortality difference in a multivariable analysis.

### The role of glucocorticoids as adjunctive treatment for sepsis in the modern era [^113pHL7z]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids have been used as adjunctive therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock for more than four decades. The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids is that this class of drugs downregulates the proinflammatory response and limits the anti-inflammatory response while preserving innate immunity. Between 1976 and 2017, 22 randomised placebo-controlled trials have been published evaluating the benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock. These studies produced conflicting results. In 2018, two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were published evaluating the role of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. The Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial reported a reduction in 90-day mortality whereas the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial reported no mortality benefit. This Viewpoint critically appraises these two RCTs and evaluates the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock in the modern era.

### Use of corticosteroid therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock: an evidence-based review [^111DnfzD]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for the use of corticosteroid therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built upon a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusions

Low doses of corticosteroids are recommended in patients with septic shock. In the absence of vasopressor requirement, corticosteroids should not be used to treat sepsis. High-dose corticosteroids are not recommended in severe sepsis. The use of adrenal function tests to guide decisions on corticosteroid therapy, the weaning of steroids at the end of the treatment period, the decision to discontinue steroids earlier with resolution of shock, and the addition of oral fludrocortisone are considered optional approaches.

### Corticosteroids for sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with dose-stratified and fludrocortisone subgroup evaluation [^112dPbBj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis and septic shock continue to be significant causes of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients globally. Despite advancements in antimicrobial therapies and supportive care, mortality rates for septic shock remain above 30% in numerous regions. International guidelines (e.g. SSC 2021) now weakly recommend low-dose hydrocortisone for vasopressor-dependent septic shock (SSC, 2021) Among the various immunomodulatory approaches, corticosteroids have been advocated for their potential to modulate the dysregulated host response in sepsis, especially in patients experiencing refractory shock.

Historically, the use of corticosteroids in sepsis has been contentious. Earlier trials yielded inconsistent results, and meta-analyses conducted prior to 2019 revealed considerable heterogeneity in both trial design and outcomes. Since 2020, several new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and subgroup-focused analyses have further complicated the existing body of evidence. For example, a recent multicenter patient-level meta-analysis conducted by Pirracchio et al. (2023) and published in NEJM Evidence (a NEJM Group journal) demonstrated the potential advantages of combining hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone. These findings underscore the need for an updated and comprehensive synthesis of the current body of evidence.

The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock, and for ARDS was unable to provide specific recommendations regarding corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy based on currently available evidence. New evidence was "warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline", and a 22-member panel developed evidence-based recommendations for hospitalized adults and children.

### Steroids for septic shock: back from the dead? (pro) [^112ZrKyF]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for severe sepsis and septic shock has been a source of controversy for the past 35 years. Despite a wealth of preclinical data supporting both survival and physiologic benefit for early steroid use, the data in human sepsis have been much less convincing. There have even been reports suggesting the potential for harm associated with the administration of early high-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Recent trials have reported hemodynamic and survival benefits associated with the use of more physiologic steroid replacement therapy in patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock. These results coupled with the observation of "relative adrenal insufficiency" in some patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may once again establish a defined role for corticosteroid therapy in the management of severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy attenuates septic shock in adult patients but does not reduce 28-day mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112iAxfZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The role of low-dose hydrocortisone in attenuating septic shock and reducing short-term mortality in adult patients with septic shock is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of previous studies to determine whether hydrocortisone could ameliorate the effects of septic shock at 7 and 28 days and reduce 28-day morality.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo (or supportive treatment alone) were retrieved from electronic searches (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases; LILACS; and Web of Knowledge) and manual searches (up to May 2012). From a pool of 1949 potentially relevant articles, duplicate independent review identified 10 relevant, RCTs of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy in septic shock. Four pairs of reviewers agreed on the criteria for trial eligibility. One reviewer entered the data into the computer, and 3 reviewers checked the data. Missing data were obtained from the authors of the relevant trials. The primary outcome analyzed was an estimate of 28-day mortality.

Results

Eight publications were included in the meta-analysis. Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy did not reduce 28-day mortality (N = 1063; odds ratio (OR) = 0.891, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69–1.15). Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy ameliorated shock at 7 days (6 RCTs, N = 964, OR = 2.078, 95% CI, 1.58–2.73, P < 0.0001, and I = 26.9%) and 28 days (6 RCTs, N = 947, OR = 1.495, 95% CI, 1.12–1.99, P = 0.006, and I = 0.0%).

Conclusions

Although low-dose hydrocortisone therapy ameliorates septic shock at 7 and 28 days, it does not reduce 28-day mortality.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: a clinical practice guideline [^113LjRZa]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Surrogate outcomes such as time to shock reversal, organ dysfunction measured by the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, hyperglycaemia, and hypernatraemia were less important to the panel. This view is consistent with GRADE recommendations to focus on patient-important outcomes rather than surrogates.

Subgroups of interest — The panel wanted to know whether the effect of corticosteroids differed in people with sepsis, compared with people who had septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or were at higher risk of death. They also wanted to know whether the type of corticosteroid or its dose influenced outcomes.

The panel met by videoconference to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. No panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

The panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials on the impact of corticosteroid therapy for patients who have sepsis, including those who have septic shock. This review examines the two latest, as well as previous studies, on corticosteroids in sepsis. The aim was to resolve apparently conflicting evidence.

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 3 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of corticosteroids, the quality of the evidence for each outcome, expected variations in patient values and preferences, and acceptability of corticosteroids. Determining patient values and preferences occurred before the panel received the results of the meta-analysis to reduce the risk that opinions regarding outcome importance will be data driven. According to the GRADE approach, recommendations can be strong or weak and for or against a course of action. High quality evidence of an effect on surrogate outcomes do not trigger strong recommendations.

### The effects of steroids during sepsis depend on dose and severity of illness: an updated meta-analysis [^1164VANt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

A previous meta-analysis determined that the effects of steroids during sepsis were dose-dependent; since then, additional trials have been published. The current analysis updates our previous analysis examining the effects of steroids during sepsis. A literature search from 2004 to 2008 identified seven randomized controlled trials in adult patients; these were added to 14 previously identified trials. The effects of steroids on mortality were highly variable among the 21 trials (p < 0.001, I(2) = 60%). In trials published before 1989, which involved short courses of high-dose steroids, steroids increased mortality (n = 8, I(2) = 14%, OR of death 1.39 (95% CI 1.04–1.86), p 0.03). In trials published after 1997, which involved longer courses of lower-dose steroids, steroids consistently improved shock reversal (n = 7, I(2) = 0%, OR of shock reversal 1.66 [95% CI 1.25–2.20), p < 0.001), but demonstrated a more heterogeneous beneficial effect on mortality (n = 12, I(2) = 25%, OR of death 0.64 (95% CI 0.45–0.93), p 0.02). An inverse linear relationship between severity of illness and the effects of steroids on mortality was identified across all trials (p 0.03) and within the subgroup of trials published after 1997 (p 0.03); steroids were harmful in less severely ill patient populations and beneficial in more severely ill patient populations. There was no effect of response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation testing concerning the effects of steroids and no increase in steroid-associated adverse events. Low-dose steroids appear to improve mortality rates in patients with septic shock who are at high risk of death; however, additional trials in this subpopulation are necessary to definitively determine the role of low-dose steroids during sepsis.

### Meta-analysis: the effect of steroids on survival and shock during sepsis depends on the dose [^111XkAu5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses demonstrated that high-dose glucocorticoids were not beneficial in sepsis. Recently, lower-dose glucocorticoids have been studied.

Purpose

To compare recent trials of glucocorticoids for sepsis with previous glucocorticoid trials.

Data Sources

Systematic MEDLINE search for studies published between 1988 and 2003.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of sepsis that examined the effects of glucocorticoids on survival or vasopressor requirements.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently collected data on patient and study characteristics, treatment interventions, and outcomes.

Data Synthesis

The 5 included trials revealed a consistent and beneficial effect of glucocorticoids on survival (I2 = 0%; relative benefit, 1.23, [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.50]; P = 0.036) and shock reversal (I2 = 0%; relative benefit, 1.71 [CI, 1.29 to 2.26]; P < 0.001). These effects were the same regardless of adrenal function. In contrast, 8 trials published before 1989 demonstrated a survival disadvantage with steroid treatment (I2 = 14%; relative benefit, 0.89 [CI, 0.82 to 0.97]; P = 0.008). In comparison with the earlier trials, the more recent trials administered steroids later after patients met enrollment criteria (median, 23 hours vs. < 2 hours; P = 0.02), for longer courses (6 days vs. 1 day; P = 0.01), and in lower total dosages (hydrocortisone equivalents, 1209 mg vs. 23 975 mg; P = 0.01) to patients with higher control group mortality rates (mean, 57% vs. 34%; P = 0.06) who were more likely to be vasopressor-dependent (100% vs. 65%; P = 0.03). The relationship between steroid dose and survival was linear, characterized by benefit at low doses and increasing harm at higher doses (P = 0.02).

Limitations

We could not analyze time-related improvements in medical care and potential bias secondary to nonreporting of negative study results.

Conclusions

Although short courses of high-dose glucocorticoids decreased survival during sepsis, a 5- to 7-day course of physiologic hydrocortisone doses with subsequent tapering increases survival rate and shock reversal in patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^111MmHhr]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Several reports provided additional evidence of the importance of timely intervention in the management of septic shock. Rivers et al. reported that early hemodynamic resuscitation (EGDT) for severe sepsis and septic shock within six hours resulted in improved survival compared with less prompt resuscitation treatment. Kumar et al. showed that from the onset of hypotension in patients with septic shock, each hour of delay in antibiotic therapy over the ensuing six hours was associated with an increase in mortality. In the present study, initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy more than six hours after the onset of septic shock was independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for potential confounding factors.

To fully appreciate these results, the limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, given its retrospective nature, there is always the possibility that selection bias may have influenced the significance of our findings. Previous observational studies reported that patients treated with low-dose corticosteroids are more severely ill. Therefore, more severely ill patients might receive delayed initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy compared to patients who received early therapy in this study. However, baseline severity or number of organ failures at the time of initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy was not different between the early treatment group and the late treatment group. In addition, adjusted multivariate analysis, and the protocolization of initial resuscitation and management for severe sepsis and septic shock before the initiation of this study served to minimize the potential for selection bias. However, the potential for a bias of unmeasured confounder remains. Second, the data on initial resuscitation could not be extracted due to incomplete medical records. Compliance with initial resuscitation bundles and achievement of end points may be important confounding factors in the association between time to initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy and mortality. Other data of our EAST program on the initial resuscitation for severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department for one year (from August, 2008 to July, 2009) noted that compliance of resuscitation bundle was 50% (unpublished data). However, it is not clear how compliance with EGDT and achievement of end points would affect this association. Furthermore, there are potential barriers to the effective implementation of EGDT at the patient, clinician, and organizational level. Therefore, our results represent actual practice at a tertiary referral hospital. Third, the reason for delayed initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy could not be evaluated.

### Early initiation of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock: a retrospective observational study [^1162mGxN]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory effects and were the first drugs tested in large randomized controlled trials in septic patients. However, these studies indicated that a short course of high-dose corticosteroid in early stages of septic shock had no effect on outcome or was even harmful, probably because of immunosuppression and increased incidence of secondary infections. Only one study showed an initial improvement in survival and shock reversal with high-dose corticosteroid, but with ongoing disease, the difference was no longer significant. Recently, the observation that severe sepsis and septic shock may be associated with absolute or relative adrenal insufficiency and steroid receptor resistance prompted renewed interest in steroid treatment in septic patients. A novel approach of low-dose corticosteroid was found to have beneficial effects on hemodynamics and outcome. These effects have mainly been attributed to sensitization of the vasculature to vasopressor. However, there is other evidence that this low-dose corticosteroid therapy affects the immune response. Briegel et al. reported that low-dose corticosteroid therapy was associated with significant reductions in proinflammatory cytokine levels and with early resolution of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Keh et al. also demonstrated that low-dose corticosteroid therapy inhibited systemic inflammation and prevented overwhelming compensatory anti-inflammatory responses. Moreover, in a recent randomized controlled study, Oppert et al. found that the anti-inflammatory effects of low-dose corticosteroid were independent of adrenal function. Therefore, if the benefits of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in the management of septic shock are not limited to hemodynamic improvement in patients with impaired adrenal functions but are also related to anti-inflammatory effects, timely initiation of this treatment would be important. Unfortunately, our study has no data related to the anti-inflammatory effects of low-dose corticosteroid therapy.

### The controversial role of corticosteroids in septic shock [^117NcjUw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Several clinical trials and literature reviews have been conducted to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids on the physiological markers and clinical outcomes of patients in septic shock. While the findings have been somewhat contradictory, there is evidence of moderate benefit from the administration of low-dose corticosteroids to patients in septic shock. In this review, we discuss recent studies evaluating the impact of corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality in septic shock and explore future directions to fully elucidate when and how the administration of corticosteroid therapies can be beneficial.

Methods

A literature review was performed using the Mesh database of PubMed with the term "septic shock" and subheadings "therapeutic use", "drug therapy", "pharmacology", and "therapy" followed by the addition of "steroid". Filters were added to restrict the search to 18+ age, English and human studies, and articles published within the last 10 years. One hundred sixty-five articles were examined and twenty-five were deemed relevant to this review.

Results

The twenty-five articles reviewed here provide conflicting evidence as to the usefulness of corticosteroid treatments during septic shock. Several showed improved physiological outcomes, including rates of organ failure, need for life supporting interventions, adverse effects, inflammatory markers, and perfusion during the course of septic shock, as well as decreased mortality for a statistically significant number of patients.

Conclusions

There remains a need for improved therapy for patients in septic shock. Corticosteroids have shown some potential in improving mortality rates and clinical markers. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal role of corticosteroids in septic shock.

Key messages

- The efficacy of corticosteroids in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock is uncertain despite recent meta-analytic reviews.

- Bayesian methods are apposite to express uncertainty in efficacy estimates from meta-analyses.

- The efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids had a high probability of dependence upon patient age and underlying risk; low-dose steroid efficacy was not demonstrated in corticotrophin non-responders.

- Bayesian meta-analytic predictive estimates were unable to suggest efficacy for future large trials.

- A null effect for mortality treatment efficacy of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock could not be excluded.

### Updating the evidence for the role of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock: a Bayesian meta-analytic perspective [^114xhXej]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 1974, Weitzman and Berger reviewed the clinical trial design of studies reporting corticosteroid use in bacterial infections over the previous 20 years because of the controversial role of the therapeutic use of corticosteroids in acute infections. It is ironic that 34 years later a similar sentiment was echoed: "For more than five decades, no other adjunctive therapy has been more consistently debated than the use of corticosteroids for severe sepsis and septic shock". A contemporaneous review concluded that the role of glucocorticoid therapy in intensive care remained uncertain. In 1995, two meta-analyses found no benefit for high-(pharmacological)-dose corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock and in 2004 another two meta-analyses found benefit for long courses of low-(stress) -dose corticosteroids. This benefit was either qualified: pending the results of the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock (CORTICUS) study, clinical equipoise remained for the issues of adreno-corticotrophin (ACTH) administration, cortisol testing, and the therapeutic use of hydrocortisone; or more definitive: '.a beneficial therapy to critically ill patients in septic shock'. That the confirmatory phase III CORTICUS study was 'somewhat disappointing' undoubtedly reflects this history of therapeutic uncertainty. Current guidelines advocate a role for intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients who are poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy and, in the apparent absence of a mortality effect dependent on ACTH responsiveness, attention has been directed to the more rapid time-resolution of shock with corticosteroids.

Thus the question still remains: what is the evidence, post CORTICUS, for the efficacy of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock? We undertook a systematic review and quantitative analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) addressing corticosteroid efficacy in severe sepsis and septic shock, updating previous studies. As the question of further large-scale trials to assess corticosteroids in septic shock has currently been canvassed, in particular the efficacy at high mortality risk, we addressed the risk-related efficacy of steroids within the trials considered and estimated the predictive distribution for the underlying effect in new studies.

Corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock — evidence summary reports that a total of 46 randomized controlled trials compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in sepsis or septic shock, with populations spanning sepsis (seven trials), CAP and sepsis (five), ARDS and sepsis (four), and the remainder septic shock; six trials examined pediatric patients, one included both adults and children, and the remainder included only adults. Corticosteroid use may reduce hospital/long-term mortality (from 60 d to 1 yr) (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00, low certainty) and probably reduces ICU/short-term mortality (14–30 d) (RR 0.93; 95% Cl, 0.88–0.98, moderate certainty) in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and subgroup analysis based on corticosteroid type, duration, or dosage did not demonstrate any credible subgroup effects.

### Corticosteroids for treating severe sepsis and septic shock [^111vVJMa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid production. Giving corticosteroids could potentially benefit patients.

Objectives

To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trial register (August 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (August 2003), EMBASE (August 2003), LILACS (August 2003), reference lists of articles, and also contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of reviewers agreed the eligibility of trials. One reviewer extracted data, which was checked by the other reviewers and the primary author of the paper whenever possible. We obtained some missing data from the trial authors. We assessed trial methodological quality.

Main Results

We identified 15 trials (n = 2023). Corticosteroids did not change 28-day all-cause mortality (15 trials, n = 2022, relative risk (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.14; random effects model) and hospital mortality (13 trials, n = 1418, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; random effects model); however, there was statistically significant heterogeneity, with some evidence that this was related to the dosing strategy. Corticosteroids reduced intensive care unit mortality (4 trials, n = 425, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97), increased the proportion of shock reversal by day 7 (6 trials, n = 728, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40) and by day 28 (4 trials, n = 425, RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.52), without increasing the rate of gastroduodenal bleeding (10 trials, n = 1321, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.65), superinfection (12 trials, n = 1705, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18), and of hyperglycaemia (6 trials, n = 608, RR 1.22, 0.84 to 1.78).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Overall, corticosteroids did not change 28-day mortality and hospital mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock. Long course of low dose corticosteroids reduced 28-day all-cause mortality, and intensive care unit and hospital mortality.

Materials and methods

Trial selection

Randomised controlled trials in critically ill patients evaluating corticosteroid therapy versus no corticosteroid therapy in severe sepsis or septic shock were considered for inclusion. Only trials reporting mortality were included. We excluded: studies reporting only physiological endpoints (for example, changes in immunological variables); descriptive studies; retrospective cohort studies; studies in the pediatric population; and studies exclusively reporting series of meningitis, typhoid fever and pneumonia where sub-set analyses of patients of interest (for this meta-analysis) were not reported. Where there was missing data or ambiguity of data presentation, attempts were made to contact the study author(s) to resolve these issues.

Search strategy and quality assessment

An extensive computerized literature search was performed (SR) for the period of 1950 to September 2008 using the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE via OVID, OVID PreMedline, EBSCO Cinahl, OVID Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, American College of Physicians Journal Club, Health Technology Assessment Database and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We restricted the search to studies on adult human populations and used the Mesh, Embase and Cinahl thesaurus in addition to free text searching. The following terms were identified as the most relevant: sepsis or bacteremia or fungemia or pneumonia or septicemia or septic shock narrowed down with the terms hydrocortisone or corticosteroids or adrenal cortex hormones or steroids. The set was then further limited to randomised controlled trials or clinical trials or multicenter study and trials published in English. A detailed search strategy is provided in Additional file 1.

We reviewed the abstracts of trials generated by the electronic search and the full text of trials pertaining to corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock were retrieved for a more detailed evaluation. Review articles were examined to identify additional trials. In addition a hand search of the proceedings of scientific meetings of the following journals was performed: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chest, Critical Care Medicine, European Respiratory Journal, Intensive Care Medicine and Thorax.

Quality assessment

Three investigators (JLM, PLG, and AB) reviewed studies fulfilling inclusion criteria and pre-defined variables and outcomes were abstracted into standardized data abstraction forms. Quality assessment on the published studies was performed in an un-blinded fashion by two investigators (JLM, PLG) using the 11-point quality score of Cronin and colleagues. Where there were differences in scoring, a consensus was reached. Extracted data was separately entered, reviewed and verified by two investigators (JLM, PLG) prior to analysis.

### Corticosteroids in septic shock: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111A3NmM]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The place of therapeutic corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis is controversial. Two main questions still exist in this population. First, is there a group of critically ill patients who are relatively deficient in corticosteroids, and if so, how they should they be treated? Second, do steroids given to all critically ill patients improve outcomes? These questions have been investigated primarily in those patients with septic shock, and sufficient studies have been conducted to allow multiple meta-analyses, including a recently updated Cochrane review. However, not all therapeutic corticosteroids are the same. Even at dose equivalency, some corticosteroids have more immunosuppressive properties (e.g. dexamethasone), and some have more mineralocorticoid and vasoreactive properties (e.g. hydrocortisone). This, tied with the evidence that endogenous glucocorticoids are secreted in a pulsatile manner in health, major surgery and critical illness warranted further analysis of the effects of the individual drugs and the dose regimens used. We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) on the data used for the Cochrane review to establish the likely effectiveness of each drug and therapeutic regimen in adults with septic shock.

### The glucocorticoid receptor and cortisol levels in pediatric septic shock [^117WPk4U]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric septic shock remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Even with the highest level of care, many children succumb to septic shock despite years of research and millions of dollars spent. Heterogeneity among patients with septic shock has resulted in our inability to clearly show beneficial interventions beyond antibiotics and supportive care. This is nowhere more obvious than in our current practice of prescribing adjunctive corticosteroids for patients with refractory septic shock. In an era of precision medicine, we need tools that allow us to better classify patients with septic shock to allow evidence-based practice rather than anecdotal experience.

Whether or not to prescribe corticosteroids for patients with fluid-refractory septic shock has been questioned for more than four decades, and no definitive answer currently exists. Many reviews have summarized these studies. Some studies have suggested benefit, but subsequent trials have not been able to confirm these findings, whereas other studies suggest that there may be harm due to administration of corticosteroids. This was further reiterated with two recent large studies published side by side in the New England Journal of Medicine, again showing conflicting results. Heterogeneity within the septic shock population undoubtedly plays into our confusion in trial results, as patients present with different pathophysiology, pathogens, and comorbidities. Until a more definitive trial can better categorize patients into more than just septic shock or no septic shock, we are unlikely to be able to resolve this question.

### Patient-level meta-analysis of low-dose hydrocortisone in adults with septic shock [^113pjPTo]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Trials and study-level meta-analyses have failed to resolve the role of corticosteroids in the management of patients with septic shock. Patient-level meta-analyses may provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, particularly subgroup effects. METHODS: We pooled individual patient data from septic shock trials investigating the adjunctive use of intravenous hydrocortisone. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality, and it was also analyzed across predefined subgroups. Secondary outcomes included mortality at intensive care unit and hospital discharge, at 28 and 180 days, and vasopressor-, ventilator-, and organ failure–free days. Adverse events included superinfection, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and gastroduodenal bleeding. RESULTS: Of 24 eligible trials (n = 8528), 17 (n = 7882) provided individual patient data, and 7 (n = 5929) provided 90-day mortality. The marginal relative risk (RR) for 90-day mortality of hydrocortisone versus placebo was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.04; P = 0.22; moderate certainty). It was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.92) for hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12) without fludrocortisone. There was no significant differential treatment effect across subgroups. Hydrocortisone was associated with little to no difference in any of the secondary outcomes except vasopressor-free days (mean difference, 1.24 days; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.73; high certainty). Hydrocortisone may not be associated with an increase in the risk of superinfection (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.15; low certainty), hyperglycemia (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.12; low certainty), or gastroduodenal bleeding (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.48; low certainty). Hydrocortisone may be associated with an increase in the risk of hypernatremia (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.56 to 2.60; low certainty) and muscle weakness (n = 2647; RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.49 to 1.99; low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: In this patient-level meta-analysis, hydrocortisone compared with placebo was not associated with reduced mortality for patients with septic shock.

Sepsis without shock — corticosteroid use: We suggest against corticosteroid administration in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Across 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 3176) in sepsis with and without shock, 28-day mortality was 29.3% with corticosteroids versus 31.8% with placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–1.0). In six RCTs (n = 826) limited to sepsis without shock, 28-day mortality was 33.8% with corticosteroids versus 30.6% with placebo (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91–1.34), and hyperglycemia was the most common adverse event while corticosteroids did not increase secondary infections (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87–1.20). In the HYPRESS trial excluding shock, patients received either a continuous infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone for 5 days followed by tapering until day 11 (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190), with no difference in progression to septic shock within 14 days (difference −1.8%; 95% CI −10.7% to 7.2%; p = 0.70) and no significant differences in mechanical ventilation (53.2% vs 59.9%), 28-day mortality (8.8% vs 8.2%), or 180-day mortality (26.8% vs 22.2%).

Opal SM. Corticosteroids for Patients With Septic Shock. JAMA. 2003; 289: 41–42. doi: 10.1001/jama.289.1.41-d To the Editor: I am concerned that Dr Annane and colleagues1 studied a highly selected subgroup of the entire population of septic patients. Of the more than half million patients estimated to have severe sepsis in the United States annually, 2 only a small fraction would have vasopressor- and ventilator-dependent septic shock with documented relative adrenal insufficiency within 1 to 8 hours of the onset of septic shock. Remarkably, only 24% of the patients in this study were bacteremic, yet they experienced an exceedingly high mortality rate of 55% to 61%. The majority of patients had a community-acquired infection with a nonfatal underlying disease state. Such patients should receive optimal supportive care and should have reversible disease physiology.

It remains unclear whether corticosteroids benefit a more heterogeneous population with serious underlying diseases or nosocomial infections. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Corticosteroids in COVID-19 ARDS: evidence and hope during the… [^117GViJq]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, have anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and vasoconstrictive effects, which intensivists have been trying to leverage for decades to improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. In the first description of ARDS in 1967, Ashbaugh and colleagues noted that "corticosteroids appeared to have value in the treatment of patients with fat-embolism and possibly viral pneumonia. "1. Over the intervening decades, many clinical trials have tested the utility of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with pneumonia, septic shock, or ARDS. However, due to limited sample sizes, variable dosing strategies, and inconsistent findings, results remained inconclusive. Uptake of this therapeutic approach was modest in 2014, with only 18% of 2377 patients with ARDS in the LUNG SAFE study receiving corticosteroids.
2.

Over the past 3 years, accruing data from larger, well-conducted randomized clinical trials have suggested benefit of corticosteroids in ARDS and septic shock. The APROCCHSS trial enrolled 1241 patients with septic shock who received high-dose vasopressors for at least 6 hours and found that patients randomized to low-dose hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone had lower 90-day mortality. 3 The ADRENAL trial enrolled 3658 patients with septic shock who were receiving vasopressors for at least 4 hours and found that patients randomized to low-dose hydrocortisone infusion vs placebo had shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and faster resolution of shock, 4 although 90-day mortality was not different.

In meta-analyses that incorporated these recent RCTs, corticosteroid use was associated with more rapid resolution of shock and mechanical ventilation in septic shock and possible lower mortality in both septic shock and ARDS. 6, 7 However, due to inconsistent findings across individual studies and lingering concern that important adverse effects such as secondary infection and delirium may be undermeasured and underreported in these clinical trials, many clinicians remained hesitant to prescribe corticosteroids for these conditions. At the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, guidance regarding corticosteroids was mixed.

Additional therapies — corticosteroids: For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy we suggest using IV corticosteroids (weak recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). The typical corticosteroid is IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg/d given as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion, and initiation is suggested when the dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine is ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation. The guideline-defined ongoing requirement was a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 hours after initiation to maintain the target MAP, and the dose of hydrocortisone is typically 200 mg/d. A meta-analysis conducted for this guideline review found an increase vasopressor-free days (MD, 1.5 days; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.11 days); however, corticosteroid use increased neuromuscular weakness (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.45), without a clear effect on short- or long-term mortality. Recent RCTs used 200 mg per day of IV hydrocortisone in divided doses, with inclusion criteria such as any dose of vasopressor or inotrope for ≥ 4 hours to maintain a MAP > 60mm Hg in ADRENAL, or vasopressor thresholds of ≥ 0.25 μg/kg/min or ≥ 1 mg/hr for at least 6 hours to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in APROCCHSS, and hydrocortisone courses included a maximum of seven days or until ICU discharge or death, seven days, or 200 mg daily for 5 days then tapered over further 6 days depending on the trial.

### When and how to use predictive biomarkers for corticosteroid treatment of septic shock [^116q6VNj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The decision to give glucocorticoids to patients who have septic shock is difficult because of conflicting randomized controlled trial (RCT) level I evidence. Nonetheless, there is some evidence of overuse of corticosteroids in septic shock.

Early cohort studies found that there was an acquired corticosteroid deficiency in septic shock. A subsequent RCT found that corticosteroids lowered mortality in patients who had an abnormal (i.e. inadequate) response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation in septic shock. The ACTH stimulation test has false positives and false negatives and is not recommended for deciding whether or not to administer glucocorticoids in septic shock. Two large multicentre RCTs of corticosteroids in adult septic shock had conflicting results; Ananne and colleagues found significant benefit while Venkatesh and colleagues found no effect of corticosteroids on mortality. The most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign (published prior to Annane and Venkatesh) used a cautionary tone, recommending against corticosteroid use in patients who have responded adequately to norepinephrine. Similarly, but in a more positive tone, the recent Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Critical Illness-related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI) recommend for corticosteroids in patients who do not respond to norepinephrine in septic shock.

One reason for conflicting evidence regarding responses to corticosteroids in septic shock is that different patients have different genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles that define different responses to corticosteroids in septic shock. Alder and colleagues recently made the hypothesis that peripheral leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) expression and serum cortisol levels correlate with the response to glucocorticoids in pediatric septic shock (REF). They measured these biomarkers in a modest size prospective cohort (n = 164) of children who had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or septic shock. The GCR expression levels were lower and the serum cortisol levels were higher in patients who had poorer outcomes. Where does this study leave the clinician who cares for patients with septic shock?

Finding predictive biomarkers — i.e. pharmacogenomic, transcriptional, and proteomic biomarkers that identify patients with improved responses to an intervention — is the holy grail of septic shock management. We found that a novel combination of serum cytokine levels predicted improved responses to glucocorticoid administration in adult septic shock. However, our study and others were made using cohorts of non-randomized patients who were treated with glucocorticoids or were simply observational cohorts such as Alder and colleagues (REF). Accordingly, despite the potential uses of predictive biomarkers in septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign does not recommend any predictive biomarkers.

### Corticosteroids for sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with dose-stratified and fludrocortisone subgroup evaluation [^112AbrFh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Timing of corticosteroid initiation and baseline disease severity may also modulate treatment efficacy. For instance, in patients with COVID-19, delayed initiation of corticosteroids has been associated with attenuated therapeutic benefit, especially among critically ill individuals. These findings suggest that early administration may be crucial in maximizing the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. While sepsis and COVID-19 differ in pathophysiology, both syndromes involve dysregulated host responses and a narrow therapeutic window for immunomodulation. Accordingly, future sepsis trials should consider stratifying patients not only by dose and steroid type, but also by timing and baseline severity to refine clinical recommendations.

Despite the consistent benefit observed for the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality, several limitations warrant attention. Notably, long-term outcomes — such as 90-day or 6-month mortality — were infrequently reported, and adverse events like hyperglycemia, secondary infections, or myopathy were inconsistently documented across studies. This aligns with a recent systematic review that quantified increased hyperglycemia risk while confirming limited evidence for other adverse outcomes. As such, the safety profile of corticosteroid therapy in sepsis remains incompletely characterized. Future meta-analyses incorporating individual patient data (IPD) are needed to better quantify these outcomes and evaluate risk-benefit trade-offs with greater granularity.

Accordingly, future randomized trials should consider stratifying patients not only by dosage and corticosteroid type, but also by disease severity and treatment timing to refine clinical recommendations. Finally, although we applied a rigorous inclusion process, several well-known randomized trials were excluded due to discrepancies in population, intervention strategies, or incomplete outcome reporting. To ensure transparency, these studies and the reasons for their exclusion are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. In addition, the inconsistent diagnostic definitions of sepsis and septic shock used across trials may contribute to underlying clinical heterogeneity. These definitions have been compiled in Supplementary Table S3 to improve interpretability and facilitate future harmonization. Moreover, given the persistent paucity of high-quality data from Asia and other underrepresented regions, future research should prioritize large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials in these settings. Additionally, individual patient data meta-analyses (IPD-MAs) are warranted to better characterize treatment-response heterogeneity and optimize patient-specific corticosteroid strategies. These recommendations are consistent with recent expert reviews emphasizing the evolution of corticosteroid strategies in septic shock, advocating for moderate dosing, individualized treatment plans, and context-specific implementation based on local healthcare realities.

### Emergency medicine updates: management of sepsis and septic shock [^114fvkcb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the management of sepsis and septic shock for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, and rapid diagnosis and management are essential. Antimicrobials should be administered as soon as possible, as delays are associated with increased mortality. Resuscitation targets include mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, mental status, capillary refill time, lactate, and urine output. Intravenous fluid resuscitation plays an integral role in those who are fluid responsive. Balanced crystalloids and normal saline are both reasonable options for resuscitation. Early vasopressors should be initiated in those who are not fluid-responsive. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line vasopressor, and if hypotension persists, vasopressin should be considered, followed by epinephrine. Administration of vasopressors through a peripheral 20-gauge or larger intravenous line is safe and effective. Steroids such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone should be considered in those with refractory septic shock.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning sepsis and septic shock can assist emergency clinicians and improve the care of these patients.

### Final approval for corticosteroids in severe CAP? For sure, in septic shock [^113knzvK]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Jheng‑Yan Wu et al. in Critical Care, assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in sCAP. The authors included the same studies analysed in the ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT guidelines for managing severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the addition of the recent trial by Dequin et al. Jheng‑Yan Wu et al. reported that corticosteroids in patients with sCAP could provide survival benefits and improve clinical outcomes (mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation). Furthermore, they suggest that corticosteroids may have a role in treating sCAP even without initial septic shock. As authors of the guidelines on sCAP, we have updated the meta-analyses of the sCAP guidelines, including the original trials, adding the recent randomised controlled trial by Dequin et al. (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). While the meta-analyses of Jheng-Yan Wu et al. aligned closely with our results in technical terms, the interpretation did not. We consider that their interpretation is not entirely accurate for two main reasons:
Inconclusiveness of evidence: The trial recently published by Dequin et al. which randomised 800 patients to either corticosteroids or placebo, reported a statistically significant reduction in deaths (5.6%) in the corticosteroids group. However, this trial had some particularities. The corticosteroid administered was hydrocortisone, and patients with septic shock at baseline were not included in the trial. They also found a reduced risk of intubation or receiving vasopressors in the hydrocortisone group. This was considered indirect data for shock in our meta-analyses. Therefore, data for Dequin et al. was added only in shock (total), as it is unclear if these patients had septic or other types of shock (Fig. 2). This trial presents contradictory findings compared to the second-largest trial published by Meduri et al. which reported no benefits for corticosteroids. This randomised study with 600 patients used a different corticosteroid, methylprednisolone — adding that there have previously been mixed results for corticosteroid drugs in cases of sCAP. The disparities in their outcomes could be due to differing dosage procedures, antibiotic levels, and changes in how sCAP is identified and classified according to organ failure. While the two largest trials contradict each other, the remaining ones are relatively small and inconclusive. This shows that the evidence is far from conclusive on this topic, a conclusion also reached by Jheng‑Yan Wu et al.
The risk of bias (RoB) in the included trials: In the meta-analysis performed by Jheng‑Yan Wu et al. we consider that authors were less strict in their RoB assessments by assessing all trials to have a low risk of bias in most domains. We strongly believe that this is not the case. In the sCAP guidelines (and our updated) meta-analyses, RoB was assessed more stringently. For instance, in the ICU mortality outcome, four out of seven trials were rated to have unclear RoB in allocation concealment and blinding of outcomes (Fig. 1). The unclear RoB in most trials should cause concern and fuel some reluctance when suggesting corticosteroids for all sCAP patients. In addition, we included some subgroup analyses that Jheng-Yan Wu et al. did not evaluate, such as the development of shock, mechanical ventilation-free days and cardiac complications.

### How we escalate vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock [^113z1ks1]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is defined by the need for vasopressor agents to correct hypotension and lactic acidosis resulting from infection, with 30%-40% case fatality rates. The care of patients with worsening septic shock involves multiple treatment decisions involving vasopressor choices and adjunctive treatments. In this edition of "How I Do It", we provide a case-based discussion of common clinical decisions regarding choice of first-line vasopressor, BP targets, route of vasopressor delivery, use of secondary vasopressors, and adjunctive medications. We also consider diagnostic approaches, treatment, and monitoring strategies for the patient with worsening shock, as well as approaches to difficult weaning of vasopressors.

### The international sepsis forum's controversies in sepsis: corticosteroids should be used to treat septic shock [^116HfrR7]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

The use of corticosteroids in septic shock remains controversial. It has been demonstrated that high doses of steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone) for short periods of time are not beneficial. More recent studies using smaller doses (200–300 mg/day hydrocortisone) for longer periods of time have shown beneficial effects. These positive effects have included reversal of shock, trends toward decreased organ system dysfunction and decreased mortality. Based on the high proportion of patients who have relative adrenal insufficiency, the benefits of low doses of steroids and the minimal risks, steroids should be used to treat septic shock.

### The evolving understanding of glucocorticoid treatment in septic shock [^113vpB9v]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

There has long been interest in adjunctive therapies in septic shock because this condition continues to carry a significant risk of death and long-term sequelae. 1 Adjunctive therapy with glucocorticoids has been the target of many controlled trials in septic shock on the basis of glucocorticoids' multiple putative benefits, including modulation of an excess inflammatory response to infection and treatment of relative adrenal insufficiency due to imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Despite this effort, decades of conflicting trial results have left clinicians without consistent guidance about when, and for whom, to implement glucocorticoid therapy.

### Pro-con debate: steroid use in ACTH non-responsive septic shock patients with high baseline cortisol levels [^116e7d9o]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Steroid use in critically ill, vasopressor-dependant, septic patients has gained increased acceptance in recent years with the publication of encouraging data. However, with renewed interest and/or attention comes increased debate and analysis. As a result, it is not surprising to find that there is still significant controversy with regards to the role of steroids in many patients. In this article, two expert groups debate the role of steroid use in a septic shock patient with arguably no clear evidence of adrenal insufficiency.

Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening systemic dysregulatory response to infection, and septic shock occurs when sepsis leads to systemic vasodilation and subsequent tissue hypoperfusion. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published updated guidelines in 2021 on the management of sepsis and septic shock. Here, in the context of a patient with septic shock, 2 critical care specialists discuss and debate conditional guideline recommendations on using lactate to guide resuscitation, the use of balanced crystalloids versus normal saline, and the use of corticosteroids.

### Do pediatric patients with septic shock benefit from steroid therapy? A critical appraisal of "Low-dose hydrocortisone improves shock reversal and reduces cytokine levels in early hyperdynamic septic shock" by oppert et al. (crit care med 2005; 33: 2457–2464) [^116KqSfH]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the findings and discuss the implications of studies on the use of low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock.

Design

A critical appraisal of "Low-dose hydrocortisone improves shock reversal and reduces cytokine levels in early hyperdynamic septic shock" by Oppert et al. (Crit Care Med 2005; 33:2457–2464) with literature review.

Findings

Previous studies have shown that low-dose corticosteroids shorten duration of shock in adults with sepsis, which is confirmed by the results of Oppert et al. The benefit on mortality is much less clear. Review of the literature casts doubt on whether these data can be extrapolated to children.

Conclusions

There is some, albeit limited, evidence for the benefit of low-dose steroids in adults with sepsis. No supporting data are available for the pediatric population; therefore, a randomized controlled trial in septic children is needed.

Corticosteroids in pediatric septic shock — We suggest against using intravenous hydrocortisone to treat children with septic shock if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest that either intravenous hydrocortisone or no hydrocortisone may be used if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are not able to restore hemodynamic stability (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Updating the evidence for the role of corticosteroids in severe sepsis and septic shock: a Bayesian meta-analytic perspective [^111EcaMD]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Of the seven trials reporting shock-reversal, time to the latter end-point was the primary study end-point in three. All published studies used time-to-event analysis based upon conventional Kaplan-Meier estimates, censoring those who died and/or those in whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn at time of assessment. However, such analyses are problematic, because they ignore the competing risk of those who died and/or those in whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn. In the presence of competing risks Kaplan-Meier estimates cannot be interpreted as probabilities. Under the conditions of competing risks, the probability of an event is more appropriately estimated by the cumulative incidence function, which, for the particular event of interest, is a function of the hazards of all the competing events and not solely of the hazard of the event to which it refers. Hypothesis tests for the cumulative incidence function do not necessarily equate with the familiar log-rank test.

How then are we to understand these favourable effects of low-dose corticosteroids? Glucocorticoid action on inflammation, vascular reactivity and interactions between corticosteroids and 'signalling pathways' may explain the salutary effects in sepsis; anti-inflammatory and coagulation effects would appear to be differentially dose dependent. Low or stress doses of hydrocortisone, as currently prescribed, are not replacement or physiological doses; they generate plasma cortisol levels greater than 2,500 nmol/l, in excess of the usual upper limits (1,000 to 1,500 nmol/l) of patients in septic shock. The presumed immune-modulation of these prolonged low-dose regimens underpins the rationale of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. This being said, the Annane and colleagues trial used a fixed seven-day steroid course without tapering and claimed efficacy and no difference in the complication rates was evident between the high-and low-dose cohorts in both the current and Annane and colleagues' meta-analyses. As mentioned in commentary, differences in control group mortalities of the Annane and colleagues and CORTICUS trials may explain differing outcomes on the basis of risk-related treatment effects. The latter were persuasively demonstrated in the current meta-analysis. The estimate of mortality risk at which low-dose corticosteroids began to exhibit a treatment effect, 44%, was clinically plausible given the range of control-arm mortalities of 30 to 93%. Such demonstration, using appropriate Bayesian methodology, represents a novel insight into critical care therapeutic efficacy.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Septic shock — dose and duration when corticosteroids are used: If using corticosteroids for septic shock, we suggest using long course and low dose (e.g. IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for at ≥ 3 days at full dose) rather than high dose and short course in adult patients with septic shock (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The task force suggests the use of low-dose IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for at least 3 days at full dose in adult patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose (> 0.1 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent) vasopressor therapy; survival benefits were associated with lower doses (< 400 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent per day) and longer duration (3 or more days at the full dose).

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids for the treatment of septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Zt723]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Septic shock is common and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids is common, but definitive data are lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy among patients with septic shock.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for randomized trials and observational studies published from January 1993 through December 2008. Studies were selected if they included adults with septic shock, discussed treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, and reported at least 1 outcome of interest (e.g., mortality, shock reversal, or incidence of superinfection). Two reviewers independently agreed on eligibility, assessed methodologic quality, and abstracted data.

Results

Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for 28-day all-cause mortality, shock reversal at 7 days, and incidence of superinfection with use of random-effects models. Analyses, stratified by adrenal responsiveness, were prespecified. Eight studies (6 randomized trials) involving a total of 1876 patients were selected. Overall, corticosteroid therapy did not result in a statistically significant difference in mortality (42.2% [369 of 875 patients] vs. 38.4% [384 of 1001]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84–1.18). A statistically significant difference in the incidence of shock reversal at 7 days was observed between patients who received corticosteroids and those who did not (64.9% [314 of 484 patients] vs. 47.5% [228 of 480]; RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22–1.64), with similar point estimates for both corticotropin stimulation test responders and nonresponders. No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of superinfection between patients treated with corticosteroids and patients not treated with corticosteroids (25.3% [114 of 450 patients] vs. 22.7% [100 of 441]; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.86–1.42).

Conclusions

In patients with septic shock, corticosteroid therapy appears to be safe but does not reduce 28-day all-cause mortality rates. It does, however, significantly reduce the incidence of vasopressor-dependent shock, which may be a clinically worthwhile goal.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^114JMD6v]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Corticosteroids — evidence summary in sepsis and pediatrics: A recent meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 9,969 adults and 225 children with sepsis found corticosteroids possibly result in a small reduction in short-term mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.03) and long-term mortality (0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00), with faster resolution of shock and shorter length of stay, while possibly increasing neuromuscular weakness risk (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01–1.52); despite a weak recommendation to treat sepsis with hydrocortisone based on this meta-analysis, pediatric studies had small sample sizes, inconsistent conclusions, methodologic limitations, and did not demonstrate an overall mortality reduction, and observational cohorts in children reported either harm or no benefit, including a retrospective analysis showing no differences in outcomes among 133 corticosteroid-treated children versus 284 non-treated.

### Cortisol replacement for severe sepsis and septic shock: what should I do? [^113CBkWf]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Based on several recently completed randomized controlled trials, cortisol replacement is likely to become a standard of care for vasopressor dependent septic shock. Further studies are needed in order to accomplish whether this treatment should be limited to patients with a blunted cortisol response to corticotrophin. Similarly, in patients with severe sepsis who do not need vasopressors, the benefit/risk ratio of cortisol replacement remains to be assessed.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114eYeLh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Source control

Prompt identification of an infectious source is critical and, when source control is possible, intervention should occur as soon as is practical from a medical and logistical standpoint. Intravascular access catheters that are a possible septic source should be removed as soon as alternative access is established. Neither of these recommendations is new from 2012, but the committee removed prior recommendations regarding the timing of intervention for peripancreatic necrosis and the suggestion that the least invasive technique be employed to achieve source control. Nevertheless, these principles are still included in the text of the 2016 guidelines and are likely sound despite there not being sufficient evidence for the committee to include them as recommendations.

Corticosteroids

The SSC recommendations for corticosteroids are simplified significantly in the 2016 guidelines, with many of the prior recommendations being removed due to the lack of sufficient supporting evidence. Corticosteroids should empirically be administered (hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenous daily in divided bolus doses) in patients in septic shock only if vasopressor therapy and fluid resuscitation fail to achieve hemodynamic stability. ACTH stimulation and random cortisol tests are also not recommended to determine need for initiation of steroid therapy. Despite a recommendation that steroids should be continued until vasopressors are discontinued, there is still no clear consensus on the optimal initiation timing and total duration of steroid treatment.

The evidence regarding the efficacy of corticosteroids for the attenuation of and prevention of septic shock remains conflicting. Yende et al in a recent editorial noted that the variation in results from clinical trials may reflect the 'vast array of biological effects' caused by corticosteroid exposure. They further highlight that 'the relative balance of these effects can be difficult to predict'. This is particularly important when using steroids in sepsis because patients exhibit early in the course of illness both elements of inflammation and immunosuppression. The addition of an immunosuppression agent, like corticosteroids, may have undesired effects on restoration of immune system balance whereas its anti-inflammatory properties may be highly desirable early in sepsis. Multiple ongoing large clinical trials are underway to further delineate the role of steroids in sepsis treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01284452 for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome; and ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01448109 for septic shock).

Current understanding

Sepsis is life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In practice, a sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of ≥ 2 in patients with infections is sepsis (table 1). Worldwide, about 30 million people are hospitalised with sepsis every year and up to six million of them die.

Table 1
Sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score to help diagnose sepsis (adapted from Vincent et al)*

P a O 2 = partial pressure of oxygen (arterial). F i O 2 = fraction of inspired oxygen.

Clinicians typically manage sepsis with early, broad spectrum antibiotics. They may provide supportive treatment such as vasoactive drugs and mechanical ventilation. They track and adjust treatment based on clinical signs and laboratory data. Septic shock is the most severe form of sepsis. These patients experience profound circulatory, metabolic, and cellular abnormalities. They require vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure and have elevated serum lactate concentrations despite adequate fluid repletion.

It is possible that corticosteroids help improve the dysregulated immune response caused by sepsisand increase blood pressure if it is low. Some clinicians have found this biological rationale, and results of early studies, compelling. Others disagree and do not use corticosteroids.

Most professional organisations recommend against corticosteroid use in the absence of refractory shock. Table 2 summarises current professional society guidelines.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included sepsis survivors, family caregivers of patients who had sepsis, intensivists, internists, nurses, an endocrinologist, physiotherapists, trialists, and methodologists (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). They decided on the scope of the recommendation and the outcomes that are most important to patients. The panel judged death and quality of life to be the most important outcomes. Myocardial infarction, stroke, duration of stay in hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU), superinfections, and neuromuscular weakness (such as ICU-acquired weakness) were also identified as important outcomes for patients.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1114vmtD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the intensive care unit (ICU), up to 25% of admissions are related to sepsis and an additional 12% of patients develop sepsis during their stay. Sepsis and, if deteriorating, septic shock have a high morbidity and mortality. Depending on the definition of sepsis, mortality varies from 27 to 54%. To decrease this high rate of morbidity and mortality, several interventions have been suggested. Bundled interventions, like those of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, aim to improve outcome of patients by, among others, early antibiotics, glucocorticosteroids (steroids) and supportive care.

Based on supposed pathophysiological mechanisms, two rationales for steroids in sepsis have been put forward. The first rationale is that high dose steroids may suppress the excess in inflammatory response in sepsis. In the 1970s and the early 1980s high dose steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose) were used in sepsis. In the late 1980s the use declined on the basis of negative results of randomised clinical trials; however, in some centres, high dose steroids are still used in clinical practice today. The second rationale, introduced in the 1990s, is that low dose steroids may recover a relative adrenal insufficiency. Many trials have been conducted, but the pathophysiological basis of the second rationale is still questioned. Possibly both high and low dose steroids can have beneficial or harmful effects in sepsis.

Despite the lack of evidence for the underlying mechanism, the use of low doses of 200–300 mg hydrocortisone is recommended in patients with septic shock not responding to fluid and vasopressor therapy. This recommendation is likely based on results of one systematic review, which found a statistically significant 16% relative risk reduction (RRR) of mortality (relative risk 0.84; unadjusted 95% confidence interval 0.72–0.97) in favour of prolonged low dose steroids. The beneficial effect found might be a subgroup effect in more severely ill patients, a spurious finding due to a type I random error as a consequence of repetitive testing as the information size required for showing a 16% RRR was far from being reached, or an overestimation of a treatment effect due to bias and suboptimal trial methodology.

A sound methodology in a systematic review is as important as in any type of study to avoid critical errors in the analyses and conclusions. We therefore decided to conduct a new systematic review evaluating the effects of steroids for sepsis in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock as previous meta-analyses fall short on several aspects of rigorous methodology.

### Recent updates in the pharmacological management of sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review focused on fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and corticosteroids [^116ePJHP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Describe recent developments in the pharmacological management of sepsis and septic shock, focusing on fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and corticosteroids.

Data Sources

A literature search limited to randomized controlled trials written in the English language reporting mortality and other clinically relevant outcomes that were published from July 1, 2016, to August 31, 2018, in patients aged ≥ 18 years. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance. References for pertinent review articles were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant randomized controlled trials conducted in patients meeting the pre-defined inclusion criteria were considered for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

From an initial search that identified 147 studies, 14 original research studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the Revised Cochrane ROB assessment tool, with most included studies having a low ROB. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Sepsis and septic shock pose a significant burden on public health. Despite advances in our understanding of sepsis, mortality remains unacceptably high. Recent developments in the pharmacological management of septic shock have focused on determining optimal composition and dosage of fluid resuscitation, enhanced use of vasopressor therapy, and clarifying the role of corticosteroids. This systematic review will provide recommendations for application to practice focusing on recent research on these topics.

Conclusions

Although recent developments in the pharmacological management of sepsis are encouraging, clinicians must be keen to utilize patient-specific factors to guide therapy and continue to strive to address the remaining unanswered questions.

### Pediatric sepsis diagnosis, management, and sub-phenotypes [^116rU31P]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for children worldwide, including > 3 million deaths annually and, among survivors, risk for new or worsening functional impairments, including reduced quality of life, new respiratory, nutritional, or technological assistance, and recurrent severe infections. Advances in understanding sepsis pathophysiology highlight a need to update the definition and diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock, whereas new data support an increasing role for automated screening algorithms and biomarker combinations to assist earlier recognition. Once sepsis or septic shock is suspected, attention to prompt initiation of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasoactive medications remain key components to initial management with several new and ongoing studies offering new insights into how to optimize this approach. Ultimately, a key goal is for screening to encompass as many children as possible at risk for sepsis and trigger early treatment without increasing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and preventable hospitalizations. Although the role for adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and other metabolic therapies remains incompletely defined, ongoing studies will soon offer updated guidance for optimal use. Finally, we are increasingly moving toward an era in which precision therapeutics will bring novel strategies to improve outcomes, especially for the subset of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis subphenotypes for whom antibiotics, fluid, vasoactive medications, and supportive care remain insufficient.

### Corticosteroids for sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with dose-stratified and fludrocortisone subgroup evaluation [^116eKxGa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This updated meta-analysis demonstrates that low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids — specifically intravenous hydrocortisone at 200–300 mg/day — are associated with a significant reduction in 28-day mortality among adult patients with sepsis or septic shock. These findings are consistent with current guideline recommendations and support the integration of corticosteroids as part of standard supportive care.

By incorporating dose-stratified and region-specific subgroup analyses, our study adds clarity to prior heterogeneous syntheses and highlights the importance of tailoring steroid regimens based on patient characteristics, institutional resources, and geographic context. These findings align with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which conditionally recommends hydrocortisone at 200 mg/day for refractory septic shock despite low-to-moderate certainty (SSC, 2021). Notably, the consistent but modest effects observed in Chinese trials contrast with the greater yet more variable effects in non-Chinese studies, emphasizing the need for regionally adapted treatment strategies.

However, long-term outcomes (e.g. 90-day mortality) and safety profiles — particularly concerning hyperglycemia, infection risk, and myopathy — remain insufficiently reported in the existing literature. Future randomized trials should evaluate these endpoints and consider stratifying patients by dose, steroid type, timing of administration, and baseline severity to better personalize treatment.

Although this meta-analysis was not prospectively registered on PROSPERO or any public platform due to its retrospective design and reliance on previously published data, a predefined protocol was developed and rigorously followed. Nevertheless, the lack of formal registration is acknowledged as a methodological limitation.

In conclusion, moderate-dose corticosteroids — with or without adjunctive fludrocortisone — represent a rational, evidence-based adjunct in the management of septic shock, pending further confirmation from large-scale, multicenter trials.
