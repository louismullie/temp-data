## Question

Mesenteric ischemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mesenteric ischemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical problem and why mesenteric ischemia is an emergency. Then, I should verify the key risk factors and pathophysiologic subtypes. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and the diagnostic strategy, including labs and imaging. After that, I need to check the initial stabilization steps and when to involve a multidisciplinary team. Then, I will examine subtype-specific management, including arterial embolic/thrombotic disease, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. I should also consider special scenarios like isolated SMA dissection and chronic mesenteric ischemia. Finally, I will review prognostic factors, long-term management, and surveillance, and close with a concise decision algorithm that integrates these elements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem framing. Mesenteric ischemia is a vascular catastrophe with high mortality, often exceeding 50% and rising with delay. It is rare but lethal, and outcomes hinge on early recognition and timely intervention, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion in the right clinical context [^116EzRBj] [^113hxEkf] [^111kRbEc].

> I need to check the etiologic subtypes and their relative frequencies. Arterial embolism accounts for roughly half of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), arterial thrombosis for about 15–25%, mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) for 5–15%, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) for about 20–25%. These proportions vary by population and era, but the hierarchy is consistent across contemporary series [^111rouix] [^115JgXqG] [^117RviqR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk factors without verifying them against guidelines. For arterial embolism, atrial fibrillation and valvular disease are common sources. For arterial thrombosis, atherosclerotic risk factors and chronic mesenteric ischemia predominate. For MVT, hypercoagulable states, malignancy, and intra-abdominal inflammatory processes are key. And for NOMI, low-flow states, vasopressors, sepsis, and critical illness drive microcirculatory failure, so I should tailor suspicion to the patient's comorbid profile and context [^1167p6KQ] [^117L26XZ] [^114MSfM2].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation. The classic clue is severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the exam, often abrupt in embolic disease and more insidious in thrombotic or venous etiologies. NOMI may present with vague pain or distension in critically ill patients, and peritonitis is a late sign suggesting transmural necrosis, so I must not wait for peritoneal signs before imaging [^116LgXPA] [^111XxLXX] [^111kRbEc].

> Wait, let me verify the role of laboratory testing before I overinterpret it. Lactate has reasonable sensitivity but poor specificity and a normal lactate does not exclude AMI; D-dimer is sensitive but nonspecific; no biomarker reliably rules in or out AMI, so labs support suspicion but cannot replace imaging or clinical judgment [^112S3WV1] [^116TBeu4].

> I will now examine the diagnostic imaging strategy. Multidetector CT angiography (CTA) with IV contrast is the first-line test and should be obtained emergently; a triphasic protocol (noncontrast, arterial, venous/delayed) with thin slices and MIP reconstructions optimizes detection of occlusion, bowel wall enhancement changes, and venous thrombosis; oral contrast should be avoided due to delays; if CTA is contraindicated or unavailable, TEE can be considered in unstable patients, but I should explicitly request AMI be suspected in the CTA order to expedite protocolization [^116oR9fi] [^115U7DRB] [^116ZW4Zj] [^116urSkj] [^115X2Zho].

> Let me think about initial stabilization while imaging is arranged. Immediate IV crystalloids, correction of electrolytes, broad-spectrum antibiotics for translocation risk, and systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin unless contraindicated are foundational. I should avoid vasopressors when possible, but if needed after volume, I must choose agents with minimal splanchnic vasoconstrictive effect. Early multidisciplinary activation with vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and critical care is essential to reduce time-to-reperfusion [^1111B9HS] [^113rqGZH] [^115ybAG6] [^112qR2RN] [^112j82jC].

> Now, I should confirm the subtype-specific management for arterial embolic AMI. Embolectomy is generally preferred when feasible because of rapid reperfusion; endovascular options exist but may be slower and risk ongoing ischemia; post-procedure antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is reasonable if the embolic source remains, and I need to ensure revascularization precedes irreversible necrosis whenever possible [^1167p6KQ] [^114rtNpi] [^114EHJFT].

> For arterial thrombotic AMI, let me verify the balance between endovascular and open strategies. Endovascular-first is favored in hemodynamically stable patients without peritonitis, with lower short- and long-term mortality in observational data; however, in shock or with peritonitis, a joint open approach may be necessary to enable simultaneous revascularization and resection, so I should align the plan with physiology and CT findings rather than dogma [^1167p6KQ] [^114EHJFT] [^116Zok6y].

> I need to ensure I address MVT correctly. Systemic anticoagulation is first-line. Evaluate for underlying causes including thrombophilia, malignancy, and inflammatory disease. If symptoms persist despite anticoagulation and there is no necrosis, catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy can be considered. Duration of anticoagulation is typically 3–6 months for reversible causes and lifelong for thrombophilia or recurrence [^116dD6CG] [^117L26XZ] [^117XW4c2] [^114rtNpi].

> But wait, what if this is NOMI driven by low flow and vasoconstriction. I should prioritize correcting the precipitant, optimizing perfusion, and consider intra-arterial vasodilators such as papaverine or prostaglandin E1. Early laparotomy is not recommended unless there is peritonitis or refractory shock, because surgical stress can worsen splanchnic ischemia. Close monitoring for deterioration is mandatory [^1159CfiY] [^115JgXqG] [^112CeMza].

> Let me consider special scenarios. For isolated SMA dissection, conservative management with blood pressure and pain control is first-line. Antiplatelet therapy is reasonable. Endovascular therapy is reserved for failure of medical therapy or evolving ischemia. Annual duplex surveillance is advised to detect aneurysm or progressive stenosis [^111pxMJW] [^114phjhX] [^111PQYvk] [^112q99Zu].

> Next, I should review chronic mesenteric ischemia. Patients classically have postprandial pain, food fear, and weight loss. Diagnosis relies on CTA or MRA demonstrating significant mesenteric stenoses, typically involving at least two vessels. Endovascular revascularization with balloon-expandable covered stents is the recommended initial therapy, with open bypass reserved for failures or select young patients [^112RNGy7] [^115YruMT] [^116sQMd6].

> I should double-check prognostic factors that influence decisions and counseling. High lactate, tachycardia, respiratory distress, organ failure, absent bowel wall enhancement, ileal or multisegment involvement, and need for open surgery correlate with worse outcomes; however, prognostication is fraught early, so I must avoid premature conclusions and focus on timely intervention while aligning with patient goals of care [^115ETL7S] [^116TBeu4].

> Let me verify the long-term management and surveillance after AMI. After thrombotic arterial AMI, lifelong statin and antiplatelet therapy is advised; after embolic AMI, indefinite systemic anticoagulation is recommended; after MVT, anticoagulation duration follows etiology; after mesenteric stenting, duplex ultrasound at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and annually is prudent, with escalation if velocities rise or symptoms recur; dual antiplatelet therapy is commonly used short term after stenting, transitioning to single agent long term [^115BAwch] [^115YruMT].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Recognize with a high index of suspicion for pain out of proportion, resuscitate aggressively, reflect on etiology and goals, revascularize urgently based on subtype and physiology, resect only what is clearly nonviable with planned second-look when uncertain, and reevaluate bowel viability and patient trajectory. This "six R" framework operationalizes evidence-based care and reduces delays [^114d4EtB] [^1167p6KQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure system-level considerations are explicit. Management in centers with 24/7 multidisciplinary capabilities, standardized pathways, and hybrid rooms improves time-to-reperfusion and outcomes. Explicit mention of AMI on imaging requests, early vascular team involvement, and regionalization to experienced centers are practical steps that save lives [^112j82jC] [^112qR2RN] [^116urSkj].

Mesenteric ischemia is a **life-threatening reduction in intestinal blood flow** [^111V4QqM] that can be acute or chronic, with acute forms carrying high mortality if not promptly recognized and treated [^113hxEkf]. The **key clinical clue is severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the exam** [^116LgXPA], especially in older adults with cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation [^113WTmFK]. Early diagnosis relies on **contrast-enhanced CT angiography** [^116oR9fi], which is the gold standard and should be obtained urgently when suspicion is high [^116ZW4Zj]. Management is **time-critical** [^112qeWXa] and includes immediate resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation, followed by revascularization (endovascular or open) [^113rqGZH] [^114EHJFT] and bowel resection when necrosis is present [^116WjhYE]. Delays in diagnosis and treatment markedly increase mortality, so a high index of suspicion and rapid multidisciplinary care are essential [^114d4EtB] [^112j82jC].

## Etiology and classification

Mesenteric ischemia is classified by **etiology and chronicity** [^114rtNpi]:

| **Type** | **Etiology** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) | - Arterial embolism (50%) [^111rouix] <br/> - Arterial thrombosis (15–25%) <br/> - Mesenteric venous thrombosis (5–15%) <br/> - Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) (20–30%) | - Sudden severe abdominal pain [^116LgXPA] <br/> - Peritonitis <br/> - Shock <br/> - High mortality [^113hxEkf] |
| Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) | - Atherosclerotic stenosis/occlusion of mesenteric arteries [^112RNGy7] | - Postprandial pain <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Food fear [^115YruMT] |

---

## Pathophysiology

- **AMI**: Sudden reduction in mesenteric blood flow causes ischemia, inflammation, and necrosis; irreversible damage can occur within 6 hours [^111XxLXX].
- **CMI**: Chronic reduced flow causes ischemia with collateral development; acute thrombosis can precipitate AMI [^112RNGy7].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **AMI**: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to exam [^116LgXPA], nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleeding, peritonitis, shock [^111XxLXX].
- **CMI**: Postprandial pain, weight loss, food fear, abdominal bruit [^115YruMT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests are nonspecific; **lactate and D-dimer** may be elevated but are not diagnostic [^112S3WV1] [^116TBeu4].

---

### Imaging studies

- **CT angiography (CTA)**: Gold standard [^116ZW4Zj]; high sensitivity/specificity; identifies occlusion, bowel wall changes, pneumatosis [^112S3WV1].
- **MRI**: Alternative when CTA is contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Plain radiography**: Not recommended [^115D4yFB].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute mesenteric ischemia

- **Immediate resuscitation**: Fluids, electrolytes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation [^1111B9HS] [^113rqGZH].
- **Revascularization**: Endovascular first-line [^114EHJFT]; open surgery if endovascular fails or bowel necrosis present [^113692UZ].
- **Bowel resection**: For necrotic segments; second-look laparotomy may be needed [^114hzTZu].

---

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia

For chronic mesenteric ischemia, **endovascular revascularization** is first-line (angioplasty/stenting) [^115R1A2Q], with open bypass reserved for endovascular failure or unsuitable anatomy [^115R1A2Q].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **poor without prompt treatment**, with mortality exceeding 50% in AMI [^113hxEkf]. Complications include bowel infarction, sepsis, short bowel syndrome, and recurrent ischemia [^115BAwch].

---

## Preventive measures and risk factors

Risk factors include cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercoagulable states [^111kRbEc]. Prevention focuses on **risk-factor modification**, **anticoagulation for AF**, and **regular surveillance after revascularization** [^115BAwch].

---

Mesenteric ischemia is a **surgical emergency** requiring rapid recognition, imaging, and intervention [^1173aRgb]. Early, multidisciplinary care is critical to reduce mortality and morbidity [^111rouix].

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is caused by sudden interruption of blood supply to the intestine, leading to cellular damage, intestinal necrosis, and commonly patient death if untreated. AMI may be occlusive or non-occlusive (NOMI), with the primary etiology further defined as mesenteric arterial embolism (50%), mesenteric arterial thrombosis (15–25%), or mesenteric venous thrombosis (5–15%). The overall incidence is low (0.09–0.2% of all acute admissions to emergency departments), representing an infrequent cause of abdominal pain, but a common cause of emergent intestinal resection. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential to reduce the mortality rates that exceed 50%.

Traditionally, AMI has been treated with open surgery. Over the past two decades, the rapid development of endovascular techniques has made this approach an important alternative for patients with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Some studies have shown that endovascular therapy is associated with lower rates of mortality and bowel resection than the traditional, open approach.

The assessment and therapy carried out by an interdisciplinary team should keep the time-to-reperfusion interval as short as possible. In addition, advances in postoperative care have improved outcome for patients with short bowel syndrome. Both in-hospital care and further bowel rehabilitation lead to increase survival and better long-term outcome with acceptable quality of life.

Introducing a clinical pathway and centers of excellence results in higher awareness of AMI, more appropriate imaging, less delays, increased number of revascularizations, and, therefore, lower mortality.

Accordingly, the present paper aims to provide an update with recommendations based on the most currently accepted concepts in the management of AMI.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of acute mesenteric ischemia: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms working group [^114d4EtB]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This algorithm was developed by the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery Emergency General Surgery Algorithms working group, to guide the management of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) in adult patients. It is based on published peer-reviewed evidence and expert opinions of the working group and represents a safe and sensible approach that can be implemented at most centers. The algorithm (Fig. 1) is annotated with letters; the corresponding text includes rationale and citations of supporting data. This article is not a comprehensive summary of the literature, and the algorithm is not a substitute for the clinical judgment and experience of the bedside clinician; it should not be considered the "standard of care". We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the algorithm, and we encourage institutions to use these recommendations to formulate local protocols. The annotated algorithm is intended to (a) serve as a quick bedside reference for clinicians, (b) foster more detailed patient care protocols that will allow for prospective data collection and analysis to identify best practices, and (c) generate research projects to answer specific questions concerning decision making in the management of adults with AMI.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the diagnosis and management of AMI.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is a life-threatening condition that is increasing in prevalence as the population ages. Acute mesenteric ischemia includes acute mesenteric arterial embolism or thrombosis, nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT).

Approximately 1% of patients with acute abdomen have AMI, but among those older than 70 years, it may be as high as 10%. In one Finnish study, AMI was the most common etiology of acute abdominal pain in patients older than 75 years. Prompt clinical recognition and intervention are critical, as ischemic injury to the bowel can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis, sepsis, multiple-organ failure, and death. The overall mortality associated with AMI exceeds 50% and doubles with every 6 hours of delay in treatment. The current algorithm (Fig. 1) is conceptually based on "six R's": Recognize, Resuscitate, Reflect, Revascularize, Resect, and Reevaluate. While some acute care surgeons may manage all aspects of the treatment, in many institutions, a multidisciplinary approach is followed, which may involve general and vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and critical care specialists.

Survivors of AMI are at increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as chronic pain, bowel obstructions, and recurring ischemic events. After thrombotic arterial occlusion, patients should be maintained on lifelong statin and antiplatelet therapy. After embolic AMI, patients should receive lifelong vitamin K antagonist or oral anticoagulant drugs (i.e. direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa antagonists). For venous thrombosis, if the diagnosis was secondary to a reversible cause, patients need anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months; however, if there is proven thrombophilia or recurrence, patients will require lifelong anticoagulation. For a patient who underwent mesenteric artery stenting or bypass, if there is no recurrence of symptoms, the recommendation is duplex ultrasound within 1 month, at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. A contrast study is indicated if recurrent symptoms or a substantial increase in peak systolic velocity on duplex is present. After stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended. To mitigate bleeding risk, single agent therapy is recommended for the long term. Ultimately, the long-term outlook for AMI survivors is closely tied to the extent of initial tissue injury, the success of surgical interventions, and the management of subsequent complications, making a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach essential for optimizing recovery and quality of life.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^112RNGy7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) results from the inability to achieve adequate postprandial intestinal blood flow, usually from atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels. Patients typically present with postprandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, although they can present with acute mesenteric ischemia and bowel infarction. The diagnosis requires a combination of the appropriate clinical symptoms and significant mesenteric artery occlusive disease, although it is often delayed given the spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders associated with abdominal pain and weight loss. The treatment goals include relieving the presenting symptoms, preventing progression to acute mesenteric ischemia, and improving overall quality of life. These practice guidelines were developed to provide the best possible evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CMI from atherosclerosis.

Methods

The Society for Vascular Surgery established a committee composed of vascular surgeons and individuals experienced with evidence-based reviews. The committee focused on six specific areas, including the diagnostic evaluation, indications for treatment, choice of treatment, perioperative evaluation, endovascular/open revascularization, and surveillance/remediation. A formal systematic review was performed by the evidence team to identify the optimal technique for revascularization. Specific practice recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system based on review of literature, the strength of the data, and consensus.

Results

Patients with symptoms consistent with CMI should undergo an expedited workup, including a computed tomography arteriogram, to exclude other potential causes. The diagnosis is supported by significant arterial occlusive disease in the mesenteric vessels, particularly the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment requires revascularization with the primary target being the superior mesenteric artery. Endovascular revascularization with a balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent is the recommended initial treatment with open repair reserved for select younger patients and those who are not endovascular candidates. Long-term follow-up and surveillance are recommended after revascularization and for asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric occlusive disease. Patient with recurrent symptoms after revascularization owing to recurrent stenoses should be treated with an endovascular-first approach, similar to the de novo lesion.

Conclusions

These practice guidelines were developed based on the best available evidence. They should help to optimize the care of patients with CMI. Multiple areas for future research were identified.

### Management challenges in a patient presenting with acute mesenteric ischaemia [^111BWYCi]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A man in his 60s presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and obstipation for the last 2 days. His examination revealed a tender abdomen. The contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen reported superior mesenteric artery thrombosis with ischaemic changes in the bowel. After initial resuscitation, an exploratory laparotomy was done, revealing a gangrenous small bowel of 323 cm, which was resected, and a double-barrel jejuno-ileostomy was performed. Postoperatively, total parenteral nutrition was started and gradually replaced with oral supplements and refeeding of bowel contents. One week after discharge, the patient presented with features of severe dehydration and short bowel syndrome. After resuscitation and stabilisation, restoration of bowel continuity was performed. The patient developed the refeeding syndrome postsurgery, which was managed with micronutrient supplementation. This case highlights the challenges of managing a patient with short bowel syndrome, including timely surgical intervention, postoperative monitoring and appropriate nutritional management for the best outcome.

Abstract

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with high mortality rates. There are multiple challenges to establishing an accurate early diagnosis and providing state-of-the-art care for AMI patients. A high index of suspicion is key for early diagnosis. Once suspicion is raised, a triphasic computed tomography angiography is the essential diagnostic tool. Avoiding delays, using hybrid operating rooms and contemporary revascularization techniques for arterial occlusive AMI, can significantly improve the prognosis. Regional health care systems should be developed to direct AMI patients into centers with sufficient capabilities for providing all aspects of care at all hours. The acute care surgeon has a central role in performing laparotomies and bowel resections when needed and coordinating the management flow in close collaboration with vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists for prompt and effective revascularization. A significant share of patients with an arterial occlusive AMI can be managed by endovascular revascularization without the need for a laparotomy. There are no reliable tools for predicting transmural bowel necrosis, and individual assessment and clinical experience are very important in decision-making when choosing between laparotomy and close observation. During laparotomy, an atherosclerotic occlusion at the root of the superior mesenteric artery can be stented by using a retrograde open mesenteric or percutaneous approach, and surgical bypass is seldom needed. Using hospital-specific management pathways is very useful for the standardization of care in arterial occlusive AMI. In venous AMI, systemic anticoagulation is sufficient in most cases. In patients whose symptoms do not resolve, there are various options for endovascular and surgical revascularization. In nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, prevention by maintaining sufficient abdominal perfusion pressure is key. High-level evidence is scarce, but with current knowledge, the prognosis of AMI patients has plenty of room for improvement.

Conclusions

AMI is a true surgical emergency. First and foremost, important evidence is a high index of suspicion based on the combination of history of abrupt onset of abdominal pain, acidosis, and organ failure. This clinical scenario should prompt imaging (CTA) in order to establish the diagnosis. In parallel with rapid resuscitation and after careful assessment of the CTA, the patient should be explored to assess bowel viability, re-establish vascular flow, and resect non-viable bowel. Subsequently, the employment of damage control techniques and continued critical care resuscitation is essential. Planned re-assessment of the bowel with further resection or anastomosis and stoma as needed is integral. Close cooperation between acute care surgeons, radiologists, anesthetists, and the vascular surgeons is essential.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered immediately. Unless contraindicated, patients should be anticoagulated with intravenous unfractionacted heparin. (Recommendation 1B)

The high risk of infection among patients with AMI outweighs the risks of acquired antibiotic resistance, and therefore broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered early in the course of treatment. Intestinal ischemia leads to early loss of the mucosal barrier, which facilitates bacterial translocation and the risk of septic complications.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^116sQMd6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) — scope, definition, imaging, and treatment trends: The guidelines were "limited to patients with CMI related to atherosclerotic occlusive disease" and define CMI as ischemic symptoms from insufficient intestinal blood flow "for a duration of 3 months", while the current guidelines "do not address the management of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) or nonatherosclerotic causes (eg, median arcuate ligament syndrome, SMA dissection)". For diagnosis, "CTA is currently recommended as the first-line imaging study for mesenteric ischemia (both acute and chronic)". For therapy, "Endovascular treatment with angioplasty and intraluminal stents has largely replaced open surgical bypass as the first treatment option for mesenteric revascularization", with use that "has increased 10-fold over the past decade and now accounts for more than 70% of the initial revascularization procedures". Symptom patterns "do not occur unless at least two of the mesenteric vessels are involved", though "symptoms can develop in patients with single vessel disease, particularly the SMA".

### Management of acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134a1nF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In our analysis, a clear signal for the advantage of the endovascular approach seems to be abolished by adjusting for just two laboratory variables at baseline, available in all four applicable studies. Such an analysis, including only four studies, is of low precision, and the two laboratory variables probably do not adequately represent disease severity. Nevertheless, our results support the hypothesis that in these studies, mortality is driven by patients' severity of illness rather than the management strategy and highlight that the current level of detail when reporting the results is insufficient.

In our review, it was decided not to adjust for age and comorbidities of AMI patients. These characteristics are commonly reported in studies, but while they may be important prognostic factors for mortality and may, in some cases, also influence the selection of the treatment strategy (e.g. initiation of end-of-life care, or decision not to operate if endovascular approach fails), they do not reflect AMI-related severity of illness.

In clinical practice, patients presenting with peritonitis due to any subtype of AMI are commonly allocated to initial surgical treatment, whereas patients with mild symptoms and occlusive arterial AMI undergo endovascular revascularization, when available. Thus, patients allocated to these two treatments differ in their severity of illness at baseline, and it is not surprising that crude analysis comparing endovascular revascularization and open surgery as initial treatment approaches shows higher mortality in the open surgery group. Additionally, patient selection through referral may also play a role, as most severely ill patients will unlikely be transferred to a center with competence in endovascular approach. In the recent AMESI study, mortality in a specialized intestinal stroke unit with 99% of patients being referred for mainly endovascular treatment, was six times lower than in other sites, whereas clinical indices (need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, illness severity and organ dysfunction scores, and laboratory variables reflecting inflammation, disordered metabolism and coagulation) suggested significantly less severe illness at admission. These findings suggested that direct unadjusted comparisons of treatment strategies in observational studies are not appropriate, giving rationale to the current systematic review. In line with our findings, a retrospective study in patients with AMI has demonstrated that anatomical factors alone, measured using the American association for the surgery of trauma grading system for acute mesenteric ischemia, are not sufficient in predicting outcomes and can only be improved by further adjusting for disease severity reflected as vasopressor use, creatinine, and lactate.

REVASCULARIZE

Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, we recommend completing revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories (arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, NOMI, and MVT), the relative distribution of which depends upon the patient population being served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

F. Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all AMI diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have concurrent atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Thrombolytic therapy is an option, but it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse clot and risks progression of bowel ischemia. Postintervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small-vessel thrombosis and is recommended as long as the source of potential emboli remains.

G. Arterial thrombosis has increased in recent decades, accounting for about 40% of all cases. The gradual formation of plaque can eventually progress to critical stenosis with thrombosis of mesenteric vessels, and patients with acute on chronic disease will often have concurrent atherosclerosis and stenosis of the celiac artery. Thrombosis typically occurs at the origin of the celiac trunk, SMA, and inferior mesenteric artery. Endovascular treatment options include thrombectomy and angioplasty with or without stenting. Compared with open techniques, endovascular revascularization is associated with lower short -and long-term mortality; however, there is no significant difference in the need for second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. – If bypass is performed, antegrade is preferred over retrograde because of a lower reintervention rate. If the patient has shock, peritonitis, or evidence of bowel necrosis on CT, then a joint procedure is recommended, including open revascularization, to reduce time to resection of necrotic intestine.

### Management of acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xNXSo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance on managing acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is largely based on expert opinion and retrospective studies pooling different subtypes of AMI. In clinical practice, management strategy is often selected based on the patient's severity of illness, whereas randomized controlled trials or even adjusted analyses comparing different strategies are rarely available. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of different management options when adjusted for the baseline severity of illness.

Methods

A literature search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus. Studies recruiting patients after the year 2000, assessing at least 10 adult patients with reliably confirmed AMI, and comparing different management approaches were considered for inclusion. Thirteen study questions on different management strategies in different subtypes of AMI were formulated a priori. We included studies reporting results of adjusted analyses or reporting any variables reflecting the severity of illness in both study groups under comparison.

Results

A total of 3324 publications were identified, 321 were selected for full-text review and 31 included in the review and analysis. Most of the studies comparing different management strategies of AMI did not report the severity of illness in the groups under comparison. Any variable that could be considered to reflect the severity of illness was reported in 26 studies. The available data only allowed one meta-regression analysis comparing initial endovascular revascularization versus open surgery in arterial occlusive AMI, including four studies that reported white blood cell count and lactate. The results indicate that the significant advantage of the endovascular approach suggested in the crude analysis may be abolished when adjusting for the severity of the illness. Narrative summaries and raw data are presented for other research questions.

Conclusions

The severity of illness plays an important role in the selection of management strategy and largely determines the outcome of any treatment, yet is generally not considered in available studies assessing the management of AMI. There is a major gap in the literature precluding appropriate analyses on treatment effects. Future studies should report subtypes of AMI and the severity of illness for each group.

Mesenteric ischemia is a serious medical condition characterized by insufficient vascular supply to the small bowel. In the acute setting, endovascular interventions, including embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stent placement, are recommended as initial therapeutic options. For nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, transarterial infusion of vasodilators, such as papaverine or prostaglandin E1, is the recommended initial treatment. In the chronic setting, endovascular means of revascularization, including angioplasty and stent placement, are generally recommend, with surgical options, such as bypass or endarterectomy, considered alternative options. Although the diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome remains controversial, diagnostic angiography can be helpful in rendering a diagnosis, with the preferred treatment option being a surgical release. Systemic anticoagulation is recommended as initial therapy for venous mesenteric ischemia with acceptable rates of recanalization. If anticoagulation fails, transcatheter thrombolytic infusion can be considered with possible adjunctive placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to augment antegrade flow. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Debate: whether an endovascular-first strategy is the optimal approach for treating acute mesenteric ischemia [^1136EQMh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia continues to be a life-threatening insult in often-elderly patients with many comorbidities. Recognition and correct diagnosis can be an issue leading to delays in therapy that result in loss of bowel or life, or both. The basic surgical principals in treating acute mesenteric ischemia have long been early recognition, resuscitation, urgent revascularization, resection of necrotic bowel, and reassessment with second-look laparotomies. Endovascular techniques now offer a less invasive alternative, but whether an endovascular-first or open surgery-first approach is preferred in most patients is unclear. Our discussants will attempt to clarify these issues.

### Open and endovascular management of acute mesenteric ischaemia: a systematic review [^116Zok6y]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a life-threatening surgical emergency resulting from thromboembolic occlusion of the mesenteric vasculature. Traditional management of AMI has been open revascularisation with or without bowel resection-a procedure which carries considerable morbidity and mortality in an already unwell, compromised patient. Endovascular and more minimally invasive management approaches to AMI have been reported. Proponents of endovascular management suggest this approach may be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality compared with open surgery.

Objectives

To assess the impact of endovascular approach for AMI on mortality and need for subsequent laparotomy and/or bowel resection.

Data Sources

The search bodies PubMed and Medline were interrogated.

Eligibility Criteria, Participants and Interventions

All studies in English with greater than 10 patients examining outcomes for patients undergoing endovascular intervention for acute mesenteric ischaemia were included. All patients over 18 years presenting with a diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia secondary to an arterial thromboembolic source were included. Studies examining endovascular intervention alone or endovascular and open intervention were selected.

Results

The 30-day mortality for endovascular approach from all 13 studies was 16–42%. Of the 7 comparative studies including results of open revascularisation, the 30-day mortality for patient treated with an endovascular approach was 15–39% versus 33–50% for open revascularisation. Laparotomy rates post-initial endovascular intervention ranged from 13 to 73%. Bowel resection post-endovascular therapy ranged from 14 to 40% among studies. Concerning 7 comparative studies for open versus endovascular revascularisation, the rate of bowel resection in the endovascular group ranged 14–28% and 33–63% in the open cohort. Endovascular intervention also demonstrated lower median length (s) of bowel resected.

Limitations

Heterogeneity of studies and patient populations studied including selection bias.

Conclusions and Implications Of Findings

Endovascular management may be associated with reduced mortality and need for/length of bowel resection compared with the traditional open approach, but there remains a paucity of robust data to support this. The available literature illustrates that a subgroup of patients without haemodynamic compromise and more insidious onset may garner benefit from endovascular intervention.

### Managing acute mesenteric ischaemia [^112d4XAK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a condition where different etiopathogenetic pathways may lead to necrosis of the bowel and thereby to lethal outcome. Despite the common threat of intestinal necrosis, different subtypes of AMI (occlusive arterial, occlusive venous and non-occlusive) have variable incidence, are managed differently and lead to different outcomes. In this article, we summarize recent evidence related to diagnosis, management and outcomes of AMI.

To the editor,

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) represents a life-threatening vascular emergency requiring urgent intervention, yet significant debate persists regarding the optimal initial revascularization strategy — endovascular therapy versus open surgery. We read with great interest the substudy by Kase et al. derived from the prospective AMESI project, comparing endovascular and surgical management for acute superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion (10.1186/s13017-025-00616-4). The authors are to be commended for undertaking this ambitious multinational, prospective observational study, providing valuable real-world data on a condition notoriously difficult to study due to its rarity and acuity. Their findings that initial treatment choice (endovascular vs. surgical) and revascularization itself did not independently influence mortality after adjusting for illness severity are significant and highlight the paramount importance of patient condition at presentation. While the study robustly demonstrates the critical role of baseline severity (evidenced by lactate, need for mechanical ventilation) in driving outcomes, several nuanced aspects warrant further consideration to refine our understanding and guide future research towards optimizing patient selection and management pathways.

### Management of acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bPgsh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

While observational studies with different baseline characteristics are problematic, planning randomized controlled trials in this area is difficult and necessitates defining a patient group where both tested treatment strategies are considered appropriate. Randomizing a patient without transmural ischaemia to surgery and a patient with peritonitis to endovascular management would not be appropriate. Any evidence-based guidance can probably not be achieved without an appropriate description of groups under comparison in future studies.

It needs to be underlined that there is no consensus on which markers should be used to describe the severity of illness. Moreover, the severity of illness can only be considered as a surrogate marker of the progression/magnitude of intestinal ischaemia. In case of NOMI, the severity of illness may reflect the primary pathology (e.g. septic or cardiogenic shock) rather than bowel damage. Accordingly, markers (e.g. laboratory, radiological) reflecting the magnitude of intestinal damage are still most warranted and this research area should be prioritized. These markers could provide cut-offs for patient allocation to various treatment strategies. As a good start, a recent retrospective study assessed patients with considered low probability of bowel necrosis and undergoing first-line endovascular revascularization and identified persistent bowel wall enhancement in CT scan and C-reactive protein level < 100 mg/L as factors associated with intestinal resection-free survival in patients undergoing endovascular revascularization.

Society for Vascular Surgery chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) guidelines — patients with symptoms consistent with CMI should undergo an expedited workup, including a computed tomography arteriogram, to exclude other potential causes. The diagnosis is supported by significant arterial occlusive disease in the mesenteric vessels, particularly the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment requires revascularization with the primary target being the superior mesenteric artery. Endovascular revascularization with a balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent is the recommended initial treatment with open repair reserved for select younger patients and those who are not endovascular candidates. Long-term follow-up and surveillance are recommended after revascularization and for asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric occlusive disease. Patient with recurrent symptoms after revascularization owing to recurrent stenoses should be treated with an endovascular-first approach, similar to the de novo lesion.

What treatment is appropriate and when?

Patients with occlusive AMI need urgent intervention: first to re-establish blood flow, more specifically to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and then to resect non-viable bowel if necessary (Fig. 2). The SMA is the most important artery, and the focus is to revascularize it. Owing to the collateral arterial mesenteric network, it is rarely indicated to address both the SMA and the coeliac trunk.

### The diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112S3WV1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute mesenteric ischemia is an infrequent cause of abdominal pain in emergency department (ED) patients; however, mortality for this condition is high. Rapid diagnosis and surgery are key to survival, but presenting signs are often vague or variable, and there is no pathognomonic laboratory screening test. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature was performed to determine diagnostic test characteristics of patient symptoms, objective signs, laboratory studies, and diagnostic modalities to help rule in or out the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia in the ED.

Methods

In concordance with published guidelines for systematic reviews, the medical literature was searched for relevant articles. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) for systematic reviews was used to evaluate the overall quality of the trials included. Summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy were computed by using a random-effects model to combine studies. Those studies without data to fully complete a two-by-two table were not included in the meta-analysis portion of the project.

Results

The literature search identified 1,149 potentially relevant studies, of which 23 were included in the final analysis. The quality of the diagnostic studies was highly variable. A total of 1,970 patients were included in the combined population of all included studies. The prevalence of acute mesenteric ischemia ranged from 8% to 60%. There was a pooled sensitivity for l-lactate of 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73% to 94%) and a pooled specificity of 44% (95% CI = 32% to 55%). There was a pooled sensitivity for D-dimer of 96% (95% CI = 89% to 99%) and a pooled specificity of 40% (95% CI = 33% to 47%). For computed tomography (CT), we found a pooled sensitivity of 94% (95% CI = 90% to 97%) and specificity of 95% (95% CI = 93% to 97%). The positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for a positive CT was 17.5 (95% CI = 5.99 to 51.29), and the negative likelihood ratio (-LR) was 0.09 (95% CI = 0.05 to 0.17). The pooled operative mortality rate for mesenteric ischemia was 47% (95% CI = 40% to 54%). Given these findings, the test threshold of 2.1% (below this pretest probability, do not test further) and a treatment threshold of 74% (above this pretest probability, proceed to surgical management) were calculated.

Conclusions

The quality of the overall literature base for mesenteric ischemia is varied. Signs, symptoms, and laboratory testing are insufficiently diagnostic for the condition. Only CT angiography had adequate accuracy to establish the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia in lieu of laparotomy.

### Acute management of mesenteric emergencies: tailoring the solution to the problem [^1128s2FJ]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) constitutes a life-threatening problem that can result in death, multiorgan failure, and severe nutritional disability. Although AMI is a rare cause of acute abdominal emergencies, ranging between 1 and 2 individuals per 10,000, the morbidity and mortality rates are high. Arterial embolic etiology composes nearly one-half of AMIs, with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain considered the most common symptom. Arterial thrombosis is the second most common cause of AMI, which presents similarly to arterial embolic AMI, although often more severe due to anatomic differences. Veno-occlusive causes of AMI are the third most common and are associated with an insidious onset of vague abdominal pain. Each patient is unique, and the treatment plan should be tailored to their individual needs. This may include considering the patient's age, comorbidities, and overall health, as well as their preferences and personal circumstances. A multidisciplinary approach involving specialists from different fields, such as surgeons, interventional radiologists, and intensivists, is recommended for the best possible outcome. Potential challenges in tailoring an optimal treatment plan for AMI may include delayed diagnosis, limited availability of specialized care, or patient factors that make some interventions less feasible. Addressing these challenges requires a proactive and collaborative approach, with regular review and adjustment of the treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for each patient.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia [^113hxEkf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a relatively rare but highly lethal condition that requires emergency surgery. It is ranked as one of the most frequent causes of death among surgical diseases on a global level. The estimated incidence is 6–12 events per 100 000 person-years, and 1 patient with AMI in about every 2000 hospital admissions. The prevalence of AMI increases with age, with a median age of presentation of around 70 years, and a 10-fold higher risk in octogenarians with co-morbidities compared with the younger population. Despite progress in care, the mortality rate is reported to be between 50 and 66 per cent, even in modern series. However, focus on clinical pathways and care bundles can increase awareness, speed up diagnosis, increase revascularization rates, and improve mortality rates compared with historical cohorts.

Three surgical society guidelinesexist for AMI, each deviating slightly from the others. The deviations likely depend on both the time of guideline development (from 2016 to 2022) and the various disciplines involved (emergency, gastrointestinal, and vascular surgeons). In addition, a separate set of guidelineshas been provided by a radiology society, involving interventional radiology. Taken together, these recommendations for management highlight the emerging focus on AMI and the multidisciplinary approach to management that has evolved.

H. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is increasing, representing about 25% of AMI cases. If there is no evidence of necrosis on CT, the recommended treatment is resuscitation to improve organ perfusion, considering the possible use of vasodilators. Both papaverine and prostaglandin E1 are associated with decreased mortality and need for surgical intervention.– Early exploration is not recommended; it should be reserved for circumstances that strongly suggest full-thickness necrosis and impending perforation. With improved perfusion, even very significant ischemic changes may be reversible. However, if the patient has recalcitrant shock, exploration via laparoscopy or laparotomy is necessary to exclude necrotic intestine. It may not be clear on initial evaluation if a patient's gut is dying because of systemic critical illness or vice versa; these situations warrant discussion of goals of care before intervention.

I. Venous thrombosis makes up 10% of AMI cases. The first-line treatment is systemic anticoagulation and bowel rest. Pharmacologic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy may be useful adjuncts in patients without signs of bowel necrosis who do not have an adequate response to anticoagulation. It may be performed via percutaneous transhepatic, transjugular, or transfemoral approaches or by direct venous cannulation intraoperatively. There are no controlled studies of these techniques, and they are considered experimental at this time. Similar to patients presenting with NOMI, exploration should be undertaken only in circumstances such as persistent shock, peritonitis, or evidence of full-thickness bowel necrosis or perforation on CT.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: mesenteric ischemia [^111kRbEc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mesenteric ischemia is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed, serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of mesenteric ischemia, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Mesenteric ischemia is an abdominal vascular emergency that includes superior mesenteric arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, venous mesenteric ischemia, and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. It is associated with a variety of risk factors including older age, cardiovascular disease, hypercoagulable state, and end-stage renal disease. The presentation depends on the underlying pathophysiology. While arterial embolic disease may present with sudden, severe pain, the early stages of the disease and other forms can present with vague symptoms, including generalized abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory testing can suggest the disease with leukocytosis and elevated lactate, but normal values should not be used to exclude the diagnosis. The imaging modality of choice is triple phase computed tomography with non-contrast, arterial, and delayed phases. The initial ED management includes fluid resuscitation, symptomatic therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation. Emergent consultation with a multidisciplinary team including diagnostic and interventional radiologists and cardiovascular and general surgeons is necessary for definitive treatment.

Conclusions

An understanding of mesenteric ischemia can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia [^117TBh7n]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an abrupt decrease in blood flow results in inadequate supply to the intestines, leading to bowel infarction. Etiologies may include arterial embolus, arterial or venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. Other causes include vasculitis, traumatic injury, dissection of the aorta, cholesterol emboli, and intestinal obstruction. Mortality rates can approach 90% in the setting of bowel infarction. As such, it is important to establish an early diagnosis before the onset of bowel infarction. Treatment has traditionally involved surgical management. However, endovascular approaches have been increasingly reported in multiple case series describing success with initial endovascular therapy followed by open surgical intervention in some cases. Acuity of presentation, presence of bowel infarction, etiology of the ischemia, and risk factors may influence a planned treatment approach. The key to successful treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia involves early clinical recognition based on a detailed history and physical examination along with assessment of contributory risk factors, rapid acquisition of appropriate diagnostics to confirm a diagnosis, and early intervention to correct the underlying abnormality.

REFLECT

E. An understanding of expected outcomes and careful consideration of patient preferences and goals of care is crucial to shared decision making in patients with AMI. Many factors are associated with "poor outcomes", including tachycardia, respiratory distress, organ failure, creatinine > 1.7, lactate > 2, absent bowel wall enhancement, peritoneal effusion, and ileal or multisegment bowel involvement;, American Society of Anesthesiologists score > 3; and the need for open surgical intervention or open abdomen. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grading scale for mesenteric ischemia, based on the degree of intestinal ischemia, is useful in classifying disease severity. However, Sindall et al.were unable to correlate grades with outcomes and emphasized the fraught nature of prognostication in AMI based on presenting findings alone. Lengthy discussions about prognosis are premature and potentially counterproductive during the early (i.e. diagnosis and resuscitation) phase, as time is of the essence and the extent of vascular disease and nonsalvageable bowel may not be definitively known. However, gaining an early understanding of the patient's preferences can help to guide subsequent interventions and intraoperative decision making.

Although every effort should be made to ascertain the patient's wishes and goals of care before operative intervention, this is not always possible. When confronted with extensive intestinal necrosis, the surgeon should not hesitate to seek intraoperative consultation with surrogate decision-makers or other surgeons if there is uncertainty about how to proceed. If no surrogate is available, the surgeon must make a judgment. Extensive midgut necrosis in a frail 90-year-old with multiple-organ failure is unlikely to result in survival to hospital discharge, so it is probably appropriate to close the abdomen without resection. On the other hand, a younger healthier patient who has experienced a sudden catastrophic loss of intestine may be a candidate for small bowel transplantation or may still value life even if dependent on parenteral nutrition, so resection is likely appropriate. The surgeon needs to provide medically appropriate care but not feel compelled to pursue interventions that will not benefit the patient. Involvement of hospital ethics or appropriate care committees may be necessary or helpful prior to intervention if time allows or if the patient survives the initial operation and faces a difficult ICU stay.

Conclusion

Radiologists play a critical role in the diagnosis and appropriate triage of patients with mesenteric ischaemia. MDCT has a high specificity and sensitivity to diagnose intestinal ischaemia. Since mesenteric ischaemia may present with many different radiological appearances, an understanding of the intestinal vascular and mesenteric anatomy as well as the pathophysiology of mesenteric ischaemic disease helps improve the diagnosis of this challenging disease.

Take-home message

A key to improve management of AMI is awareness, allowing adequately raised and communicated suspicion followed by early diagnosis and treatment. CT with intravenous contrast enhancement and imaging in the arterial phase followed by early revascularization in case of arterial occlusion carries the potential to rescue the bowel, whereas early systemic treatment optimizing volume status and organ perfusion is important for all subtypes of AMI, but most crucial for NOMI. Selection of initial management requires a multidisciplinary approach and cannot be based on time alone.

### Prognostic factors for the successful conservative management of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia [^112CeMza]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), an acute mesenteric circulatory disorder without organic obstruction of the main trunk of the mesenteric artery or vein, is associated with an extremely high mortality rate of up to 80%. The pathogenesis of NOMI is characterized primarily by microcirculatory dysfunction of the intestine upon a background of systemic circulatory disorders. Several previous studies identified risk factors for the development of NOMI, including a low cardiac output state, septic or hemorrhagic shock, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs, hemodialysis, dehydration, major thoracic or abdominal surgery, and any critical illness.

While emergency laparotomy for suspected MOMI has been recommended, the clinical outcomes have not improved as we expected. Indeed, it is difficult to determine an appropriate bowel resection line by intraoperative findings due to the potentially multifocal and progressive nature of the ischemic disease. In addition, the surgical stress itself induces the releases of cytokines and catecholamines, potentially exacerbating splanchnic ischemia.

Meanwhile, there is a spectrum of severity, from mild mucosal ischemia to transmural bowel necrosis and perforation, in the manifestation of NOMI. Some previous studies showed successful outcomes of conservative treatment for the initial stages, with limited bowel wall ischemia. Nonetheless, the decision-making of conservative treatment for NOMI is challenging. Surgical exploration is often needed for the definitive diagnosis of ischemia and determination of its severity. Furthermore, a delayed decision regarding surgical treatment may compromise the chance for survival.

There have been several studies to evaluate risk factors for the development of NOMI and factors influencing the surgical outcomes. However, the criteria for the decision of non-operative management remain poorly defined. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the prognostic factors for a successful outcome in conservative treatment of NOMI.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaImaging of mesenteric ischemia [^115LL4M7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon condition resulting from decreased blood flow to the small or large bowel in an acute or chronic setting. Acute ischemia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, it is difficult to diagnose clinically. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion and prompt imaging evaluation are necessary. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is less common and typically caused by atherosclerotic occlusion or severe stenosis of at least two of the main mesenteric vessels. While several imaging examination options are available for the initial evaluation of both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia, CTA of the abdomen and pelvis is overall the most appropriate choice for both conditions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

RECOGNIZE

A. Early diagnosis of AMI can be challenging, as the symptoms often mimic other abdominal pathologies. A complete history and physical examination will help establish the differential diagnosis. Severe poorly localized midabdominal pain is a hallmark of AMI; in the absence of peritonitis on examination, this constitutes the classic "pain out of proportion to physical findings". The abrupt onset of pain is consistent with acute arterial occlusion, whereas NOMI or MVT may have a more insidious presentation. A history of postprandial pain, weight loss, and food fear is consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia, which may progress to acute arterial thrombosis. Atrial fibrillation is a common underlying etiology of embolic AMI. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is due to low cardiac output, vasoconstriction, or hypovolemia. It may be seen in hospitalized critically ill patients or in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe recent illness that might have led to sepsis or dehydration. Mesenteric venous thrombosis is typically seen in patients with one or more of Virchow's triad (stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial damage), which may be associated with diseases such as pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, portal hypertension, and liver disease; it may also be seen after splenectomy or bariatric surgery.

B. Laboratory tests are invariably obtained in patients with acute abdominal pain, but it is important to recognize that no biomarkers are adequately sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or exclude AMI. A complete blood count and comprehensive chemistry panel can help identify inflammatory and metabolic disturbances. Lactate and D-dimer tests may be helpful if they are abnormal. Lactate level is often obtained in the setting of abdominal pain or sepsis and is frequently elevated in patients with AMI; lactate > 2 mmol/L is associated with increased mortality. However, a normal lactate does not exclude AMI or obviate the need for diagnostic imaging in the appropriate clinical setting.– The D-dimer has low specificity but high sensitivity, and a normal level is reassuring but cannot be completely relied upon. Noteworthy pitfalls in laboratory testing include the findings of elevated amylase or troponin I levels. They can both be elevated in the setting of AMI and may incorrectly lead the clinician toward a diagnosis of pancreatitis or acute coronary syndrome.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia [^111XxLXX]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The classic clinical presentation of AMI is sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain without proportional physical findings such as evidence of peritonitis (e.g. guarding or rebound tenderness). Ischaemia initially affects the mucosa, causing the pain. A high level of suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis at this stage. The eventual development of signs of peritonitis usually indicates irreversible ischaemia with bowel necrosis. Other symptoms at presentation may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea with bloody stool. Septic shock may occur if the diagnosis is delayed. Acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischaemia is also common, notably in hospitalised patients.

The treatment of AMI was surgical until the development of endovascular techniques. Primary endovascular management in all patients with AMI remains controversial due to the lack of strong scientific evidence regarding outcomes and the high risk of death in AMI; however, a meta-analysis concluded that both mortality and bowel resection rates were lower with endovascular techniques than with open surgery favouring an endo-first approach in the absence of bowel necrosis. There is no existing consensus regarding a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm; thus, a multidisciplinary approach is optimal. Selection of a treatment strategy is based on the stage of ischaemic damage, notably the presence of bowel necrosis.

First-line endovascular revascularisation is currently indicated for patients with stable haemodynamics and no CT evidence of transmural necrosis or peritonitis. The main treatment goal is to restore blood flow to the ischaemic segment before transmural necrosis occurs. Ischaemia starts at the mucosa and progressively extends to the serosa, leading to transmural infarction. Irreversible intestinal damage typically occurs within 6 h in cases of complete vascular occlusion. When signs of intestinal necrosis and peritonitis are present, irreversible bowel damage is highly likely and surgery is the first-line treatment. Consequently, these signs should be viewed as contra-indications to endovascular revascularisation alone. Nonetheless, debate continues regarding the optimal management at this stage, as revascularisation is still required and improves the chances of salvaging ischaemic but non-necrotic bowel segments. The main point of contention is the relative timing of revascularisation and bowel resection. The management at this stage varies across centres, reflecting the lack of a consensus.

Background

Intestinal ischaemia refers to insufficient blood flow within the mesenteric circulation to meet the metabolic demands in the bowel. It is a potentially catastrophic entity that may require emergent intervention in the acute setting. Although the clinical signs and symptoms of intestinal ischaemia are nonspecific, CT findings can be highly suggestive in the correct clinical setting.

### Surgical management of mesenteric ischemia [^111RGgj5]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Successful management of acute mesenteric ischemia is predicated on prompt diagnosis, which still remains clinical in nature. No single radiographic test has a sensitivity or specificity reliable enough to supplant frequent and thorough physical examination and clinical judgment. Operative management requires adequate excision of clearly necrotic bowel and a high index of suspicion of borderline segments. Arterial reconstruction is best done with autogenous tissue when possible in the setting of gangrene or spillage. While diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia is far more straightforward, significant controversy still remains regarding operative management with regards to the number of vessels reconstructed, direction of the graft, and choice of conduit.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^115AqqZ4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is typically defined as a group of diseases characterized by an interruption of the blood supply to varying portions of the small intestine, leading to ischemia and secondary inflammatory changes. If untreated, this process will eventuate in life threatening intestinal necrosis. The incidence is low, estimated at 0.09–0.2% of all acute surgical admissions. Therefore, although the entity is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain, diligence is always required because if untreated, mortality has consistently been reported in the range of 50%. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are the cornerstones of modern treatment and are essential to reduce the high mortality associated with this entity. The advent of endovascular approaches in parallel with modern imaging techniques may provide new options. Thus, we believe that a current position paper from World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) is warranted, in order to put forth the most recent and practical recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of AMI. This review will address the concepts of AMI with the aim of focusing on specific areas where early diagnosis and management hold the strongest potential for improving outcomes in this disease process. Some of the key points include the prompt use of CT angiography to establish the diagnosis, evaluation of the potential for revascularization to re-establish blood flow to ischemic bowel, resection of necrotic intestine, and use of damage control techniques when appropriate to allow for re-assessment of bowel viability prior to definitive anastomosis and abdominal closure.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a group of diseases characterized by an interruption of the blood supply to varying portions of the intestine, leading to ischemia and secondary inflammatory changes. If untreated, this process may progress to life-threatening intestinal necrosis. The incidence is low, estimated at 0.09–0.2% of all acute surgical admissions, but increases with age.

Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are the cornerstones of modern treatment to reduce the high mortality associated with this entity.

C. Plain x-rays or ultrasonography have little role in diagnosing AMI. The standard for diagnosis is contrast-enhanced multidetector row computed tomographic angiography, which can diagnose and allow differentiation between intestinal ischemia subtypes. Computed tomographic angiography should be obtained without delay in patients who present with signs and symptoms highly suggestive of AMI. The optimal protocol includes nonenhanced acquisition followed by biphasic contrast-enhanced phases with a delay of 30 seconds for the arterial phase and 60 to 70 seconds for the venous phase; the optimal thickness of image acquisition is 1 to 2 mm. Multiplanar reconstruction and maximum intensity projection can help identify vessel thrombosis and reduced bowel wall enhancement. Oral contrast is discouraged, as it delays time to imaging and obscures the bowel wall. For patients with acute or chronic kidney disease or risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, computed tomographic angiography is still recommended, given the critical consequences of the diagnosis, to improve diagnostic accuracy and chances of survival.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) may be defined as a sudden interruption of the blood supply to a segment of the small intestine, leading to ischemia, cellular damage, intestinal necrosis, and eventually patient death if untreated. AMI may be non-occlusive (NOMI) or occlusive, with the primary etiology further defined as mesenteric arterial embolism (50%), mesenteric arterial thrombosis (15–25%), or mesenteric venous thrombosis (5–15%). The overall incidence is low (0.09 to 0.2% of all acute admissions to emergency departments), representing an uncommon cause of abdominal pain. Prompt diagnostic and intervention are essential to reduce the high mortality rates (50 to 80%).

There are currently no level 1 evidence to guide the evaluation and treatment of suspected AMI, and the published literature contains primarily institutional reviews, case series and personal recommendations with no clearly defined treatment guidelines.

Accordingly, this review aims to provide an update with recommendations based on the most currently accepted concepts in the management of AMI.

The current presentation evolved from the contributions of a group of experts in the field who submitted their evidence-based literature review of key points pertaining to diagnosis and management of AMI. Following preliminary preparation of these key points, a coordinated presentation was organized during the WSES World Congress, May 2017 in Campinas, Brazil. The final version has taken into account the presentations at the congress as well as pertinent group discussions and comments on the various presentations.

The grading of recommendations was evaluated (Table 1).

Table 1
Grading of recommendations

Mesenteric vascular anatomy and physiology

The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is the primary blood supply for the small bowel with some collateral flow from the celiac arterial system, via the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, as well as from the inferior mesenteric artery. Intestinal blood returns via the portal vein. The splanchnic circulation receives 15–35% of the cardiac output, depending on the feeding state, but oxygen extraction is relatively low, accounting for the oxygen delivery capacity of the portal vein to the liver. Thus, blood supply must be reduced by more than 50% before the small intestine becomes ischemic.

Furthermore, the intestines can autoregulate oxygen availability via enhanced oxygen extraction and perfusion due to vasodilation. Experimentally, it had been shown that mesenteric ischemia does not occur until the patient's mean arterial pressure is < 45 mmHg. Consequently, the small intestine is able to compensate for a 75% reduction in mesenteric blood flow for up to 12 h.

Conclusions

AMI is a serious surgical emergency. The most important message is to have a high index of suspicion based on the combination of history of abrupt onset of abdominal pain, acidosis, and organ failure. This clinical scenario should prompt imaging (CTA) in order to establish the diagnosis. In parallel with rapid resuscitation and after careful assessment of the CTA, the patient should be explored to assess bowel viability, re-establish vascular flow, and resect non-viable bowel.

In the operating room, a focus on revascularization should take priority.

Classically open revascularization approaches have been used and described, in combination with damage control laparotomy. Recent developments, with improvement in early diagnosis, have allowed endovascular techniques to be implemented. Although evidence for the impact of endovascular interventions is limited at this time, they have apparent advantages over open surgery in some patients.

Preliminary evidence suggests that treatment of AMI in especially dedicated centers using a multidisciplinary approach improves outcomes. The evaluation and treatment of these patients by an interdisciplinary team reduce the time to reperfusion as short as possible.

Mesenteric vascular insufficiency is a serious medical condition that may lead to bowel infarction, morbidity, and mortality that may approach 50%. Recommended therapy for acute mesenteric ischemia includes aspiration embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stenting for the treatment of underlying arterial stenosis. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia may respond to transarterial infusion of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1. Recommended therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia includes angioplasty with or without stent placement and, if an endovascular approach is not possible, surgical bypass or endarterectomy. The diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome is controversial, but surgical release may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. Venous mesenteric ischemia may respond to systemic anticoagulation alone. Transhepatic or transjugular superior mesenteric vein catheterization and thrombolytic infusion can be offered depending on the severity of symptoms, condition of the patient, and response to systemic anticoagulation. Adjunct transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation can be considered for outflow improvement. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

MI remains a highly lethal entity. Improving survival requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should be undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose MI earlier in its course, before irreversible damage has occurred. Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in the mortality from MI finally is occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment finally may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

The finding of massive gut necrosis requires careful assessment of the patients underlying co-morbidities and advanced directives in order to judge whether comfort carries the best treatment. (Recommendation 1C)

In cases of extensive infarction of most of the small bowel with or without a portion of the colon, the surgeon could face with a philosophical decision whether to do anything. Resection of the entire involved bowel will result in short bowel syndrome with its serious associated consequences. This may not be a preferable state, particularly in elderly infirm patients, who may not tolerate long-term parenteral nutrition. A preoperative discussion with the patient and the patient's family concerning these issues is warranted and often necessary peri-operatively as well so that an agreeable plan can be reached.

Treatment strategies may appear to be beneficial in certain populations, whereas any treatment itself is unlikely causing mortality. To address these questions, meticulous standardized reporting in future studies without subjective interpretation of results is required.

Many observational studies only summarize descriptive data without reporting the severity of illness or any adjusted comparisons. In our opinion, adding more such studies will unlikely bring any new information nor lead to progress in identifying optimal AMI management strategies based on evidence, as the patient selection process cannot be assessed. Moreover, presenting descriptive results and unadjusted analyses may even be misleading. For example, it is possible that revascularization/reperfusion of a bowel segment with already transmural damage may impair outcome, but to our knowledge, this has not been studied specifically. Accordingly, advocating the endovascular approach for the majority of patients based on results of crude analyses in studies where the groups differed at baseline may not be appropriate. The expected clear advantages of a less invasive (endovascular) over a more invasive (open surgery) approach could be lost due to patient selection. Therefore, it is of great interest to identify patient groups in whom endovascular treatment alone could be successful.
