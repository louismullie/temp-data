## Question

What combination medication and dose should I start with in primary HTN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about choosing initial combination therapy and dosing for primary hypertension, with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the patient by hypertension stage and baseline blood pressure relative to target. Then, I should verify which drug classes are first-line and which combinations are preferred. Next, I will consider when to start with monotherapy versus dual therapy, including special populations. After that, I need to specify concrete low-dose combinations and dosing, including the option of low-dose triple or quadruple therapy. Finally, I should outline monitoring, titration, and safety checks, and reconcile any conflicting evidence or guideline nuances before concluding with a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the staging framework and thresholds that drive initial therapy choices, because misclassification here will misdirect the regimen. For adults with primary hypertension, stage 1 is typically 130–139/80–89 mmHg and stage 2 is ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and most contemporary guidelines recommend initial combination therapy when baseline BP is at least 20/10 mmHg above the patient's target BP, which practically aligns with stage 2 in many cases, although targets may vary by risk and comorbidity profile [^111kNc8j] [^113m3sgA] [^116nKqcH].

> I need to check which drug classes are truly first-line and which combinations are preferred before jumping to dosing. The four core first-line classes are thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications such as HFrEF, CAD, or arrhythmias; preferred initial dual combinations pair a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACEi or ARB) with either a CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, and simultaneous use of ACEi and ARB is not recommended due to potential harm [^111kNc8j] [^113wcFJf] [^111rJjTU] [^112XTFfx] [^1112fAjs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting everyone on two drugs; I should verify when monotherapy is reasonable. In stage 1 hypertension, especially if baseline is only modestly elevated and cardiovascular risk is not high, starting with a single first-line agent and titrating or adding a second agent if needed is reasonable; exceptions where initial dual therapy is still favored include high-risk stage 1 patients, such as those with ASCVD risk > 7.5% or non-Hispanic Black adults, and in frail older adults or those with symptomatic orthostasis, dual therapy may be deferred or used cautiously [^111kNc8j] [^113JSXaD] [^116v5PnZ] [^116nKqcH].

> For stage 2 hypertension, I should confirm that dual therapy is the default starting point. The ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend initiating two first-line agents of different classes in most patients with stage 2 hypertension, ideally as a single-pill combination to improve adherence and speed control; the VA/DoD similarly suggests combination therapy when baseline is > 20/10 mmHg above goal, which operationalizes the same principle [^111kNc8j] [^1152SN5v] [^116nKqcH] [^113m3sgA].

> Now, let me think about concrete low-dose dual combinations and dosing, and I should double-check that I'm using evidence-aligned doses. Reasonable starting dual SPCs include an ARB such as telmisartan 40 mg or losartan 50 mg paired with amlodipine 5 mg, or an ARB/ACEi such as telmisartan 40 mg or lisinopril 10 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or chlorthalidone 12.5 mg; these pairings reflect guideline-preferred combinations and commonly available SPCs, and the principle is to start at or near half-standard doses of each component to maximize efficacy and tolerability [^111kNc8j] [^112XTFfx] [^111zxsTh].

> Wait, let me verify the role of low-dose triple or quadruple therapy up front, because I don't want to overgeneralize from small trials. The QUARTET randomized trial showed that starting with a quarter-dose quadruple combination (irbesartan 37.5 mg, amlodipine 1.25 mg, indapamide 0.625 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg) lowered SBP by about 7 mmHg more than standard-dose monotherapy at 12 weeks with higher control rates and sustained benefit to 12 months, and a meta-analysis of triple/quadruple low-dose combinations reported greater SBP reduction and higher control versus monotherapy or usual care with only a small increase in dizziness; however, outcome trials are lacking and this strategy is best reserved for patients with higher baseline BP or when rapid control is prioritized, with careful attention to tolerability [^11161kuM] [^111FK4gC] [^111hGaq5].

> I should confirm special population nuances before finalizing the regimen. In non-Hispanic Black adults, guidelines favor starting with a thiazide-type diuretic or a CCB, and many recommend initial dual therapy that includes one of these classes; in older adults, I need to watch for orthostatic hypotension and start low, titrating cautiously; in chronic kidney disease with albuminuria, an ACEi or ARB should be included, and dual therapy with a CCB or thiazide is appropriate, avoiding dual RAS blockade [^111kNc8j] [^1124e2kh] [^113TaGwi] [^1112fAjs].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration cadence to avoid therapeutic inertia. A practical approach is to reassess BP within 4–6 weeks, titrate components to full doses if tolerated, and if still above goal, escalate to triple therapy with ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide, ideally as an SPC; if triple therapy at maximally tolerated doses fails, add spironolactone 25–50 mg or an alternative fourth agent and consider secondary causes or referral, aligning with ESC/ESH and VA/DoD algorithms [^112anHrA] [^117YFQeQ] [^112GWY6k].

> But wait, what about the evidence base comparing initial combination versus monotherapy for hard outcomes; I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty. The Cochrane review found very low certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals and no definitive outcome advantage for initial combination over monotherapy, largely due to small samples and few events; thus, while BP-lowering and control advantages of initial combination are consistent, outcome superiority remains uncertain, reinforcing that regimen choice should balance speed of control, adherence, and patient-specific risk rather than assumed outcome differences alone [^115Q3UvG] [^113i4TjW].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability considerations so I don't inadvertently cause harm. Low-dose combinations are generally well tolerated, with a modest excess of dizziness versus monotherapy but no increase in withdrawals in pooled analyses; nonetheless, in older or frail patients, I should start low, monitor for orthostatic symptoms, and consider once-daily, long-acting formulations to smooth BP coverage and reduce adverse effects, consistent with guideline cautions in the elderly [^111FK4gC] [^111kNc8j] [^116NwUQf].

> Let me reconsider the practical bottom line and make sure it aligns with major guidelines. For most adults with stage 2 hypertension, start with two first-line agents of different classes, preferably as a single-pill combination using low-to-moderate doses, such as telmisartan 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg or losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, titrating every 4–6 weeks and escalating to triple therapy if needed; for stage 1 hypertension with modest elevation and lower risk, starting with a single agent and adding a second if not at goal is reasonable, while high-risk stage 1 patients may still benefit from initial dual therapy; reserve low-dose triple or quadruple therapy for selected cases where rapid, substantial control is prioritized and monitoring for tolerability is feasible [^111kNc8j] [^1152SN5v] [^111rJjTU] [^11161kuM].

---

For most patients with primary hypertension, **start with a low-dose, two-drug single-pill combination** [^111rJjTU] of a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic [^116nKqcH], as this achieves faster BP control [^111N7KCo], better adherence [^112b8pUZ], and fewer side effects than monotherapy [^114kFon5]. Use **half-standard doses** for each component to minimize adverse effects while maximizing efficacy [^114cPNrM] [^111FK4gC]. Reserve monotherapy for frail or elderly patients [^116v5PnZ] or those with stage 1 hypertension and low risk [^116v5PnZ]. Avoid starting with triple therapy unless the patient is at very high cardiovascular risk or has markedly elevated BP [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for combination therapy

- **Faster BP control**: Combination therapy lowers BP more rapidly than monotherapy, reducing cardiovascular risk sooner [^113gqDFC] [^111hGaq5].

- **Improved adherence**: Single-pill combinations reduce pill burden and improve adherence, a key determinant of BP control [^112b8pUZ] [^113JSXaD].

- **Fewer side effects**: Lower doses of two agents often cause fewer side effects than high-dose monotherapy, improving tolerability [^112ghtZJ] [^114kFon5].

- **Broader mechanism coverage**: Combining different classes targets multiple pathways, providing additive BP-lowering effects [^112ghtZJ].

---

## Recommended initial combination therapy

Current guidelines recommend starting with a **two-drug combination** [^111rJjTU] in most patients with primary hypertension [^116nKqcH]. The preferred combinations include:

| **Combination** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| ACE inhibitor or ARB + calcium channel blocker (CCB) | - Complementary mechanisms <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Proven cardiovascular benefit [^115CKgwF] [^111nFr95] |
| ACE inhibitor or ARB + thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic | - Effective BP reduction <br/> - Reduced risk of hypokalemia with ACEi/ARB <br/> - Proven cardiovascular benefit [^111nFr95] [^115qwZwT] |

---

## Specific drug classes and doses

Recommended **drug classes and typical low doses** for initial combination therapy:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Typical low doses** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | - 5–10 mg daily <br/> - 2.5–5 mg daily |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Telmisartan | - 25–50 mg daily <br/> - 20–40 mg daily |
| CCBs | - Amlodipine <br/> - Felodipine | - 2.5–5 mg daily <br/> - 2.5–5 mg daily |
| Thiazide diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Chlorthalidone | - 12.5–25 mg daily <br/> - 12.5–25 mg daily |

---

These doses are **lower than standard monotherapy doses** to minimize side effects while achieving additive BP lowering [^114cPNrM] [^111FK4gC].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

- **Meta-analysis**: Low-dose dual combinations reduce BP more than monotherapy without increasing adverse events [^114cPNrM].

- **QUARTET trial**: Initial quadruple quarter-dose therapy achieved greater BP reduction and control than monotherapy, with good tolerability [^11161kuM].

- **PATHWAY-1 trial**: Initial combination therapy was superior to monotherapy, with uniform efficacy across renin phenotypes [^111N7KCo].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age and frailty**: Consider monotherapy in elderly or frail patients due to higher risk of hypotension and falls [^116v5PnZ].

- **Comorbidities**: Tailor combinations to comorbidities (e.g. ACEi/ARB for CKD, beta-blockers for heart failure) [^1124e2kh].

- **Ethnicity**: In Black patients, include a thiazide diuretic or CCB due to greater efficacy [^1124e2kh] [^113TaGwi].

---

## Monitoring and titration

Reassess **BP within 2–4 weeks** [^114yMY2E]; titrate doses or add a third agent if targets are not met. Triple therapy typically includes an ACEi/ARB, a CCB, and a thiazide diuretic [^112anHrA] [^113HhyUr].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Hypotension**: Monitor for dizziness, especially in elderly or frail patients [^113JSXaD].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor potassium and renal function, particularly with diuretics or ACEi/ARB [^notfound].

- **Adverse effects**: Lower doses minimize side effects, but monitor for cough (ACEi), edema (CCB), and hyponatremia (diuretics) [^112ghtZJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial therapy**: Start with a two-drug single-pill combination of an ACEi/ARB plus a CCB or thiazide diuretic at low doses [^111rJjTU] [^116nKqcH].

- **Dosing**: Use half-standard doses for each component to balance efficacy and tolerability [^114cPNrM] [^1168AScL].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess BP in 2–4 weeks; titrate or add a third agent if needed [^111kNc8j].

- **Special populations**: Use monotherapy in elderly or frail patients; tailor combinations to comorbidities and ethnicity [^116v5PnZ] [^1124e2kh].

---

Starting with a **low-dose, two-drug single-pill combination** is the preferred initial strategy for most patients with primary hypertension, achieving faster control, better adherence, and fewer side effects than monotherapy [^111xhpHY] [^111N7KCo] [^112b8pUZ].

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113yhsam]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension — initial combination therapy considerations: Combination therapy for treating HTN is common, and the ACCOMPLISH study confirmed that combination therapy is safe and effective. In ALLHAT, only 26% of participants reached goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg) with monotherapy, and larger reductions of blood pressure (e.g., 20/10 mm Hg or more) often require at least two medications; initiating therapy with two drugs is effective and well tolerated, apart from a slight increase in dizziness incidence for some combination dosing. The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update did not identify any studies that met inclusion criteria comparing one-drug initiation with sequential titration versus two-drug initiation, but providers and patients may wish to consider combination therapy when selecting initial therapy. Initial combination therapy may reduce the number of titrations and visits to achieve blood pressure goal, patients with a compelling indication for more than one class of antihypertensive agent may benefit from initial combination therapy, and combination pills, when available, may reduce medication co-payments. Whether using sequential or initial combination therapy, providers should attempt to achieve dosing ranges that have been found to impact important clinical outcomes, recognizing that fixed-dose combination therapy may not always be available or prescribed.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^115uEuV7]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

International guidelines consider most antihypertensive medication (AHM) classes as equivalent options for treating primary hypertension. However, limited research has examined whether general practitioners (GPs) share this view or have specific prescribing preferences. Understanding GPs' perspectives is crucial for identifying how guidelines are implemented in daily practice. This study explores the perspectives, preferences, and prescribing practices of Dutch GPs regarding AHM classes in patients with primary hypertension who have no cardiovascular comorbidities or diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews among Dutch GPs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed.

Results

We interviewed 18 Dutch GPs (56% female) and identified three key themes: contextual factors when initiating treatment, preferences for AHM classes, and considerations on combination therapy. GPs consider lifestyle modifications, patient age, and initial blood pressure (BP) when deciding on treatment. Most GPs do not view all AHM classes as interchangeable, with their preferences shaped by perceived efficacy, side effects, and patient-specific factors, including ethnicity and patient preferences. GPs often favour a gradual titration approach, starting with one class before adjusting the dosage or adding another.

Conclusion

GPs adopt a multifaceted, patient-centred approach to hypertension, prioritizing lifestyle interventions and weighing short-term risks against long-term benefits. We identified several discrepancies between guideline recommendations and everyday practice-particularly regarding the perceived non-equivalence of AHM classes and limited support for initiating combination therapy. Incorporating GPs' perspectives into guideline development may lead to more practical, tailored recommendations that improve adherence and patient outcomes in real-world care.

### Initial single-pill blood pressure-lowering therapy: should It Be for most people? [^114kFon5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The authors assert that neither the STITCH trial nor the meta‐analyses evaluating adverse events on combination therapy have changed practice patterns. MacDonald and colleagues 16 should appreciate, however, that most guidelines around the world advocate for initial combinations of BP‐lowering therapies when BP is > 20/10 mm Hg higher than the goal or ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. 25, 26, 27 In addition, initial single‐pill combinations in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk have demonstrated cardiovascular outcome benefits in randomized trials. 2 Many physicians practice what they were taught in training. Most are not exposed to initial single‐pill combination therapy because their choice of therapy is based on hospital or clinic formularies, which often lack or have limited options of BP‐lowering combination medications, mainly because of their higher cost. 28

Paradoxically, one of the major reasons they are taught to avoid combination medications is their potential for adverse events. Although there are no differences in adverse events if single and combination therapy are similar doses, similar to the authors' findings, if BP was not controlled by monotherapy and dosage increased, all classes have increased adverse effects over the combinations in almost all published data. 25, 29

All single‐pill combinations available and approved by the Food and Drug Administration have demonstrated added BP‐lowering efficacy with fewer adverse events compared with individual higher‐dosed components of the combination. 1 A detailed discussion of initial single‐pill combinations and their efficacy for reduction of BP and cardiovascular events is presented in the American Society of Hypertension Consensus Report. 25 Combinations of renin‐angiotensin system blockers with either thiazide‐like diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred initial therapy if BP is > 20/10 mm Hg higher than the goal BP. These specific combinations were chosen because they have good evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction and data on slowed progression of chronic kidney disease, while providing fewer adverse events compared with high doses of individual monotherapy approaches. 25

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy can be recommended for patients with BP > 150/95 mm Hg.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^114MwXF8]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

When asked whether they routinely followed the guideline recommendation to add a second antihypertensive class — rather than increasing the dose of the initial drug — when BP introduced another class, either due to their own preference or that of the patient. This was often because some GPs started with a marginally effective dosage to assess tolerance, opting to increase the dose before considering a second class.

Well, it depends a bit. Often, we start by increasing the dose and then add something. Monotherapy is often more acceptable to the patient than starting multiple medications at once. To be honest, I wouldn't want to take two tablets every day either if I could manage with just one. (GP15)

One of the upcoming changes in the Dutch hypertension guideline at the time was the recommendation to initiate dual-class antihypertensive therapy in patients with elevated initial BP values (≥ 150 mmHg). When discussing this proposed update, GPs generally acknowledged that a single AHM class would likely be insufficient in cases of very high initial BP. However, only a few stated that they already initiated or intended to initiate treatment with two classes simultaneously. Most expressed a preference to start with one class and then, after a few weeks, evaluate the need for a second, aligning well with the continuity of care in primary care settings.

I think few GPs are accustomed to initiating two classes at the same time; at least, I don't see this happening any time soon in my workplace. (GP17)

No, I've never done that. If the blood pressure is very high and doesn't decrease with the first antihypertensive medication after a week to ten days, then I might quickly add a second one. (GP8)

Concerns about a rapid BP decline causing more side effects, potentially negatively affecting adherence, also influenced this approach.

If you prescribe too many AHM, someone might collapse, and then treatment adherence is completely lost. I'll have them return a bit sooner. (GP16)

Additionally, starting with one class makes it easier to identify side effects.

No, I actually never do that. Because if there are side effects, you won't know exactly which medication is causing them. (GP17)

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^114BZaic]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy of hypertension with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill offers the potential to lower blood pressure more quickly, obtain target blood pressure, and decrease adverse effects. Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset adverse reactions from each other, such as a diuretic decreasing edema occurring secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions. Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of "compelling indications" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers. Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with increased risk of coronary disease includes a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or calcium channel blocker. The Joint National Committee guidelines recommend beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients who are postmyocardial infarction; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease; and diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for recurrent stroke prevention in patients with hypertension.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

Methods

We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

Results

Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. Majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control. On average, STPs scored a performance of 68% on the HEARTS Checklist.

Conclusion

Several STPs are available globally; however, most of them have enormous scope for improvement through interventions aimed at alignment with the latest evidence-based guidelines and multistakeholder engagement.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^112ghtZJ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) remains the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease globally. Despite this, only 1 in 3 people with hypertension achieve BP targets < 140/90 mm Hg in high-income countries, and < 1 in 10 in middle- and low-income countries. Therefore, there remains a pressing need for better BP-lowering strategies. Emerging evidence indicates that single pill low-dose combinations (LDCs) of 3 or 4 BP-lowering therapies ("hypertension polypills") could be used as an early treatment strategy for hypertension. This concept is based on the rationale that most of the BP-lowering efficacy from an antihypertensive is achieved at a fraction of the full dose and that the BP reductions are additive when using different drug classes. Meanwhile, adverse drug effects from antihypertensives appear to be more dose dependent, meaning that the use of multiple low doses to achieve BP control is less likely to induce side effects compared to the common practice of increasing the dose when BP targets are not met. The increase in efficacy from adding another low-dose BP-lowering drug makes LDCs a particularly attractive treatment option that maximizes efficacy while minimizing adverse events.

A prior systematic review and meta-analysis including 7 trials demonstrated that LDCs are associated with an average of 18 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP (SBP) compared to placebo and 7 mm Hg reduction in SBP compared to usual care, with a slight increase in dizziness. Since then, several new trials of LDCs have been published, allowing more detailed comparisons to address unanswered questions. For example, whether the effects of LDC vary by pretreatment BP is unclear, which is important given recent recommendations to initiate or intensify treatment at lower BP levels in many patients. There is also uncertainty about how much additional BP lowering is achieved with LDC compared to monotherapy, which remains the most common treatment strategy globally. Finally, there is debate regarding the timing for use of LDCs in management of hypertension. Specifically, should LDC be used in already treated patients with uncontrolled BP or in the initial stages of treatment, or in both settings? Therefore, we aimed to assess the BP-lowering efficacy and safety of LDC BP-lowering drugs that contain 3 or 4 drug classes compared to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in randomized clinical trials.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of initial treatment with single-pill combination antihypertensive medications [^1168AScL]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension guidelines recommend initiating treatment with single pill combination (SPC) antihypertensive medications, but SPCs are used by only one-third of treated hypertensive US adults. This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of initial treatment with SPC dual antihypertensive medications compared with usual care monotherapy in hypertensive US adults. The validated BP Control Model-Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model simulated initial SPC dual therapy (two half-standard doses in a single pill) compared with initial usual care monotherapy (half-standard dose when baseline systolic BP < 20mmHg above goal and one standard dose when ≥ 20mmHg above goal). Secondary analyses examined equivalent dose monotherapy (one standard dose) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (two half-standard doses). The primary outcomes were direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 10 years from a US healthcare sector perspective. At 10 years, initial dual drug SPC was projected to yield 0.028 (95%UI 0.008 to 0.051) more QALYs at no greater cost ($73, 95%UI -$1 983 to $1 629) than usual care monotherapy. In secondary analysis, SPC dual therapy was cost-effective vs. equivalent dose monotherapy (ICER $8 000/QALY gained) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (ICER $57 000/QALY gained). At average drug prices, initiating antihypertensive treatment with SPC dual therapy is more effective at no greater cost than usual care initial monotherapy and has the potential to improve BP control rates and reduce the burden of CVD in the US.

### Efficacy and safety of dual combination therapy of blood pressure-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114cPNrM]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of dual combination of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL were searched until August 2017 for randomized, double-blind trials of dual combination therapy vs. monotherapy in adults with hypertension who were either treatment naïve or untreated for at least 4 weeks. Regimens were classified with reference to usual daily 'standard-dose'; for example, < 1+ < 1 for a combination of two drugs both at less than one standard-dose. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis.

Results

Thirty-three trials (13095 participants) with mean baseline mean BP 155/100mmHg were included. Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, dual combinations of < 1+ < 1, 1+ < 1 and 1+1 (i.e. low-to-standard dose), showed a dose-response relationship in reducing SBP [mean differences (95% confidence interval) of 2.8 (1.6–4.0), 4.6 (3.4–5.7) and 7.5 (5.4–9.5)mmHg, respectively], and in improving BP control [risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval) 1.11 (0.92–1.34), 1.25 (1.16–1.35) and 1.42 (1.27–1.58), respectively]. Withdrawals due to adverse events were uncommon with low-to-standard dose dual combinations, with no significant difference compared with standard-dose monotherapy [2.9 vs. 2.2%; RR 1.28 (0.85 to 1.92)]. There were fewer data for higher dose dual combinations, which did not appear to produce substantial additional efficacy and could potentially be less tolerable.

Conclusion

Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, initiating treatment with low-to-standard dose dual combination therapy is more efficacious without increasing withdrawals due to adverse events.

Uptitration of treatment to three-drug combination therapy — two-drug combination therapy will control blood pressure (BP) in approximately two-thirds of patients; for patients whose BP is not controlled by two-drug therapy, the logical option is escalation to three-drug therapy, usually a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic. Studies suggest that a three-drug combination should control BP in ≥ 80% of patients. The guideline states, We do not recommend three-drug combinations as initial therapy.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously. In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^111hGaq5]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of single pill LDCs as an initial or early treatment strategy for high BP. LDCs were superior to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in reducing BP and improving BP control (Central Illustration). Comparisons with placebo revealed that the degree of BP reduction increased substantially with the extent of BP elevation at baseline, that is, the same initial LDC among people with high baseline SBP will confer a much larger BP reduction than among those with only mildly elevated BP — a form of "autotitration". LDCs were also well tolerated, with only a small excess of dizziness compared to monotherapy and placebo but no increase in treatment withdrawals due to adverse events.

Comparisons of Low-Dose Combinations Vs Placebo, Monotherapy, and Usual Care

Abbreviation as in Figure 1.

Current guidelines recommend monotherapy or, increasingly, dual combination therapy as the initial treatment option for most people with hypertension and reserve the addition of more drug classes if patients remain uncontrolled on treatment. LDCs with 3 or 4 different drug classes have the theoretical advantage of increased BP-lowering efficacy with minimal increase in adverse events. The BP-lowering effects of different antihypertensive classes are additive and most of the BP-lowering effects occur at low dosage, while the adverse effects are proportional to the dosage of the individual drug components. The present study expands the evidence basis for the use of LDC for initial or early treatment of hypertension. These results suggest that starting with LDC compared to an initial monotherapy strategy will achieve BP targets in 1.5 times more people at first follow-up visit. LDC remained superior to usual care strategy involving clinician-guided treatment intensification, with 80% of patients achieving BP control at final follow-up compared to 65% of patients in the usual care arm. These findings highlight that standard protocols and treatment approaches with initial monotherapy do not "catch up" to upfront LDC use. Therefore, upfront use of LDCs can simplify treatment and reduce time patients remain with uncontrolled BP, which increases time in target BP and reduces cumulative BP exposure, all metrics strongly associated with less risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115wkfzb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) are characterized as follows: Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy". Initial combination therapy "is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control", and "in general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that "low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together" reduce BP more than monotherapy "over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". Observational data note that "SPCs have fewer cardiovascular events and all-cause deaths than those on equivalent multiple-pill combination therapy", and in older patients "BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored… because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop". Supportive text also states that, for appropriate candidates, "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence".

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^114iinKP]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2018 European guidelinewent on proposing that the combination of medications targeting multiple mechanisms, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin system and inducing vasodilatation and diuresis, reduces the heterogeneity of the BP responses to initial treatment and provides a steeper dose response than is observed with escalating doses of monotherapy. Whereas this might be true during first 6 months after starting BP-lowering treatment, this certainly does not apply to the long-term life course treatment of hypertension (Figure 1). A post hoc analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation Trial did not confirm the widely promoted notion in SPC publications that earlier short-term differences in BP lowering over the long run would reduce cardiovascular end points. Furthermore, the Europeanand InternationalSocieties of Hypertension instructions ignored that the association of multiple drugs in a single pharmaceutical formulation may have effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each and every individual component and may lead to undesired interactions between components. The trials,– and observational studies – reviewed in this debate article were generally not powered or had a duration not long enough to highlight serious adverse effects. As demonstrated by an observational study of patients aged 50 years or more and reflecting a real-world setting, use of SPCs was associated with a greater risk of hypotension than titrated SD free combinations. Moreover, abstraction made of commonly attributable adverse effects, for example, leg edema or cough respectively on treatment with CCBs or ACE inhibitors, many drug-induced complaints are vaguer and more difficult to be picked up, such as for instance fatigue or dizziness and in theory require rechallenge with the SD components of an SPC to identify the culprit drug. Fewer pills to be taken daily is a central concept in the promotion of SPCs, but a literature review with as search terms "preference" AND "patient" AND "pills" or "SPC", ran on October 20, 2020, with no limitations, did not yield any article among the 46 hits that directly translated patient convenience into preference for SPCs in primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. As a corollary, treatment-experienced persons living with HIV valued minimizing side-effects and long-term toxicities over dosing and administration characteristics. Preferences varied widely, highlighting the need to elicit individual patient preferences, when decisions about dosing schemes of medications are made, certainly in the light of the potential adverse events of SPCs as mentioned before. Finally, the advice to initiate antihypertensive drug therapy with SPCs also goes against pathophysiological principles supporting the use of TDs in low-renin hypertension, Blacks and older patients and the use vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or CCBs) in high-renin patients or younger individuals (Figure 3).

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^116QTabG]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

GPs navigate a multifaceted, patient-centred decision-making process in managing primary, uncomplicated hypertension, prioritizing lifestyle interventions while balancing short-term risks — such as medicalization, potential side effects, and non-adherence — against long-term cardiovascular benefits. This study identified several discrepancies between clinical practice and guideline recommendations, particularly regarding the perceived non-equivalence of AHM classes and the reluctance to initiate hypertension treatment with combination therapy, which GPs neither supported nor consistently followed. Acknowledging healthcare professionals' perspectives in updating hypertension guidelines may enhance adherence while still promoting new evidence. Further qualitative research, for instance further zooming in on GP's views on combination therapy, could help bridge the gap between guidelines and real-world practice, leading to more tailored recommendations that enhance adherence and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^111pnWQf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Two independent reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) performed an updated systematic literature search in PubMed and Medline from the date of the last systematic review in September 2022 until September 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials of hypertension polypills vs placebo, monotherapy, or usual care. Trials were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) randomized clinical trial; 2) compared LDC to placebo, monotherapy, or usual care; and 3) reported data to calculate BP differences between the treatment groups. Abstracts without accompanying full-text publications and trials of combination antihypertensives that did not meet our definition of a hypertension polypill were excluded. We defined a LDC as: 1) 3 or more antihypertensive drugs from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 hypertension guideline recommendations for antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor II blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics); 2) all included antihypertensives at less than 1 standard dose; and 3) contained in a single pill. Standard doses were defined using methods from Bennett et al. Two reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) independently reviewed the articles and extracted data on study details and study outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by review and discussion. Missing SDs of BP were imputed using a stepwise approach as per the Cochrane handbook. Authors of the original manuscripts were contacted for key missing data.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was the between-group difference in mean change in clinic SBP. Secondary outcomes were between-group difference in mean change in clinic diastolic BP (DBP), proportion of participants achieving the SBP/DBP target < 140/90 mm Hg, and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events, including withdrawals due to adverse effects. We assessed the outcomes at first follow-up visit (between 4 and 12 weeks) between LDC and placebo/monotherapy to obtain the best estimate of the true treatment effect before any treatment escalation or de-escalation occurred. If a trial included a comparator arm with usual care and all patients were on monotherapy at first follow-up, then we included this trial in the comparison of LDC vs monotherapy. We also separately compared the efficacy of LDC vs usual care with physician-directed intensification at the final follow-up visit to confirm whether usual care eventually catches up to an initial LDC strategy in terms of hypertension control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115nymPL]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment prioritizes early combination therapy and stepwise intensification: Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy. Preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or diuretic. Other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations (e.g. angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control). It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC). Exceptions are frail older patients and those at low risk and grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP is < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found a large average difference in HSBP in favor of initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. It was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), by margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic BP. Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co–primary end point of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluation of the never‐catch‐up hypothesis that initial less intense BP control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. 7, 10 In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination. A unique feature of PATHWAY‐1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force‐titrated dose was compared with combination therapy. Several clear‐cut, connected findings emerged. First, we established that among the baseline predictors of BP response to each drug, plasma renin provided a measure with substantial and significant differences in response to losartan and HCTZ between the outer tertiles (BP lowering by HCTZ was greatest in the low‐renin tertile and by losartan in the high‐renin tertile). Second, and in marked contrast to the monotherapy responses, with combination therapy, BP reduction did not vary among tertiles of renin or with other predictors. The important practical inference is that initial combination is not only effective but uniformly effective, reducing the heterogeneity in response — as illustrated by the 97% responder and 75% control rates (Table S3), with odds ratios of 8 and 5 compared with monotherapy. Third, as graphically illustrated in Figure 3 C, initial combination therapy is not only uniformly effective and superior to monotherapy but is uniformly superior to personalized monotherapy, whether achieved by prediction of each patient's best drug or by systematic crossover between the options. Even if, within the environment of a trial — with its forced dose‐drug titrations and fixed visit appointments — BP in the monotherapy arm caught up with initial combination by 32 weeks, it is reasonable to suggest the marked advantage for everyday practice of a regimen that achieves target BP in the shortest possible time and the least number of visits.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to use drugs from the five major drug classes, including ACEis, ARBs, β-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and their combinations, as the basis for antihypertensive treatment strategies to reduce BP and cardiovascular events.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Implementation of the 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care: the HYPEDIA study [^114Ygh4j]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Another interesting finding is the relatively frequent use of drug monotherapy for treatment initiation in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. These data are somewhat in contrast to the 2018 ESC/ESH strategy recommending two-drug combination therapy at first step for most patients aged < 80 years with systolic BP ≥ 150 mmHg. These findings might reflect suspected white-coat reaction in some cases and hesitance of the doctors to decide, or clinical inertia. Real life data from a large population-based cohort in Italy showed that a significant number of patients who received initial monotherapy failed to move to combination treatment, as recommended by the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines, highlighting considerable therapeutic inertia in primary care. This is highly important since randomized-based trial evidence suggests that antihypertensive combination treatment of any complexity (up to three or more drugs) is more protective compared to no-treatment or less-complex treatment. On the other hand, in 10% of patients, their doctors initiated therapy with a 3-drug combination and in fact 3 primary care doctors adopted this strategy in 80–100% of their patients. Although the doses of the drugs were not available and low-dose combinations might have been used, this aggressive strategy is not supported by the 2018 guidelines. While it is expected to lead to faster and better control rates, it might result in overtreatment with excessive BP decline and its associated adverse effects.

A large proportion of treated patients in the current study presented with uncontrolled hypertension based on office BP, thus failing to reach the ESC/ESH recommended BP targets. It is also important to note that demographic characteristics such as male sex and higher BMI, which add cardiovascular risk, were associated with higher probability of uncontrolled hypertension. Although the ESC/ESH guidelines emphasize the important role of out-of-office BP measurements in the management of hypertension, reality is that in many patients in primary care the management of hypertension is based solely on office BP. Moreover, the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines recommend a stricter BP target goal for patients < 65 years (< 130/80 mmHg). In this study, despite the high rate of uncontrolled hypertension, therapeutic decision to modify treatment, was taken in only about half of the uncontrolled patients. In addition, a considerable number of doctors used less strict BP goals compared with that of the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines. All the above findings indicate suboptimal implementation of the ESC/ESH guidelines which is attributed to several factors, probably related to inadequate patients' adherence and physicians' therapeutic inertia in achieving optimal hypertension control.

Pharmacological treatment — For hypertension: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

Methods

Setting

The British Hypertension Society Research Network of academic investigators recruited participants from both primary and secondary care.

Study Design

Patients who were aged 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, who had systolic BP > 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 95 mm Hg, and who were either never treated or who had received 1 drug class in the previous year were eligible for inclusion in PATHWAY‐1. This was a parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, phase 4 trial conducted in 11 secondary and 2 primary care centers in the United Kingdom. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1.

Participants were enrolled between February 2010 to November 2013; the study ended (last patient completed the study) in December 2014. The study design and rationale have been published. 13 A study schematic is shown in Figure 1 (a more detailed diagram is shown in Figure S1).

Figure 1
Schematic of the study showing drug administration in each of the 3 phases. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; HSBP, home systolic blood pressure.

After a 4‐week, single‐blind, placebo run‐in during which any previous antihypertensive monotherapy was withdrawn, there were 3 sequential phases of active treatment during which investigators and participants were blinded to the initial random assignment. In the first phase, weeks 0–16, half of the participants started monotherapy with either losartan or HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide), and half started a combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the second phase (weeks 16–32), all participants received the same combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the third phase, patients received additional open‐label medication with amlodipine and/or doxazosin, dependent on whether their BP was controlled and whether they tolerated the amlodipine. The primary end points were measured at the end of the second phase; the third phase allowed extended assessment of the sustained effect of the difference in randomly assigned drugs in the first phase without withholding clinically desirable treatment escalation.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

Pharmacotherapy for hypertension — combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and, therefore, minimize adverse drug effects, but clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether specific combinations and doses are more effective than a maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence; trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in essential HTN, and in RHT, future studies with long-term follow-up that would allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a fourth-line agents for RHT.

Results

We screened 796 patients and randomized 605 participants, 301 to initial monotherapy and 304 to initial combination therapy; the intention‐to‐treat analysis included 287 and 299 participants, respectively, in these 2 groups (Figure 2).

Figure 2

Note that withdrawn participants include some patients who completed the protocol but had major protocol deviations or who had incomplete data for the primary outcome. "Withdrawn" equals not eligible for per protocol analysis. The breakdown of withdrawals is shown in Table S3. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide.

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants in the study and indicates that the participants receiving combination therapy were similar to those in each monotherapy arm.

Table 1
Patient Demographics at Baseline

The mean adjusted change in HSBP from baseline over weeks 0 to 32 was −19.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −20.7 to −18.7) in the initial combination group, and −14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, −15.8 to −13.8) across the monotherapy group (Figure 3 A and Table 2). The difference between groups (the primary end point) was −4.9 mm Hg (95% CI, −6.0 to −3.7) and was significant at P < 0.001 in favor of combination therapy, permitting testing of the second hierarchical primary end point prespecified in the protocol. At the end of phase 2, the mean adjusted reduction in HSBP from baseline was −22.2 mm Hg (95% CI, −23.6 to −20.8) in the initial combination group and −23.4 mm Hg (95% CI, −24.8 to −22.0) in participants receiving initial monotherapy. The difference between groups for this hierarchical primary end point was +1.2 mm Hg (95% CI, +2.8 to −0.4; P = 0.1). Clinic systolic BP largely mirrored the home BP readings (Table 2); of note was the > 10‐mm Hg lower clinic BP in those on combination therapy averaged over phase 1. Table S2 shows the home and clinic BP data split by study week, and Table S3 shows data split by morning and evening home BP readings. The BP‐lowering effects of medication were similar or lower in the evening, suggesting that the trial medication lowered BP throughout the day.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115mfqqb]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment strategy for hypertension — contributors to poor blood pressure (BP) control and proposed approach: Only ~40% of patients with hypertension are treated and, of these, only ~35% are controlled to a BP of < 140/ 90 mmHg; evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) shows BP control can be achieved in most recruited patients and that no more than 5–10% exhibit resistance to the selected regimen; treatment inertia contributes to suboptimal BP control with many patients remaining on monotherapy and/or suboptimal doses; adherence is a much more important factor than previously recognised; almost all patients in RCTs have required combinations of drugs, and non‑adherence rises with pill burden, being usually < 10% with a single pill, ~20% with two pills, and ~40% with three pills, with very high rates in those receiving four or more pills; consequently, the most effective evidence‑based strategy is one that encourages combination treatment in most patients, enables the use of SPC therapy for most patients, encourages adherence, and follows a simple, pragmatic algorithm with SPC therapy as initial therapy in most patients except those with BP in the high–normal range and in frail older patients.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116prsA7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

These findings make a strong case for considering initial combination therapy to be more effective than current practice. Moreover, they are supported by prospective, double‐blind data to combat the other main factor blocking uptake of initial combination: concern about adverse events. There was no difference in the overall rate between groups. The slight excess in phase 1 of symptoms associated with better BP reduction did not lead to an excess of withdrawals from the initial combination group.

These aspects demarcate PATHWAY‐1 from the shorter term, largely commercial studies comparing components of fixed‐dose combinations, undertaken for registration of the combinations. Most of these studies used lower relative doses of one or both components than we did, and none provided participants with the opportunity to receive both components at maximal dose and to be compared both with matched patients starting on combination and with their own subsequent response to the combination. Two larger and longer term studies are sometimes cited to support the value of initial combination: the prospective cluster‐randomized STITCH (Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension) study and retrospective Wald meta‐analysis. 19, 20 Neither, however, has led to a change in practice, probably because of the limitations imposed by cluster randomization and retrospective analysis and because neither could address the question of adverse events. The STITCH study authors considered that superior BP reduction by initial combination in their study was attributable to their use of fixed‐dose combinations (largely different from the individual drugs used in their initial monotherapy arm) and, consequently, better adherence. Our study was not intended to address this issue but incidentally appears to refute it because average HSBP of the 300 patients in the initial combination arm was virtually identical at 16 and 32 weeks (130.0 and 130.2 mm Hg, respectively) when they were receiving losartan 100 mg and HCTZ 25 mg as separate or single tablets.

### Evaluation of recent fixed-dose combination therapies in the management of hypertension [^115CKgwF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Control of hypertension remains sub-optimal with only half of patients achieving adequate control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend initial use of two antihypertensive agents in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This review discusses the drug combinations that have additive effects and those that do not provide additional benefit while increasing the adverse events.

Recent Findings

Results from late-breaking trials have shown that combinations of a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are superior to a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for reducing cardiovascular events. Additionally, in patients with vascular disease with relatively 'controlled' blood pressure at baseline, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints compared with either monotherapy and modestly increased the incidence of adverse effects.

Summary

Combination therapy of antihypertensive agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretics) as initial therapy in stage 2 hypertension can lead to markedly improved blood pressure control in patients compared with monotherapeutic regimens.

Step 2: Select a standard hypertension treatment protocol

The choice of antihypertensive medications can vary by country, based on the population served, the availability of medications in the region, and medication prices. Simple drug- and dose-specific treatment protocols support efficient and standardized care, enable task sharing, and improve medication adherence. Simple protocols also improve medication demand forecasting, streamline procurement and supply chains, and may lead to medication price reductions by facilitating consolidated bulk procurements of protocol medications.

Step 2A: Convene a consensus conference to discuss and agree upon a drug- and dose-specific protocol

To reach consensus on the drugs, doses, and steps in a simple treatment protocol, convene stakeholders at a consensus conference at the national or subnational level. This allows stakeholders to discuss various protocol options and agree on the best protocol for their country, province, or state. Protocol prototypes should detail specific medication name and dosage at each step, and the schedule for intensifying or adding medications if BP is not controlled. The protocol should be as simple as possible, in linear design with no (or few) branch points to make it easy to for all health worker cadres to follow at the primary health care level.

The 2021 WHO Guideline for the Pharmacological Treatment of Hypertension in Adults recommends a hypertension treatment protocol that initiates treatment with a calcium channel blocker or a single pill, dual-drug combination of a calcium channel blocker, and angiotensin receptor blocker. Both of these WHO-recommended treatment protocols either introduce sequentially or combine a calcium channel blocker amlodipine, an angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan, then, if needed add a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic. All together, these three medicines — calcium channel blocker, renin-angiotensin system blocker, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic — represent the major classes of drugs recommended by experts for effective hypertension control. The specific medications can be replaced by alternate medications at equivalent potency doses from the same drug classes, especially when single pill combination medications are available. For example, if a single pill double- or triple-drug combination (of a calcium channel blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, with or without a thiazide diuretic) is available in the program setting, one of these can be substituted for the free-dose equivalents of the same drugs (Fig. 2). Where applicable, medicines and BP devices included in guidance should also be included in the country's essential medicines list and essential diagnostics list.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112zkx4m]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment strategy states that among all antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are indicated as the basis of therapy because they have demonstrated effective reduction of BP and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials. Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy, and preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic, though other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control. It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC), with exceptions for frail older patients and those at low risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by the addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose triple and quadruple combination pills vs monotherapy, usual care, or placebo for the initial management of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FK4gC]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Low-dose combination (LDC) antihypertensives consisting of 3 or 4 blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs have emerged as a potentially important therapy for the initial management of hypertension.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of LDC therapies for the management of hypertension.

Data Sources

PubMed and Medline were searched from date of inception until September 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing LDC consisting of 3 or 4 BP-lowering drugs compared to either monotherapy, usual care, or placebo.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted by 2 independent authors and synthesized using both random and fixed-effects models using risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between LDC and monotherapy, usual care, or placebo. Other outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients achieving BP less than 140/90 mm Hg, rates of adverse effects, and treatment withdrawal.

Results

Seven trials with a total of 1918 patients (mean [mean range] age, 59 [50–70] years; 739 [38%] female) were included. Four trials involved triple-component LDC and 3 involved quadruple-component LDC. At 4 to 12 weeks follow-up, LDC was associated with a greater mean reduction in SBP than initial monotherapy or usual care (mean reduction, 7.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, 4.3–10.5) and placebo (mean reduction, 18.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 15.1–20.8). LDC was associated with a higher proportion of participants achieving BP less than 140/90 mm Hg at 4 to 12 weeks compared to both monotherapy or usual care (66% vs 46%; RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.27–1.52) and placebo (54% vs 18%; RR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.93–4.77). There was no significant heterogeneity between trials enrolling patients with and without baseline BP-lowering therapy. Results from 2 trials indicated LDC remained superior to monotherapy or usual care at 6 to 12 months. LDC was associated with more dizziness (14% vs 11%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00–1.63) but no other adverse effects nor treatment withdrawal.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings in the study showed that LDCs with 3 or 4 antihypertensives were an effective and well-tolerated BP-lowering treatment option for the initial or early management of hypertension.

Study Limitations

First, we pooled together trials with different combinations of antihypertensives, which may have partly contributed to the heterogeneity between trials. However, the total standard dose of each LDC did not explain underlying heterogeneity in BP reduction. Some analyses may be underpowered to detect a difference in adverse events and there were differences in follow-up duration between studies. Further studies of LDCs in different patient populations would be important to determine if differences in tolerability exist. This study was not powered to investigate for clinical event reduction, although the relationship between BP reduction and reduction in major cardiovascular events and death is well established. Finally, this analysis was pooled using study-level data, and more precise estimates of the relationship between pretreatment BP and expected treatment efficacy may be obtained with individual patient meta-analyses.

In conclusion, LDCs in the form of 3 or 4 antihypertensives at less than standard dose are an effective and well-tolerated option for the initial management of hypertension. LDCs offer a "single step" solution that reliably achieves BP target in two-thirds of patients at first follow-up visit and remain superior to usual care that involve clinician-guided uptitration of therapy. Finally, BP reduction with LDCs was associated with trial level pretreatment BP, with greater BP reductions observed in higher grades of hypertension compared to lower or mildly elevated BP.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL SKILLS: In patients with hypertension, low-dose combinations consisting of 3 or 4 antihypertensives each at low dose are well tolerated and associated with significantly greater reductions in BP compared to an initial monotherapy and usual care. The BP reduction of low-dose combinations are highly dependent on their pretreatment BP, with smaller reductions in BP observed in individuals with only mildly elevated BP.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other combinations of antihypertensives and the use of low-dose combinations as an initial treatment option in different patient populations.

### Initial treatment with a single pill containing quadruple combination of quarter doses of blood pressure medicines versus standard dose monotherapy in patients with hypertension (QUARTET): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial [^11161kuM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment inertia is a recognised barrier to blood pressure control, and simpler, more effective treatment strategies are needed. We hypothesised that a hypertension management strategy starting with a single pill containing ultra-low-dose quadruple combination therapy would be more effective than a strategy of starting with monotherapy.

Methods

QUARTET was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial among Australian adults (≥ 18 years) with hypertension, who were untreated or receiving monotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to either treatment, that started with the quadpill (containing irbesartan at 37·5 mg, amlodipine at 1·25 mg, indapamide at 0·625 mg, and bisoprolol at 2·5 mg) or an indistinguishable monotherapy control (irbesartan 150 mg). If blood pressure was not at target, additional medications could be added in both groups, starting with amlodipine at 5 mg. Participants were randomly assigned using an online central randomisation service. There was a 1:1 allocation, stratified by site. Allocation was masked to all participants and study team members (including investigators and those assessing outcomes) except the manufacturer of the investigational product and one unmasked statistician. The primary outcome was difference in unattended office systolic blood pressure at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure control (standard office blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg), safety, and tolerability. A subgroup continued randomly assigned allocation to 12 months to assess long-term effects. Analyses were per intention to treat. This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12616001144404, and is now complete.

Findings

From June 8, 2017, to Aug 31, 2020, 591 participants were recruited, with 743 assessed for eligibility, 152 ineligible or declined, 300 participants randomly assigned to intervention of initial quadpill treatment, and 291 to control of initial standard dose monotherapy treatment. The mean age of the 591 participants was 59 years (SD 12); 356 (60%) were male and 235 (40%) were female; 483 (82%) were White, 70 (12%) were Asian, and 38 (6%) reported as other ethnicity; and baseline mean unattended office blood pressure was 141 mm Hg (SD 13)/85 mm Hg (SD 10). By 12 weeks, 44 (15%) of 300 participants had additional blood pressure medications in the intervention group compared with 115 (40%) of 291 participants in the control group. Systolic blood pressure was lower by 6·9 mm Hg (95% CI 4·9–8·9; p < 0·0001) and blood pressure control rates were higher in the intervention group (76%) versus control group (58%; relative risk [RR] 1·30, 95% CI 1·15–1·47; p < 0·0001). There was no difference in adverse event-related treatment withdrawals at 12 weeks (intervention 4·0% vs control 2·4%; p = 0·27). Among the 417 patients who continued, uptitration occurred more frequently among control participants than intervention participants (p < 0·0001). However, at 52 weeks mean unattended systolic blood pressure remained lower by 7·7 mm Hg (95% CI 5·2–10·3) and blood pressure control rates higher in the intervention group (81%) versus control group (62%; RR 1·32, 95% CI 1·16–1·50). In all randomly assigned participants up to 12 weeks, there were seven (3%) serious adverse events in the intervention group and three (1%) serious adverse events in the control group.

Interpretation

A strategy with early treatment of a fixed-dose quadruple quarter-dose combination achieved and maintained greater blood pressure lowering compared with the common strategy of starting monotherapy. This trial demonstrated the efficacy, tolerability, and simplicity of a quadpill-based strategy.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^116UJkcQ]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study explored how Dutch GPs manage newly diagnosed primary, uncomplicated hypertension, identifying three key themes: contextual factors when initiating treatment, AHM class preferences, and considerations on combination therapy.

Contextual factors when initiating treatment included lifestyle modifications, patient age, initial BP, and patient preferences. GPs prioritized lifestyle changes, particularly for younger patients, to avoid early medicalization, balancing short-term side effects with long-term benefits. Contrary to the guideline's stance that AHM classes are largely equivalent for treating primary hypertension, most GPs in our study did not consider them interchangeable. Their preferences were shaped by perceived efficacy, side effects, patient-specific characteristics, and earlier guideline recommendations.

Likewise, the proposed recommendation to initiate treatment with two AHM classes simultaneously — a pending guideline change at the time of the interviews — was met with limited enthusiasm. This raises questions about how easily such recommendations will be adopted in practice, although attitudes may shift over time. Interviewed GPs often preferred a stepped approach, starting with monotherapy to better identify side effects and promote shared decision-making. They also voiced concerns that a sudden BP drop initiating dual therapy could undermine patient adherence. These findings are consistent with a 2007 phone survey among GPs, that found a similar preference for monotherapy as initial treatment. Rather than dismissing these concerns, acknowledging them in the guideline — with room for initial monotherapy followed by timely escalation — may support a more effective uptake of recommendations while still promoting evidence-based care.

Interviewed GPs generally preferred ACE inhibitors for younger patients. Although this was not explicitly confirmed in the data, their choices may reflect the influence of earlier guidelines — particularly the AB/CD rule, which recommended ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers for younger, non-black patients, and calcium channel blockers or diuretics for older or black patients. ARBs were mainly prescribed for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, likely due to their more recent introduction and less established role in practice. We expected to find other prescribing patterns, such as increased use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers among GPs trained under earlier guidelines, but no consistent trends were observed. Consistent with guidelines, CCBs were preferred for patients of African ancestry. They were also commonly used in patients with higher initial BP, which is not supported by current guidelines. Meanwhile, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers have declined in popularity as first-line options.

### Fixed-dose combination and chronic kidney disease progression: which is the best? [^111nFr95]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Use of combination therapy whether fixed dose or separate pill combinations is becoming more prevalent. Physicians are not routinely trained in using combinations of different antihypertensive medicines.

Recent Findings

Recent outcome trials as well as smaller studies document that meaningful combinations of pharmacologically additive agents help achieve blood pressure (BP) goals faster and reduce outcomes. Clinical trials demonstrate that drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, combined with either calcium antagonists or thiazide-like diuretics and used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal achieve BP goal faster than sequential monotherapy. Additionally, certain combinations may provide better cardiovascular outcomes than other combinations. Lastly, combination therapy has a clear role in helping to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk, when used.

Summary

This review provides an update of current evidence regarding the associations of BP control with use of combination antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP goals. A rationale for initial single pill and fixed-dose combination therapy is reviewed. Only one trial with cardiovascular outcome has been performed using a fixed-dose combination and this revealed differences from other trials, including the greatest number of people achieving goal BP and difference in outcomes based on combination used.

Combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) — use and candidate criteria: Combination therapy is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering blood pressure (BP) and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy, although a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed. Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably an SPC; available randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy.

In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk. For candidates for initial combination therapy — nonfrail adults with SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg from target — starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence; BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop. In most cases, SPCs are a cost-effective alternative to multiple pill combination therapy and allow longer follow-up intervals between medication intensifications, but because SPCs are not available with every possible combination, in some cases the use of separate agents may be more or equally effective.

### Low-dose combination therapy: the rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensives are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. Those combination agents should provide 24-h control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Also, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^113iMB9b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Based on recent national surveys, blood pressure (BP) control rates for patients with hypertension continue to be low and improvements in therapeutic management strategies are required in order for more patients to reach target BP goals. It is well recognized that most patients with hypertension will require two or more antihypertensive agents for effective BP control. Rational combinations of antihypertensive agents as single-pill formulations are readily available, but their use remains low primarily due to health care providers who are reluctant to intensify therapy. Earlier and more frequent use of combination therapy in the management of hypertension would greatly improve BP control rates. The FDA recently approved single-pill combinations of an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and combinations of ARB with amlodipine for initial treatment of hypertension in patients whose BP would not be controlled on monotherapy alone. The initial therapy indication did not stipulate the BP level at which combination therapy should be initiated, but current treatment guidelines suggest that use of combination therapy should be guided by baseline BP and the cardiovascular (CV) risk status of the patient.

For patients unresponsive to valsartan or low-dose HCTZ monotherapy, addition of the other agent has resulted in further reductions of BP, without increase in adverse events (AEs). The excellent tolerability and complementary BP-lowering effects of this combination makes it an ideal agent for initial use in patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension. The primary arguments against initiating treatment with combination therapy for hypertension are based on clinical need and safety concerns. Initial combination therapy for patients whose BP could be controlled by monotherapy, may lead to excessive drops in BP and thus increase the risk for hypotension-related AEs. Common practice is to initiate treatment with low-dose monotherapy and up-titrate to higher dose every 4 weeks. There has been no prospective study that has evaluated initial combination therapy using valsartan and HCTZ as compared with monotherapy when evaluating BP control rates and time to BP control in patients with primary essential hypertension without additional CV risk factors. Based on the need for improved BP control strategies, we conducted a study to determine the efficacy of initial combination therapy with valsartan and HCTZ for patients with stage-1 or stage-2, uncomplicated hypertension as compared with initiating therapy with low (80 mg) or higher dose (160 mg) valsartan monotherapy.

### Strategies for combination therapy in hypertension [^111QLRRq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To achieve the target blood pressure (BP) mandated by current guidelines, a large majority of patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the rational selection of effective drug combinations, and upon ways to use them efficiently to achieve therapeutic objectives. The topic is widely relevant given that more than 46 million ambulatory care visits are conducted in the United States annually for hypertension management.

Recent Findings

Recommended drug combinations exhibit complimentary pharmacology and additive BP reduction, are well tolerated, and include components with demonstrated endpoint reduction in long-term clinical trials. Recently, the choice of diuretics has emerged as a controversial issue with some evidence favoring the long-acting agent, chlorthalidone, in preference to hydrochlorothiazide. For resistant hypertension, mineralocorticoid antagonists are increasingly used as preferred add-on agents. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to the use of low-dose combinations, and to initiation of combination therapy in a broader range of hypertensive patients.

Summary

Thoughtful use of drug combinations is critical for achieving therapeutic objectives in hypertensive individuals and populations - more rapid BP control and more effective endpoint reduction. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to more recent recommendations favoring the use of low-dose combinations, and initiation therapy of combination treatment, particularly in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.

### Hypertension trials update [^117EdaWu]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implication

BP values ≤ 140/90 mmHg may be associated with an increased risk of mortality in octogenarians or elderly patients with previous cardiovascular events. The risk-benefit assessment of an intensified BP treatment should be critically and individually evaluated, especially in older patients.

Medical Therapy

Most patients with hypertension require lifelong medical therapy to achieve optimal BP control. The 2018 European Guidelines equally recommend five classes of antihypertensive drugs; these include ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers (BB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and diuretics (thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics).

Given the high rates of non-adherence to antihypertensive medication, the treatment regime should be effective and above all uncomplicated. Hence, the importance of combination treatment is particularly highlighted to improve adherence to therapy and BP control. Therefore, the 2018 European Guidelines recommend, especially in the context of lower BP targets, to start antihypertensive therapy with an initial dual fixed-dose combination of ACE-I or ARB + CCB or diuretic (see Fig. 9). These combinations should be the primary therapy for most patients. Exceptions are patients with grade 1 hypertension (especially with SBP values < 150 mmHg), low risk as well as elderly (≥ 80 years of age) or frail patients. If BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, it is recommended escalating to a three-drug combination of ACE-I or ARB + CCB + diuretic (i.e. a triple combination) (see Fig. 9). If BP still remains uncontrolled, despite triple therapy in sufficient doses, treatment should be increased by addition of spironolactone 25–50 mg or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a BB, or an alpha-blocker should be added (see Fig. 9). Therapy with BB is recommended especially for patients with cardiac comorbidities (heart failure, angina pectoris, post-myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or younger women).

By the end of phase 3, ≥ 75% of participants in both groups were at target (Table S4), with no difference between groups at the end of either phase 2 or 3. In contrast, only 40% of responses to initial monotherapy were controlled at target at the end of phase 1 (Figure 3 B), increasing to 50% of all responses to monotherapy (ie, on either losartan or HCTZ; Tables S5 and S6). Post hoc analysis identified only 35 participants whose initial monotherapy was their best treatment (Table S7).

In the monotherapy arm crossover, losartan and HCTZ were the more effective drugs in younger and older participants, respectively, but the age effect was modest, and losartan 100 mg was more effective than HCTZ 25 mg in most participants aged > 55 years (Table 3). Participants in the top renin tertile responded by 3.7 mm Hg more to losartan and by 4.3 mm Hg less to HCTZ than those in the lowest tertile, an overall difference between treatments of 8 mm Hg (Table 3, P < 0.001). In contrast, the response to combination therapy was independent of renin tertile and, on average, 5 mm Hg greater than the response to the best drug for each tertile (Figure 3 C). There was a greater response to all drugs, especially losartan, in women. Previous treatment favored response to combination, whereas monotherapy was more effective in participants who were naïve to treatment.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1124e2kh]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Novel approaches to management of hypertension [^114sPemB]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Of the roughly 1.4 billion people with hypertension worldwide, only about one in seven has their blood pressure (BP) successfully treated and adequately controlled. This review will focus on new therapeutic approaches of hypertension.

Recent Findings

Several recent clinical studies and guidelines have favoured the assessment of target organ damage and cardiovascular risk scores for the diagnosis and treatment approach of hypertension. Paradigm shifts recommended in the guidelines are the initiation of antihypertensive treatment with combination (not mono) therapy and the recommendation of single-pill combinations (SPC), which improve adherence and result in rapid and effective BP control. In clinical trials with optimized design and renal denervation (RDN) technology, the biological proof of concept has been established. Consistent, durable ambulatory and office BP reductions without procedure associated serious adverse events have been documented. The challenges are now to identify patients who respond best to interventional treatment.

Summary

Major key points in the treatment strategy for hypertension are: individualization of the therapy according to total cardiovascular risk, combination therapy as initial step, recommendation of SPC and RDN as promising interventional therapy.

### Triple-combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension: a review of the evidence [^111etyVR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a serious public health concern with inadequate control of blood pressure (BP) worldwide. Contributing factors include low efficacy of drugs, underuse of combination therapies, irrational combinations, physicians' therapeutic inertia and poor adherence to treatment. Current guidelines recommend the use of initial (dual) combination therapy in high-risk patients for immediate BP response, better short- and long-term BP control, and continued/improved patient adherence. This article aims to review the existing evidence of triple-combination therapies with respect to efficacy, safety and adherence to treatment. It is estimated that three drugs are required to achieve BP control in approximately one-fourth to one-third of patients. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that triple combinations of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide produce greater BP reductions, with greater proportions of patients achieving BP control compared with dual therapies. Further evidence also demonstrates that triple-combination therapy is efficacious for moderate to severe hypertension, with substantial additional BP reduction over dual regimens. Both RCTs and post-marketing observational studies have shown consistent and comparable efficacy in both the general population and high-risk hypertensive subgroups. Triple therapies are generally well tolerated with adverse event profiles similar to dual regimens. In addition, fixed-dose combinations used as single pill improve patient adherence leading to better long-term BP control. Depending on regional circumstances, they may also be cost effective. Thus, single-pill triple combinations of different classes of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action help to treat patients to goal with improved efficacy and better adherence to treatment.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1165rPnZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA and ESH guidelines recommend initial treatment with antihypertensive agents from at least 1 of 4 major classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The ESH guideline continues to recommend beta-blockers as an optional first-line therapy for several CV and many non-CV conditions, including atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while the American guideline only recommends them for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The ESH guideline points to several randomized control trials and meta-analyses that show beta-blockers significantly reduce major CVD events when compared to placebo.

Initiation of combination therapy with medications from different classes is also prominent in both guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends an initial two-drug regimen for patients with "stage 2 hypertension" and BP > 20/10 mm Hg above target, and for Black patients (COR I, LOE: C-EO), while ESH recommends initial therapy with a two-drug combination regimen for most patients with hypertension (COR I, LOE: A). ESH strongly advocates for single-pill combination therapy to improve medication adherence and achieve BP control, while the U.S. guideline recommends either single-pill combination or multi-pill combinations.

### Monotherapy vs combination treatments of different complexity: a meta-analysis of blood pressure lowering randomized outcome trials [^113Gme7V]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of drug combinations is recommended by hypertension guidelines for most patients because of the greater blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect compared with monotherapy. However, no evidence is available on outcome benefits of treatment strategies based on drug combinations vs. simpler treatment regimens, using data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We evaluated drug combination therapies of different complexity.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for BP-lowering RCTs that compared combination treatment or monotherapy vs. placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment. Combination treatment was considered as follows: background treatment continued during follow-up on top of the trial drug(s) of interest and drug(s) were added to the initial drug(s) of interest in the majority of the patients. Monotherapy was considered whenever pre-randomization treatment was withdrawn or absent and a single drug was administered at randomization. Complexity of treatment indicates the higher averaged number of daily medications used in the eligible RCTs.

Results

We selected 93 trials (290304 patients; follow-up, 3.9 years). The on-treatment mean number of drugs was 2.10 and 0.99 in the more and less actively treated patients, respectively. Compared with placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment, combination treatments of any complexity (mean number of drugs, 1.40 vs. 0.41, 2.32 vs. 0.48, 2.56 vs. 1.62 and 3.14 vs. 2.19) were associated with reduction of all or most fatal and nonfatal outcomes. There was also an increased rate of side effects leading to treatment discontinuation, although in absolute numbers the benefit usually prevailed.

Conclusion

These data provide randomized-based trial evidence that antihypertensive combination treatment up to three or more drugs is protective. The net benefit, however, may be attenuated when side effects are considered.

### Initial single-pill blood pressure-lowering therapy: should It Be for most people? [^1138ZCGG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The concept of initiating 2 different BP‐lowering medications that have complementary mechanisms of action is not novel. Use of combination BP‐lowering therapies started in the 1950s, when the single‐pill, triple combination of hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine was introduced. 1 This was then followed by several other formulations in the 1960s and 1970s, containing thiazide diuretics, including combinations with potassium‐sparing diuretics, β‐blockers, and clonidine. 1

In this issue of JAHA, the efficacy of initial combination antihypertensive therapy versus either of its individual components to achieve a BP goal was assessed by MacDonald and colleagues. 16 They evaluated 605 untreated hypertensive patients in a double‐blind, randomized, controlled trial to see if combination therapy with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide would result in better BP control compared with the individual monotherapies. The authors evaluated differences from baseline in home systolic BP, averaged over different durations of the study. The authors noted that monotherapy had a 4.9‐mm Hg higher systolic BP compared with the combination group at 16 weeks, but by 32 weeks this effect dissipated once all patients crossed over to combination therapy. Differences in BP lowering were noted on the basis of plasma renin activity. Predictably, those with low renin levels had a greater BP‐lowering response to hydrochlorothiazide, whereas the converse was true for losartan. The response to BP lowering by renin levels was prospectively tested in a trial in which renin levels were used to predict therapy response versus routine care; the primary end point was BP goal achievement. 17 The study showed results similar to what was observed by the investigators. The authors also note no differences in withdrawals attributable to adverse events among the groups. They conclude that many combination tablets cost no more than the single components but assert they offer no advantage for BP control in the long‐term. Although this is true based on this and other observations, having BP better controlled for 4 months over the monotherapy groups does provide at least a theoretical advantage.

### Bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medications: systematic review and consensus statement: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^116NwUQf]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive drug therapy is one of the most efficient medical interventions for preventing disability and death globally. Most of the evidence supporting its benefits has been derived from outcome trials with morning dosing of medications. Accumulating evidence suggests an adverse prognosis associated with night-time hypertension, nondipping blood pressure (BP) profile and morning BP surge, with increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first few morning hours. These observations provide justification for complete 24-h BP control as being the primary goal of antihypertensive treatment. Bedtime administration of antihypertensive drugs has also been proposed as a potentially more effective treatment strategy than morning administration. This Position Paper by the International Society of Hypertension reviewed the published evidence on the clinical relevance of the diurnal variation in BP and the timing of antihypertensive drug treatment, aiming to provide consensus recommendations for clinical practice. Eight published outcome hypertension studies involved bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs, and all had major methodological and/or other flaws and a high risk of bias in testing the impact of bedtime compared to morning treatment. Three ongoing, well designed, prospective, randomized controlled outcome trials are expected to provide high-quality data on the efficacy and safety of evening or bedtime versus morning drug dosing. Until that information is available, preferred use of bedtime drug dosing of antihypertensive drugs should not be routinely recommended in clinical practice. Complete 24-h control of BP should be targeted using readily available, long-acting antihypertensive medications as monotherapy or combinations administered in a single morning dose.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of diuretics as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^112qevVG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are widely prescribed for hypertension not only as a first-line drug but also as a second-line drug. Therefore, it is essential to determine the effects of diuretics on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) when given as a second-line drug.

Objectives

To quantify the additional reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of diuretic therapy as a second-line drug in patients with primary hypertension

Search Strategy

CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-July 2008), EMBASE (1988-July 2008) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of a diuretic in combination therapy with another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with the respective monotherapy (without a diuretic) for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Fifty-three double-blind RCTs evaluating a thiazide in 15129 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 156/101 mmHg) were included. Hydrochlorothiazide was the thiazide used in 49/53 (92%) of the included studies. The additional BP reduction caused by the thiazide as a second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. Thiazides as a second-line drug reduced BP by 6/3 and 8/4 mmHg at doses of 1 and 2 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose respectively. The BP lowering effect was dose related. The effect was similar to that obtained when thiazides are used as a single agent. Only 3 double-blind RCTs evaluating loop diuretics were identified. These RCTs showed a BP lowering effect of a starting dose of about 6/3 mmHg.

Authors' Conclusions

Thiazides when given as a second-line drug have a dose related effect to lower blood pressure that is similar to when they are added as a first-line drug. This means that the BP lowering effect of thiazides is additive. Loop diuretics appear to have a similar blood pressure lowering effect as thiazides at 1 times the recommended starting dose. Because of the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting of adverse events, this review does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of adverse effects of diuretics given as a second-line drug.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^11688g7A]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Medication Reinstatement Algorithms

Except for patient-related safety requiring deviation from study protocol, baseline medications should remain without change (or absent in OFF-MED trials) for both treatment and control groups until timing of the primary BP outcome measure. There are 2 main reasons for starting, resuming, or enhancing medical therapy after the study's primary outcome is reached: (1) an ethical need to control BP in the trial's study participants, and (2) to compare medication requirements between the device-treated and the control groups to learn whether the procedure affects the intensity of medical treatment required to achieve the BP target.

A typical medication algorithm, already used in device-based hypertension trials for patients initially OFF-MED, is described in. The selection of medication classes, and their order of use in this stepwise titration, conforms with widely used current international hypertension guidelines, with further recommendations provided in thefootnote how to individualize therapy in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension. One shortcoming in trials completed to date, is that using the algorithm has been left to the discretion of the clinical investigators and not mandatory. It is recommended that future trials include rigorous protocols for the intensification of medical therapy by the clinical staff or treating physicians, as tolerated, to achieve target BP, while verifying adherence to medications by patients.

Figure 1.
Eighth Joint National Committee evidence‐based algorithm for the treatment of hypertension. Reproduced with permission from: James et al. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

Blood pressure primary prevention — screening and treatment recommendations: In adults ≥ 18 years of age, screening for hypertension is recommended to identify individuals at increased risk for stroke and eligible for antihypertensive treatment (COR 1; LOE C-LD). In adults with stage 2 hypertension or stage 1 hypertension with a higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), lifestyle improvement and antihypertensive drug treatment to a systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) < 130/80 mm Hg are recommended to prevent stroke (COR 1; LOE A). In adults with hypertension, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended as initial antihypertensive drug therapies to prevent stroke (COR 1; LOE A). In most adults with hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment incorporating ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications is indicated to achieve the BP control necessary to prevent stroke (COR 1; LOE A).

Core drug treatment strategy for uncomplicated hypertension — initial therapy uses dual combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB or diuretic"; if further control is needed, step up to the triple combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB + diuretic", and for resistant hypertension add spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) or other diuretic, alpha-blocker or beta-blocker, with consideration of referral to a specialist centre for further investigation. Consider monotherapy in low risk grade 1 hypertension (systolic BP < 150mmHg), or in very old (≥ 80 years) or frailer patients. Consider beta-blockers at any treatment step, when there is a specific indication for their use, e.g. heart failure, angina, post-MI, atrial fibrillation, or younger women with, or planning, pregnancy; ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), CCB (calcium channel blocker), and o.d.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^116mnMfS]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

One of the clinical challenges with treating a multifactorial disease like hypertension is that it is very difficult to predict an individual's response to any given treatment. An individual's response to therapy is not only influenced by baseline factors, such as activity of the renin–angiotensin system and sodium intake, but is also affected by the patient's compensatory response to the therapy in an attempt to prevent further lowering BP. Using two well-tolerated antihypertensive agents with complementary modes of action to reduce BP will act to limit the counter-regulatory response and thus ensure effective antihypertensive response in a majority of patients. Initiating antihypertensive therapy for patients with stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension, using a well-tolerated combination agent such as an ACE-inhibitor or ARB and low-dose diuretic, is perhaps a more effective approach to enable more patients in the primary care setting to reach the BP goal. A recent study adopted this treatment approach in primary care offices where patients were initiated with combination therapy using a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) and low-dose diuretic as compared with the conventional guideline treatment approach of starting with monotherapy. The study demonstrated excellent tolerability and superior BP control rates using initial combination therapy as compared with those patients who were started with monotherapy and titrated upwards following established treatment guidelines. Thus there is good evidence to recommend wide use of combination agents as first-line therapy for hypertensive patients, regardless of their baseline BP, in the clinical practice setting.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^114Czxrz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Strengthening the hypertension care cascade by achieving high rates of screening, treatment, and control could save tens of millions of lives worldwide. But antihypertensive treatment is well short of what is needed to meet global targets to reduce the prevalence of raised blood pressure by 25 percent between 2010 and 2025.

Only 63 countries screen at least 50 percent of their population for hypertension, treat at least 50 percent of individuals who are identified with hypertension, and achieve control in at least 50 percent of the individuals who are treated. Most (60 percent) of those countries are classified as "high income" by the World Bank. The end result is that nearly four in ten individuals with hypertension achieve control in high income countries, while only around one in ten do in low- and lower-middle income countries (LMICs).

Low rates of hypertension control (generally defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm of mercury (mm Hg)) result from patient and provider barriers that exist along the care cascade, including individual-level barriers (e.g. skills, knowledge, beliefs, unfulfilled intentions) and health system-level barriers (i.e. the availability, affordability, and acceptability of care). Many patients who initiate treatment do not achieve control, suggesting that there is a need to address the quality and effectiveness of care among those who have already connected with the health system.

The 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) hypertension treatment guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and other evidence supporting hypertension treatment standard practices. One recommendation from the 2021 WHO guideline is to deploy combination therapy — the use of two or more medications — as the first-line initial treatment for hypertension. Within those protocols, it is preferable to use fixed dose single pill combination (SPC) therapy — two or more medications in a single pill as opposed to two or more medications in separate pills. The goal of the recommendations is twofold: 1) to increase the quality of treatment by cutting through therapeutic inertia — the "failure of a health provider to initiate or intensify therapy when therapeutic goals are not reached" — and 2) to increase treatment adherence by reducing the pill burden for patients.

### Combination antihypertensive drugs: recommendations… [^113RewBE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

21 assessed the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy using the cardioselective beta blocker bisoprolol alone and in combination with low dosages of hydrochlorothiazide. The dosages of bisoprolol were 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg per day. The hydrochlorothiazide dosages were 6. 25 and 25 mg per day. The study showed that monotherapy with either agent was more effective than placebo, but that when combination therapy was used, the beneficial effects were greater than when either agent was used alone.
21. In this study, 23 505 patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 to 114 mm Hg received placebo, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide or the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. All drug therapies were more effective than placebo in lowering blood pressure, but the combination antihypertensive therapies produced the greatest effect.
23.

The study 23 found that the combination consisting of 10 mg per day of lisinopril and
12. 5 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. The most commonly observed side effects were pharyngitis, increased cough, dizziness, headache and asthenia. Cough was the only side effect that was more prevalent in this group than in the placebo group. One study 27 evaluated the efficacies of losartan in a dosage of 50 mg per day, hydrochlorothiazide in a dosage of 12. 5 mg per day and combination therapy with 50 mg per day of losartan and
6. 25 or 12. 5 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide. Final Comment The JNC VI 1 continues to recommend monotherapy with a diuretic or beta blocker as initial treatment for the undifferentiated patient with hypertension.

At the same time, it is recognized that monotherapy will not provide adequate blood pressure control in a large proportion of patients, and that many patients will experience unacceptable side effects with higher dosages of a single agent. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive medications are a useful and appropriate treatment option in this large group of patients.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria.

4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.
