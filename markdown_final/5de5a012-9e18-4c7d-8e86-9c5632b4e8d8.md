## Question

Make a VHL teaching vignette with clinical pearls

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a teaching vignette on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease with clinical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and how to frame the initial evaluation. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and when to pursue genetic testing. Next, I will review organ-specific surveillance protocols and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to examine management principles, including renal thresholds and ocular treatment windows. Finally, I will consider emerging therapies, special populations, and patient-centered care, and close with a concise synthesis that ties the pearls together.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and red flags that should trigger suspicion for VHL. A 28-year-old with bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas, a cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and multiple pancreatic cysts fits the classic multi-organ pattern of VHL, which predisposes to highly vascular CNS and retinal tumors, clear cell RCC, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, endolymphatic sac tumors, and epididymal or broad ligament cystadenomas, among others [^115v73Kg]. Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology and inheritance to guide counseling: prevalence is about 1 in 36,000 with autosomal dominant transmission and high penetrance, so first-degree relatives carry a 50% risk and de novo mutations account for roughly 20% of probands, which underscores the need for cascade testing and early surveillance in at-risk relatives [^1125YKR2] [^116pRuvX] [^1119yW6Y] [^1173QBpm].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and when a clinical diagnosis is sufficient versus when genetic confirmation is required. I need to ensure I apply the correct thresholds: clinical diagnosis is established with two or more retinal or CNS hemangioblastomas, or one hemangioblastoma plus a characteristic visceral tumor such as clear cell RCC, pheochromocytoma, or endolymphatic sac tumor; alternatively, a single retinal hemangioblastoma in the setting of a positive family history suffices [^113UAW1j] [^1173QBpm]. Wait, let me verify the role of genetic testing: even with a clinical diagnosis, germline VHL testing is standard of care and detects pathogenic variants in 95–100% of clinically diagnosed cases, and importantly, a solitary retinal hemangioblastoma without a family history should prompt genetic evaluation because up to 46% of such cases harbor a germline VHL mutation [^115oxZwg] [^111qbxH1]. I should double-check that testing indications also include early-onset clear cell RCC, pheochromocytoma, or endolymphatic sac tumor even without other stigmata, as these are referral triggers for cancer predisposition assessment [^111qbxH1].

> I will now examine organ-specific surveillance, starting with the eyes, since retinal hemangioblastomas are among the earliest and most treatable manifestations. Let me confirm the schedule: ocular screening should begin within 12 months of life and continue lifelong, with exams every 6–12 months until age 30 and at least annually thereafter. Pregnancy warrants screening prior to conception and every 6–12 months during gestation, and ultra-widefield imaging can be adjunctive but does not replace dilated ophthalmoscopy by an experienced examiner [^117T8g8e] [^116j3q6Q] [^113RdCi3]. Hold on, I should verify treatment thresholds: extramacular and extrapapillary lesions should be treated promptly, ideally when ≤ 500 μm, because laser photocoagulation achieves near-universal success in small tumors and vision is preserved when treated before symptoms develop, whereas larger lesions respond poorly and carry higher morbidity [^111qfUa9] [^114PpyRL] [^1156NtLZ].

> Now, for CNS hemangioblastomas, I need to check the surveillance cadence and reconcile differing recommendations. The neurosurgical consensus suggests baseline brain and spine MRI around age 11, then every 2 years through age 65 or with symptom onset, with annual clinical evaluation as the primary screening tool; this balances early detection with resource use and radiation avoidance [^112TnQx4]. But wait, what if a center uses a different interval? Some programs use 12–36 month MRI intervals starting in adolescence, and real-world audits show that many centers adopted 36-month intervals, yet asymptomatic detection rates improved when surveillance MRI was implemented, supporting the value of scheduled imaging even if cadences vary across centers [^116q1P24] [^112tD5mt]. I should confirm that asymptomatic lesions, especially with cystic components or rapid growth, warrant closer follow-up and proactive surgical planning to prevent neurologic decline [^112tD5mt].

> For abdominal surveillance, let me think about renal and pancreatic risks and the optimal modality. Annual abdominal imaging from mid-adolescence is standard, with MRI preferred over ultrasound for small renal mass detection. Many centers begin at age 16, though some start earlier in high-risk families, and alternating MRI with ultrasound is reasonable where resources are constrained, but MRI detects smaller lesions and facilitates earlier, nephron-sparing management [^116q1P24] [^113duZMJ]. I should confirm the renal threshold: the widely used 3 cm rule supports observation until a solid renal mass approaches 3 cm, at which point partial nephrectomy or ablation is recommended to minimize metastatic risk while preserving renal function; however, I need to ensure we acknowledge heterogeneity in growth kinetics, as some lesions under 2 cm can progress quickly, arguing for individualized intervals and careful monitoring of growth rates before extending surveillance intervals [^1154YKnQ] [^112tD5mt].

> For pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, I should confirm that biochemical screening starts in childhood in VHL, typically around age 5–10, with annual blood pressure and plasma free metanephrines or urinary catecholamines, and earlier or more frequent surveillance in families with known PPGL risk or specific variants. Adrenal imaging is added when biochemistry is positive or if symptoms suggest catecholamine excess [^116q1P24]. Hold on, I should verify perioperative implications: any patient with known or suspected VHL who needs surgery should have preoperative catecholamine screening to avoid an occult pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be catastrophic if unrecognized [^115pBdB1].

> Next, I should review management principles across organ systems, emphasizing nephron-sparing strategies and early, minimally invasive ocular therapy. For renal cell carcinoma in VHL, partial nephrectomy or ablation at the 3 cm threshold preserves renal function and reduces dialysis risk; observation of smaller lesions is acceptable given low metastatic potential, but I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize, as rare aggressive courses can occur and mandate closer follow-up when growth is atypical [^1154YKnQ] [^112tD5mt]. For retinal hemangioblastomas, prompt laser for small extramacular lesions is favored, while juxtapapillary and macular lesions are more complex and may require observation or pars plana vitrectomy if vision-threatening; systemic HIF-2α inhibition is an emerging option that may mitigate ablation-related damage in sensitive locations, though protocols are still evolving [^111qfUa9] [^115o2Gmb] [^115pWGcx]. For CNS hemangioblastomas, surgery is generally reserved for symptomatic lesions or those with progressive cystic expansion, with timing individualized to balance neurologic risk and surgical morbidity [^112tD5mt].

> I need to check emerging therapies and how they might reshape surveillance and treatment. Belzutifan, an oral HIF-2α inhibitor, is FDA-approved for VHL-associated RCC, CNS hemangioblastomas, and pNETs not requiring immediate surgery, with meaningful response rates in RCC and CNS lesions and stabilization or regression in pNETs; this introduces a nonsurgical pathway that many patients prefer given the burden of repeated operations [^1174f3s6] [^111tkBSJ]. Let me reconsider ocular care: preliminary data suggest belzutifan may help control retinal hemangioblastomas, particularly in macular or juxtapapillary regions where laser carries vision risk, but I should confirm that current ocular guidelines still position systemic therapy as investigational adjunctive care pending longer-term data and standardized protocols [^115o2Gmb].

> Special populations require tailored protocols, so I should double-check pediatric and pregnancy-specific guidance. In children at risk, predictive genetic testing should be offered early so that mutation-negative relatives can be discharged from surveillance, while mutation-positive children undergo age-appropriate screening; ocular exams can begin in infancy with examination under anesthesia when needed, and CNS MRI typically starts around age 11, though some programs initiate earlier in high-risk families [^112sWspq] [^117T8g8e] [^112TnQx4]. During pregnancy, I need to ensure continuation of ocular surveillance every 6–12 months and judicious use of fluorescein angiography only when results will change management, given category C labeling and the potential for maternal anxiety around imaging and treatment decisions [^116j3q6Q].

> But wait, what about the growing cohort of individuals with incidental VHL findings on multigene panels who lack clinical stigmata at detection? I should confirm that penetrance remains high historically, yet some incidentally discovered variants may show reduced expressivity; until natural history is clearer, most experts recommend applying standard surveillance protocols while acknowledging uncertainty and the need for longitudinal data and centralized care to coordinate follow-up and research [^116pRuvX] [^1138CsVw] [^112ieUSL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: shared decision-making is essential here, balancing potential overtreatment against the historical morbidity of missed tumors, and this is precisely where centralized, registry-linked care can mitigate harm and advance knowledge [^112ieUSL].

> I should also review patient-reported outcomes and preferences, because repeated surgeries materially affect quality of life. Survey data show that most patients with VHL have undergone multiple surgeries and report substantial fatigue, mental health impacts, and functional limitations; nearly three-quarters would prefer a daily pill to delay or reduce surgery, even accepting mild to moderate side effects, which reinforces the clinical value of belzutifan and the imperative to develop additional non-surgical options [^117ArYvz] [^116DbsEM]. Let me verify that these findings align with earlier statements about patient goals: yes, reducing the number of surgeries, delaying surgery, and maintaining daily function are consistently ranked as top priorities, and clinicians should explicitly incorporate these preferences into care plans [^117ArYvz].

> Finally, I need to ensure the care model matches the disease complexity. Multidisciplinary, centralized care with a named coordinator improves continuity, reduces fragmented visits, and facilitates access to subspecialists experienced in VHL. Real-world audits demonstrate feasibility and benefits of such models, and expert guidelines endorse management at centers with VHL expertise whenever possible [^112mA8W2] [^1121x2g1] [^112nfNjr]. Hold on, I should verify that this extends beyond logistics: centralization also concentrates knowledge, supports research, and enables rapid integration of new therapies, which is particularly impactful in rare diseases like VHL where evidence evolves continuously [^112ieUSL].

> In summary, I should confirm the key pearls that change outcomes: suspect VHL in young patients with multi-organ vascular tumors or early-onset clear cell RCC. Apply clinical criteria and pursue germline testing with cascade screening. Implement lifelong, organ-specific surveillance beginning in infancy for the eyes and adolescence for CNS and abdomen. Treat retinal hemangioblastomas early and small. Observe renal lesions until 3 cm then pursue nephron-sparing surgery. Screen for pheochromocytoma from childhood and always before elective surgery. Consider belzutifan to reduce surgical burden where appropriate. And deliver care through a coordinated multidisciplinary center that respects patient preferences and participates in registries to advance care standards [^1125YKR2] [^112i8umB] [^117T8g8e] [^112TnQx4] [^1154YKnQ] [^1174f3s6] [^112ieUSL].

A 28-year-old woman presents with **bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas** and a cerebellar hemangioblastoma; her father had renal cell carcinoma at 45 and a pheochromocytoma. Genetic testing confirms a **pathogenic VHL mutation**, establishing the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Management centers on **multidisciplinary care** with lifelong surveillance for retinal, CNS, renal, adrenal, pancreatic, and endolymphatic sac lesions, and early genetic counseling for at-risk relatives. Key pearls: **early detection preserves vision** [^115Q1xd2]; small retinal lesions are treated with laser [^114PpyRL]; renal tumors are observed until ~3 cm, then managed with nephron-sparing surgery or ablation [^112rseMJ]; and belzutifan is a new systemic option for select tumors [^111tkBSJ].

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by **VHL tumor suppressor mutations** [^1125YKR2], with a prevalence of ~1:36,000 and high penetrance [^1125YKR2]. Diagnosis is clinical or genetic: **two or more hemangioblastomas** (retinal or CNS) or one hemangioblastoma plus a characteristic visceral tumor (RCC, pheochromocytoma, or endolymphatic sac tumor) [^1173QBpm]. In this vignette, bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas and a cerebellar hemangioblastoma meet clinical criteria; genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and enables cascade testing [^1119yW6Y].

---

## Molecular pathogenesis

VHL encodes the VHL protein, which targets hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation; **VHL mutations cause HIF accumulation**, promoting angiogenesis and tumorigenesis [^113JWuhs]. This HIF dysregulation underlies the vascular, cystic, and solid tumors seen in VHL [^113JWuhs].

## Clinical manifestations and surveillance

| **Organ system** | **Manifestations** | **Surveillance recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Retina | Hemangioblastomas | - Examine every 6–12 months until age 30, then annually [^117T8g8e] <br/> - Treat small lesions promptly [^111qfUa9] |
| CNS | Hemangioblastomas | Baseline MRI at age 11, then every 1–2 years [^notfound] |
| Kidney | - RCC <br/> - Cysts | Annual MRI or ultrasound from age 16 [^116q1P24] |
| Adrenal | Pheochromocytoma | Annual plasma/urine metanephrines from age 5–8 [^notfound] |
| Pancreas | - Cysts <br/> - Neuroendocrine tumors | Annual MRI or ultrasound from age 16 [^116q1P24] |
| Ear | Endolymphatic sac tumors | Baseline audiometry and MRI [^notfound] |

## Management strategies

- **Retinal hemangioblastomas**: Early laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy for small lesions preserves vision [^114PpyRL]; juxtapapillary lesions are more challenging and may require observation or vitrectomy [^115pWGcx].

- **CNS hemangioblastomas**: Surgery for symptomatic or enlarging lesions; asymptomatic lesions are observed with regular MRI [^112TnQx4].

- **Renal cell carcinoma**: Nephron-sparing surgery or ablation when tumors approach 3 cm; belzutifan is a new HIF-2α inhibitor for select cases [^1154YKnQ] [^1174f3s6].

- **Pheochromocytoma**: Adrenalectomy after appropriate alpha-blockade; genetic testing guides surveillance and family counseling [^113n3BLg].

---

## Genetic counseling and family screening

Genetic counseling is essential for at-risk relatives, with **early testing enabling targeted surveillance** and sparing those who test negative [^115B81rc]. Cascade testing identifies affected family members before symptoms, improving outcomes [^1119yW6Y].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Historically, median survival was ~49 years; modern surveillance and nephron-sparing surgery have improved survival and reduced morbidity [^115PgEeE]. Repeated surgeries impact fatigue, mental health, and daily function; patients often prefer systemic therapies that delay or reduce surgery [^117ArYvz].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Belzutifan, a HIF-2α inhibitor, shows promise for RCC, hemangioblastomas, and pNETs, offering a nonsurgical option that may reduce surgical burden [^111tkBSJ]. Ongoing research aims to refine surveillance, optimize surgical timing, and explore novel targeted therapies [^1149RxWB].

---

## Clinical pearls

- **Early detection preserves vision**: Regular retinal exams and prompt treatment of small lesions are critical [^116sQMvn].

- **Multidisciplinary care is essential**: Coordinated care across ophthalmology, neurosurgery, urology, endocrinology, and genetics improves outcomes [^114qYiL1].

- **Patient education empowers self-advocacy**: Informed patients engage in surveillance and timely intervention [^notfound].

- **Genetic testing guides management**: Testing informs diagnosis, surveillance, and family planning [^115oxZwg].

VHL is a multisystem disorder requiring lifelong surveillance and coordinated care. Early detection, genetic counseling, and emerging therapies like belzutifan are key to improving outcomes and quality of life [^1125YKR2].

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^115Q1xd2]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) ocular surveillance — individuals with known or suspected VHL disease should undergo periodic ocular screening with dilated ophthalmoscopy; grading: Evidence (type): III, Evidence (strength): C, Recommendation (strength): 2A. Reported disease burden supports screening: retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs) were present in 335 (38%) of 890 patients from 220 unrelated pedigrees, and cumulative risk reached nearly 80% in patients over the age of 80 years. Early-screened cohorts showed that 97 (85%) of 116 RHs were asymptomatic in a cohort of 37 patients in Denmark for whom ocular screening was initiated before age 18. Visual morbidity is documented, with some degree of at least unilateral vision impairment present in approximately 20% of 335 patients with ocular VHL disease, with 6% having visual acuity of < 20/200 in both eyes. In a national cohort, approximately 60% of cases were diagnosed in adulthood, and during active surveillance 93 (95%) of 98 disease manifestations were found at an asymptomatic stage. In another cohort, 36 (63%) presented with symptoms and 21 (37%) presented without symptoms; average visual acuity at presentation was 20/87 in symptomatic eyes and 20/22 in asymptomatic eyes, and under periodic eye examination almost all new RHs were detected when small (diameter ≤ 0.5 disc diameters) with eyes asymptomatic at presentation maintaining similar good visual acuity (average, 20/24) at the end of follow up.

### Renal cancer in Von Hippel-Lindau disease and related syndromes [^114tTpo1]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Sporadic and hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and the familial paraganglioma syndromes are closely related in terms of their clinical, molecular, and genetic aspects. Most RCCs occur sporadically and the heritable fraction of RCC is estimated to be just 2–4%. An understanding of the molecular genetic basis, the disease-specific and gene-specific biology and the clinical characteristics of these cancer syndromes is of utmost importance for effective genetic diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In addition, such insight will improve our understanding of sporadic RCCs. To date, 10 different heritable RCC syndromes have been described. VHL syndrome is the oldest known hereditary RCC syndrome. Similar to VHL disease, phaeochromocytoma is a major manifestation of the paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3 and 4 in which RCCs have been reported. These syndromes are therefore regarded as VHL-related disorders and are included in this Review. Multifocal tumours, bilateral occurrence, a young age at diagnosis and/or family history are clinical red flags suggestive of hereditary disease and should trigger referral for genetic and molecular analysis. The identification of an underlying genetic alteration enables gene-specific risk assessment and opens up the possibility of a tailored follow-up strategy and specific surveillance protocols as the basis of effective preventive medicine. The important goals of preventive medicine are to increase the life expectancy of affected patients and to improve their quality of life. The study of seemingly rare hereditary syndromes and their susceptibility genes has consistently revealed clues regarding the aetiology and pathogenesis of these diseases, and can aid diagnosis and the development of therapeutics for patients affected by much more common sporadic counterparts.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^1156NtLZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease ocular management — laser photocoagulation outcomes for small retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs): No prospective study evaluating the efficacy of intervention has been conducted, but retrospective data indicate near-universal success for small lesions. In a cohort of 57 consecutive cases followed for an average of 7.3 years, 254 new RHs were detected; almost all were small and effectively treated with laser photocoagulation, and eyes treated prior to symptoms maintained good vision. Retrospective series using laser photocoagulation for small RHs with diameter ≤ 1.5 mm report near-universal success; for example, Singh et al. managed 174 RH in 86 eyes (68 patients) with favorable outcomes in 18 of 18 (100%) tumors with diameter of ≤ 1.5 mm compared with 8 of 17 (47%) larger RH, and Krockwitz et al. reported successful destruction in 271 of 271 (100%) RH with diameter ≤ 1.5 mm over an average of 1.3 laser sessions compared with 24 (73%) of 33 larger RH over a mean of 3.5 sessions.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^113UAW1j]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

VHL clinical diagnosis criteria based on RHs and family history: The clinical diagnosis of VHL disease is made using criteria based on family history and cardinal manifestations such as RH, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma and neuro-endocrine tumors, and clear cell renal carcinoma; relevant to ophthalmic evaluation, diagnosis of one or more RHs in the setting of a family history of VHL disease, or two or more RH even in the absence of a family history of VHL disease is sufficient for the clinical diagnosis of the condition, although ophthalmologists often face diagnostic uncertainty in cases where a solitary RH is present without a family history, where a RH exists alongside additional lesions that are missed or difficult to differentiate, or where an at-risk individual with a family history does not manifest RHs and has not had full evaluation for extraocular manifestations or genetic testing.

Evidence grading is specified as Evidence (type): III, Evidence (strength): C, Recommendation (strength): 2A, and given the minimal risks of treatment for small extrapapillary / extramacular RHs, prompt treatment is preferred following detection.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease: gene to bedside [^114iVatn]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau is an autosomal dominant familial tumor syndrome with a risk of developing central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, kidney cysts and clear cell carcinoma, cyst adenomas of other organs and pheochromocytoma. Despite continued elaboration of the neurobiologic role of the von Hippel-Lindau protein, the mainstay of management remains the definitive clinical diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (as distinct from sporadic cases of single von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors), clinical monitoring and preemptive intervention by surgical or ablative therapy. Specific pharmacologic treatment awaits further biologic understanding of critical pathogenic components. Increasingly sensitive imaging and surgical techniques allow for optimum clinical management and intervention. This article will review von Hippel-Lindau molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlations and clinical classification, current understanding of the biology of the von Hippel-Lindau protein, its role in the pathophysiology of this disorder and the consequent implications for future therapeutic/interventional strategies. Central nervous system manifestations will be highlighted.

### Update on surveillance in Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^1149RxWB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a genetic condition characterized by a high lifetime risk for tumors and cysts throughout the body, including the central nervous system, visual-auditory systems, and intra-abdominal organs. This neoplasia leads to significant morbidity and potential mortality in affected individuals. Tumor surveillance enables early intervention and leads to improved clinical outcomes. Since the 2017 publication of VHL tumor surveillance recommendations from the inaugural American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop, several other groups have proposed alternative consensus surveillance recommendations. Although these screening paradigms share some common elements, they also deviate from each other in some substantial ways. Clinical data continue to accrue in VHL, allowing the condition to be better characterized. Furthermore, surgical techniques have improved over time, and the option of targeted medical therapy has emerged for individuals with VHL. It is critical that surveillance strategies continue to be refined. In this perspective, we provide an up-to-date clinical overview of VHL, describe recently proposed tumor screening regimens, and finally present our updated consensus tumor surveillance recommendations during childhood and adolescence from the 2023 American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop.

Hereditary cancer risk and upper tract imaging in microhematuria: In patients with microhematuria who have a family history of renal cell carcinoma, a known genetic renal tumor syndrome, or a personal or family history of (or suspicious for) Lynch syndrome, clinicians should perform upper tract imaging regardless of risk category (Expert Opinion), and the imaging modality is at provider discretion although CT or MR urography or RPG would be preferred in Lynch syndrome. Known genetic renal tumor syndromes listed include von Hippel-Lindau, Birt-Hogg-Dube, Hereditary papillary RCC, Hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC, and Tuberous sclerosis.

### Genetic kidney cancer syndromes [^1175Z3zD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have yielded clues regarding the molecular pathogenesis of sporadic RCC. The discovery of germline mutations in chromatin-modulating enzymes also defined a new hereditary RCC syndrome. Although histologically distinct RCC subtypes exist, emerging themes shared between hereditary and sporadic RCC include dysregulation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein/hypoxia inducible factor axis, defective ciliogenesis, and aberrant tumor metabolism. This article describes the most common hereditary RCC syndromes and associated extrarenal manifestations. Recent evidence supports developing screening guidelines for early-onset RCC to identify persons with germline mutations in the absence of secondary clinical manifestations.

Purpose

To develop guidelines for ocular surveillance and early intervention for individuals with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.

Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Participants

Expert panel of retina specialists and ocular oncologists.

Methods

A consortium of experts on clinical management of all-organ aspects of VHL disease was convened. Working groups with expertise in organ-specific features of VHL disease were tasked with development of evidence-based guidelines for each organ system. The ophthalmology subcommittee formulated questions for consideration and performed a systematic literature review. Evidence was graded for topic quality and relevance and the strength of each recommendation, and guideline recommendations were developed.

Results

The quality of evidence was limited, and no controlled clinical trial data were available. Consensus guidelines included: (1) individuals with known or suspected VHL disease should undergo periodic ocular screening (evidence type, III; evidence strength, C; degree of consensus, 2A); (2) patients at risk of VHL disease, including first-degree relatives of patients with known VHL disease, or any patient with single or multifocal retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs), should undergo genetic testing for pathologic VHL disease gene variants as part of an appropriate medical evaluation (III/C/2A); (3) ocular screening should begin within 12 months after birth and continue throughout life (III/C/2A); (4) ocular screening should occur approximately every 6 to 12 months until 30 years of age and then at least yearly thereafter (III/C-D/2A); (5) ocular screening should be performed before a planned pregnancy and every 6 to 12 months during pregnancy (IV/D/2A); (6) ultra-widefield color fundus photography may be helpful in certain circumstances to monitor RHs, and ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography may be helpful in certain circumstances to detect small RHs (IV/D/2A); (7) patients should be managed, whenever possible, by those with subspecialty training, with experience with VHL disease or RHs, or with both and ideally within the context of a multidisciplinary center capable of providing multiorgan surveillance and access to genetic testing (IV/D/2A); (8) extramacular or extrapapillary RHs should be treated promptly (III/C/2A).

Conclusions

Based on available evidence from observational studies, broad agreement was reached for a strategy of lifelong surveillance and early treatment for ocular VHL disease. These guidelines were endorsed by the VHL Alliance and the International Society of Ocular Oncology and were approved by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Board of Trustees.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^116q1P24]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Surveillance programmes in clinical genetics centres offering VHL disease surveillance

Retinal haemangioblastoma

Using the standard recommendation of "annual ophthalmic examinations (direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy), beginning in infancy or early childhood", the majority (15/18) centres met the audit standard with most centres (13/18) commenced retinal surveillance at age 5 years (two centres started earlier (age 2 or 3 years)) but three centres started later (e.g. 5–8 years, 5–10 years or 7–10 years).

Central nervous system haemangioblastoma

The surveillance recommendation that responses were assessed against was "MRI scans of the head for every 12–36 months, beginning in adolescence". All centres offered some surveillance for cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas, though there were inter-centre variations according to whether regular surveillance was performed (for brain in 16 centres for spinal cord in 13 centres) or just a baseline MRI (for brain and spinal cord in 5 centres at median age 16 years (range 11–18 years). The first CNS MRI scan was generally performed 14 to 16 years (58% of centres, range 8–18 years). For those centres that performed regular MRI scans the most common interval was 36 months for both brain and spine (88% and 92% of centres).

Abdominal imaging

To detect renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic tumours the selected surveillance protocol recommended "MRI (or ultrasound) examinations of the abdomen every 12 months, beginning from the age of 16 years". Only one genetics centre did not commence abdominal imaging at age 16 years (MRI was offered from 18 years) but 12 centres offered abdominal imaging from an earlier age (youngest age 8 years). The imaging modality varied between centres e.g. MRI only (n = 9), ultrasonography only (with CT/MRI for suspected lesions) (n = 6) or combinations (e.g. alternating) of ultrasound and MRI (n = 6).

Phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) surveillance

All centres offered biochemical testing (urine or plasma catecholamine measurements) usually commencing between 5 and 10 years of age (age 11 in one centre). Several centres commented that they commenced surveillance earlier for "higher risk" cases (e.g. family history of PPGL and/or known PPGL-associated VHL variant).

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^115o2Gmb]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

HIF2-alpha inhibition with belzutifan in ocular von Hippel–Lindau disease — an oral small molecule HIF2-alpha inhibitor, belzutifan, received FDA approval on the basis of a phase 2 clinical trial, and preliminary findings suggest that HIF2-alpha inhibition may have efficacy for retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs). Because this systemic treatment avoids the direct damage of local ablation, systemic HIF2alpha inhibitors might provide a safer option for the management of juxtapapillary tumors (≤ 1.5 mm from disc edge) and macular tumors (< 3.0 mm from foveal center [foveola]), might also allow other (extrapapillary) tumors to be treated earlier without ablative therapies and might even play a role in suppression of RH formation, although how ocular screening of VHL patients on chronic HIF2alpha inhibition might differ from current guidelines still remains to be determined.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^112nfNjr]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Management recommendation — VHL ocular care — "Patients should be managed, whenever possible, by those with subspecialty training and/or with experience with VHL disease / RHs, and ideally within the context of a multidisciplinary center capable of providing multi-organ surveillance and access to genetic testing". The grading provided is "Evidence (type): IV Evidence (strength): D Recommendation (strength): 2A". Supporting context states, "We did not find published data with a direct comparison of screening outcomes among distinct models for management of VHL disease", and "There is at least limited evidence from retrospective studies on large longitudinal cohorts that good ocular outcomes can be achieved with regular surveillance at centers with experience in VHL disease".

### "Incidentally" discovered von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^1138CsVw]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing accessibility to genetic screening for cancer risk can lead to earlier surveillance and prevention, but with this comes the caveat of incidental identification of germline pathogenic gene variants. Here, we report a single institution case series of 6 otherwise healthy individuals with "incidental" Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease. These patients were found to have pathogenic germline variants in the VHL gene, after undergoing genetic testing for other purposes (5 for familial breast cancer risk and 1 to determine ancestry) but no VHL disease-associated tumors. The penetrance and expressivity of such incidental variants are not currently known, and therefore, no surveillance guidelines exist. Nevertheless, the association of these variants historically with high disease penetrance compels us to currently recommend active surveillance of their carriers with annual imaging of the brain, spine, and abdomen.

### Von Hippel Lindau disease: keep it in the family [^116Ttgfo]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) through three generations of the same family. First presentation was a young female with a 6-week history of headaches behind the eyes. On examination she was found to have bilateral retinal capillary haemangiomas (RCH). Preliminary diagnosis of VHL was suspected and further investigations confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient was found to have pancreatic and kidney lesions and her mother had a cerebellar haemangioblastoma. Following genetic testing, the VHL gene appeared in the 9-year-old boy. On recent presymptomatic ophthalmic screening, the child was found to have RCH. Both patient and child's RCHs were successfully managed with a variety of treatments.

### The impact of surgery on patients with von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors: an international patient survey [^1143muEA]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The survey material was developed in English, translated into native languages, and delivered online. The completion of the survey took the participants approximately 30 minutes. Data collected included demographics, symptoms, experiences with surgery, treatments, and the EQ-5D-5L. In order to assess patient preference, the following scenarios and options were presented in the questionnaire: "Imagine that you have not had VHL-related surgery in the past. You now have VHL-related cancer, but you are not yet eligible to have surgery on that tumor. You have the following options:"

The first scenario and options were as follows:

"Watch and wait": You will continue with regular doctor visits and monitor changes to your VHL-related tumor over time. At some point, if the tumor and/or tumor-associated cyst grows, you will need to have surgery.
"Take a pill": You will continue with regular doctor visits and monitor changes to your VHL-related tumor over time. At some point, if the tumor grows, you will need to have surgery. You will also take a pill once a day. This pill may have some side effects but could slow the growth of your VHL-related tumor and possibly delay the time to surgery.

The second scenario and options were as follows:

"Watch and wait": You will continue with regular doctor visits and monitor changes to your VHL-related tumor over time. At some point, if the tumor and/or tumor-associated cyst grows, you will need to have surgery.
"Take a pill": You will continue with regular doctor visits and monitor changes to your VHL-related tumor over time. At some point, if the tumor and/or tumor-associated cyst grows, you will need to have surgery. You will also take a pill once a day. This pill may have some side effects but could slow the growth of your VHL-related tumor and possibly delay the time until you need to have surgery. In addition, the pill may also slow the growth of other VHL-related tumors and/or tumor-associated cysts.

### The impact of surgery on patients with von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors: an international patient survey [^111cMJAW]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Experience with surgery by number of surgeries.

Patients with VHL-related tumors had an average health state (EQ-5D-5L, US tariff) of 0.728. Patients who had experienced 2 or more surgeries had an average health state of 0.705, patients who had one surgery had an average health state of 0.803, and patients who had no surgeries had an average health state of 0.825.

About 73.2% (n = 161) of patients indicated they would prefer to take a pill that would possibly delay the time until surgery, rather than watch and wait to see if the tumor would grow (Figure 3). When the scenario was modified to additionally include " In addition, the pill may also slow the growth of other VHL-related tumors and/or tumor-associated cysts, " it was even higher. Around 75.5% (n = 166) of patients indicated they would prefer to take a pill that would possibly delay the time until surgery, rather than watch and wait to see if the tumor would grow (Figure 4). The preference for a pill was affected by the number of previous surgeries. Specifically, of patients who have had no surgeries, 66.7% (n = 10) would take a pill; of patients who have had 1 surgery, 47.1% (n = 16) of patients would take a pill; and of patients who have had 2 or more surgeries, 78.9% (n = 135) would take a pill.

### Patient quality criteria for a multidisciplinary integrated care pathway for Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome… [^111KxXry]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract e13534 Background: The objective was to establish a comprehensive set of patient-driven recommendations for specialists and allied healthcare professionals for the care of individuals with the multiple neoplasia syndrome von Hippel-Lindau. VHL patients require multiple surgeries during the course of their lifetimes, due to cysts and tumors in various organs including the kidney, brain, eye, spine, pancreas, adrenal glands, and broad ligament/epididymis. Screening and care from multiple specialists form the backbone of their care, yet this is rarely coordinated in an optimal manner. Methods: The Dutch VHL patient organization initiated this process, and approached specialists and expert patients for input.

Using components of consensus methodology, a 20-member multidisciplinary panel produced an integrated care pathway relating to the provision of care for VHL patients by patients, medical specialists, specialist nurses and allied healthcare professionals. Items were developed by 3 rounds of email correspondence in which the basis was formed for a consensus meeting which constituted the third round of review. The fourth and final round was an email review of the consensus output. Results: The panel agreed on recommendations for the optimal quality of care for VHL patients, in the form of a decision tree, which is supervised by a nurse specialist as a main contact point. These items were grouped under categories of "Diagnosis" and "Patient Pathway" and included recommendations on training, communication, and quality assessment as well as specific items related to VHL diagnosis clinics, non-academic treatment clinics, and follow-up survivor groups.

The Netherlands has 3 official Expert Reference Centers for VHL care, and the patient organization and allied specialists are planning to publish this protocol, while implementing its practice in those 3 sites. Conclusions: Medical specialists and specialist nurses play a vital role alongside allied healthcare professionals to provide care to people with VHL and their families. Yet VHL patients and their families are the experts most acquainted with their own unmet needs. We present a set of standards and consensus recommendations from the patient perspective for the roles for these practitioners to provide optimal VHL care.

These recommendations could form the basis for facilitated development of comprehensive integrated pathways for any pleiotropic neoplasia syndrome, and represent best-practice collaboration between patient organizations and national expertise centers to provide value-based healthcare.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^116q749y]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of individuals attending NHS specialist services for VHL disease

Data were obtained from 22 UK regional genetics centres. Overall 842 individuals (393 males, 449 females) with a clinical and/or molecular diagnosis of VHL disease attended one of the centres over the audit period (2012–2017). A pathogenic VHL variant had been detected in 750 individuals but not in 64 (diagnostic rate 92%). In addition, 74 individuals (35 male, 39 female) with a prior risk of 50% (affected parent) were also seen. Individuals at 50% risk were screened as per individuals with confirmed VHL disease in all centres until (a) their status was resolved by genetic testing or (b) they reached the age at which screening was discontinued if no evidence of VHL disease had appeared. The age at which screening was discontinued varied between 40 and 65 years with a median age of 50 years.

The number of individuals seen at each centre ranged from 1 to 101 (mean 38.2, median = 33). The UK population in 2016 was 65.11 million giving a maximum prevalence of 1.29 per 100,000 population (1 per 77,340) but excluding the patients from the two regions where data ascertainment appeared to be incomplete gave an estimated maximum prevalence of 1.4 per 100,000 population (1 per 71,480). Counting half of the individuals at 50% prior risk further increased this to 1.46 per 100,000 population (1 per 68,493).

There were 33 deaths over the study period (mean age at death 50.4 years, range 25–82 years) and 17 deaths were considered to be related to a complication of, or treatment for, VHL disease (mean age at death 48.3 years, range 25 to 68 years). For 11 cases, mean age at death 58.8 years, range 40 to 82 years, the cause of death was not considered to be linked to VHL disease (e.g. myocardial infaction) and for 5 cases the relationship to VHL disease was uncertain (mean age at death 47.8 years, range 31 to 57 years).

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^111TGUyW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Summary of ocular surveillance and early treatment principles in von Hippel–Lindau disease — the relative rarity and clinical heterogeneity of VHL disease have hampered the development of prospective studies and clinical trials, and the evidence base for recommendations is generally limited; creation of a tumor registry to collect data in a standardized format is needed to generate evidence based recommendations. The availability of genetic testing offers identification of those with VHL disease prior to any clinical manifestations, and diagnosis shortly after birth enables targeted and timely surveillance of individuals at very high risk of RH development. Periodic dilated eye examination remains a mainstay and both an early stage examination schedule as well as safe and effective ablation of small extrapapillary/extramacular RHs are supported by retrospective series. Consideration of the morbidity caused by larger RHs and the limited current treatment options for advanced ocular VHL disease complete the rationale for early identification and prompt treatment of extramacular/extrapapillary RHs as a means of preserving vision. New systemic pharmaceutical agents targeting HIF2alpha could assist in control of RHs and might allow particularly early treatment for all RHs, especially those in the macula and juxtapapillary region.

### Unsuspected Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome in acute-onset resistant hypertension [^112n8SBP]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The discovery of adrenal lesions during routine testing for hypertension requires focused consideration for adrenal overproduction of cortisol, aldosterone or metanephrines. An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman presented with headaches, diaphoresis and hot flushes with grossly elevated urine catecholamines, normetanephrines and norepinephrine levels, yet normal metanephrines, epinephrine/epinephrine, cortisol and aldosterone levels. Subsequent functional uptake studies and scans identified bilateral adrenal adenomas consistent with phaeochromocytomas. There was no family history of phaeochromocytomas or familial syndromes; however, a targeted genetic analysis for causes of familial phaeochromocytomas identified a heterozygous germline mutation in the VHL gene consistent with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In this case, the identification of the VHL mutation led to careful screening and detection of clinically occult central nervous system hemangioblastomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Verified genetic mutations facilitated best practices for long-term surveillance protocols, preconception counselling and screening of blood relatives. The patient responded well to surgical treatment and has ongoing multidisciplinary long-term surveillance.

### Metastatic pheochromocytoma in an asymptomatic 12-year-old with Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^111r7Wds]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare chromaffin cell tumor that may be associated with a genetic predisposition, such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by a predisposition to multiple tumors, including retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas. The classic presentation of pheochromocytoma is episodic hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis. In the pediatric population, 40% of pheochromocytomas have a hereditary basis. We present a case of metastatic pheochromocytoma in a child with VHL and discuss the relevant current medical literature.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^114ASxZd]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Ocular von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) surveillance — screening schedule and examination recommends that individuals with known or suspected VHL disease should undergo periodic ocular screening with dilated ophthalmoscopy. Ocular screening should begin within 12 months after birth and continue throughout life, and should occur approximately every 6–12 months until age 30 years, and then at least yearly after age 30 years; the frequency may be influenced by the quality of the previous examination obtained in young children, and examination under anesthesia may be considered in children in whom a detailed office examination is not possible. For pregnancy, ocular screening should be performed prior to a planned pregnancy, and every 6–12 months during pregnancy.

### Can AI-generated clinical vignettes in Japanese Be used medically and linguistically? [^112Thkmy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the greatest challenge in developing AI-generated clinical vignettes is ensuring high medical accuracy. Regarding the vignettes' medical accuracy, critical issues such as insufficient information, missing physical examination data, inappropriate tests, inadequate assessments, prescription of unnecessary medication, dosages exceeding the recommended amounts, and non-recommended management were observed. In particular, caution is necessary with outputs that include dosages adopted abroad that differ from those used in Japan, prescriptions of contraindicated drugs, and those inappropriate from the standpoint of antimicrobial resistance. These outputs could lead to medical errors if used unmodified by healthcare workers with insufficient knowledge in the relevant field because they may not recognize these mistakes. Another inappropriate output was that some clinical vignettes suggested regular follow-up observations for conditions that did not require them, even recommending checkups every few months. Additionally, there was one case that presented an unknown disease name. Non-existent drug names were occasionally observed.

This study evaluated 202 AI-generated clinical vignettes created using a single input. Although only one input–output cycle was performed in this study, it is possible that better vignettes could be produced through repeated similar inputs. At present, prompt modification is considered the most accurate method to improve the output within a correctable range. By modifying the prompts, it is possible to suppress unpredictable outputs, align the output with the instructions, and refine the text. Moreover, there is a significant possibility of creating higher accuracy and more desirable cases for users by instructing the generative AI on specific points to be revised for each individual case. When using this generative AI and the output clinical vignettes for medical education or other purposes, it is possible to create clinical vignettes with less effort by carefully evaluating and modifying the appropriateness of the test selection and dosage of therapeutic drugs while confirming the patient's medical history.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^112R9iJc]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ocular disease — A small retrospective series reported higher lesion yield on imaging versus exam notes: "In 12 eyes with discrete lesions identified… 46 lesions were identified on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography, compared with only 15 lesions in exam notes". Imaging nuances included: "For 5 eyes that were evaluated with gaze-steered images, 18% of lesions could only be seen on images with gaze steering. One of 20 eyes had a lesion that was seen on examination but missed on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiographic imaging". Use is positioned as adjunctive: "such images do not replace extended ophthalmoscopy", there was "general agreement that photography can be valuable to monitor lesions", and "retinal imaging is best considered discretionary and ancillary to a dilated ophthalmoscopic examination by an ophthalmologist proficient in management of ocular VHL disease".

### "Incidentally" discovered von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^116pRuvX]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Historically, patients referred for genetic counseling and germline VHL testing were at risk of a known familial VHL variant, or patients with a personal or family history raising suspicion for VHL disease (eg, early-onset ccRCC [≤ 46-years-old], hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or 2+ VHL-associated lesions). This population was characterized by a referral bias based on presence of tumor(s) in the proband or their families. The prevalence (1:36 000), high penetrance (almost 97%), and expressivity of VHL disease were tabulated based on this referral bias.

Here, we describe 6 patients incidentally discovered to carry germline pathogenic VHL mutations, presenting to our institution over the last 2 years. Standard VHL imaging revealed no evidence of VHL tumors at presentation. For such unsuspected VHL germline variants without clinical stigmata of VHL disease, we coin the term "incidental VHL disease". It is unclear whether these patients will develop VHL-related tumors during their lifetime, however given the historical penetrance and associated morbidity and mortality of VHL lesions, we opted to apply the standard VHL patient surveillance protocol.

Currently, the expanding practice of germline testing via multigene panels that include hereditary cancer risk genes across multiple cancer types provides insights into the genomes of completely asymptomatic patients. The result is the identification of germline variants in unexpected genes, linked to unsuspected hereditary risks for cancer. This is not a VHL-specific phenomenon and encompasses many cancer-predisposing genes. Penetrance, namely the percentage of individuals harboring the pathogenic variant who express any phenotype of the disease, may be influenced by many factors, including gender, age, genetic (specific germline variant, genetic background inherited from the parents), and environmental variables. These "incidental" findings in patients without disease-specific lesions are likely to challenge our established view of the penetrance and expressivity of inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. Moreover, established guidelines on how to clinically follow these patients are lacking. We recommend referral to specialized high-risk cancer clinics for surveillance recommendations.

### Management of retinal hemangioblastoma in Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^115pWGcx]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the current state of diagnosis and management of retinal hemangioblastoma and retinal vascular proliferation arising from von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.

Methods

A review of the literature was performed. Consensus was reached among authors regarding current practice, with reference to published data where possible.

Results

von Hippel-Lindau disease and its ocular manifestations are relatively rare, and there is limited evidence in the literature on which to base management. There was consensus on core principles, including 1) recognition and diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease when present, with appropriate referral for care of this potentially lethal systemic condition; 2) regular ophthalmic evaluation for individuals with von Hippel-Lindau disease, to identify and offer timely treatment for new or active retinal hemangioblastomas; 3) ablative treatment of retinal hemangioblastomas that can be safely destroyed, to lower risk of vision loss; 4) observation or consideration of nonablative treatments for retinal hemangioblastomas that cannot be safely destroyed; and 5) observation of asymptomatic retinal vascular proliferation, with consideration of vitrectomy for lesions exerting effects on vision.

Conclusion

Ocular outcomes can be gratifying in many cases with appropriate management. Improved understanding of the molecular basis for the disease creates an opportunity for rational design of better therapies.

### The impact of surgery on patients with von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors: an international patient survey [^112D897s]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the top symptoms among patients with VHL-related tumors, as shown in this study, is fatigue, with surgery negatively affecting the energy a patient has in general. Altogether, there is a mental toll of an approaching surgery, with most patients agreeing that they felt nervous, anxious, and scared before their most recent surgery, as well as about unforeseen upcoming surgeries. Thus, reducing the need for surgical intervention was a top treatment goal, with about half of patients wanting to reduce their number of surgeries with a new treatment option.

Considering the reported impact that surgeries have on mental health, as discussed above, when offered the choice to either watch and wait to see how their tumor develops, or take a daily pill that might delay surgery, almost three quarters of patients would take the pill — even if it had mild/moderate side effects.

In light of the study's findings on the impact of surgery on patients with VHL disease and their treatment preferences, potential avenues for future research may encompass the exploration of nonsurgical treatment options. This could involve the investigation of non-surgical modalities like targeted therapies, with the aim of alleviating tumor burden or delaying tumor growth in VHL disease. Furthermore, additional research efforts are warranted to deepen our understanding of the effects of VHL-related surgeries on patient reported outcomes, more specifically, mental health and quality of life.

The design of this study was cross-sectional, meaning the information captured from the patient survey is at a single point in time. Therefore, components of the study cannot be used to demonstrate cause and effect. However, the external validity (the ability of a study to be generalized to the real world) tends to be higher with non-interventional trials compared to clinical trials. Patient-reported outcomes tools utilized in the survey are not specifically validated in VHL. However, the quantitative survey was validated with patient piloting to ensure that the survey was methodologically rigorous in the collection of data. Patients were not recruited directly from a study physician, so VHL diagnosis was self-reported. In addition, another limitation of this study is the overrepresentation of female patients, which could be attributed to the survey's sampling design. However, patients were recruited from a recognized patient advocacy group, VHL alliance, who have a goal of improving the quality of life and health outcomes for VHL patients.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma: a call to action [^111mzuWT]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

While the molecular and genetic bases of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease have been extensively investigated, limited evidence is available to guide diagnosis, local or systemic therapy, and follow-up. The aim of the current review is to summarize the ongoing trials both in preclinical and clinical setting regarding VHL disease management.

Recent Findings

Although genotype/phenotype correlations have been described, there is considerable inter and intra-familiar heterogeneity in VHL disease. Genetic anticipation has been reported in VHL disease. From a clinical point of view, expert-opinion-based protocols suggest testing those patients with any blood relative of an individual diagnosed with VHL disease, those with at least 1 or more suggestive neoplasms or patients presenting with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) diagnosed at a less than 40 years old, and/or multiple ccRCC. Clinical research is focused on safety and efficacy of systemic agents for patients with VHL-related ccRCC, with the aim to possibly preserve kidney function and improve patient survival.

Summary

To date, preclinical and clinical research on the topic is scarce and clinical guidelines are not supported by strong validation studies.

### Synthetic medical education in dermatology leveraging generative artificial intelligence [^114GSS6C]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While inherently driven by visual evaluation, medical instruction on many skin and soft tissue pathologies is inseparable from the holistic clinical presentation contextualizing the disease process, and standardized exams like the USMLE rely heavily upon text-based vignettes for these pathologies. Furthermore, the vernacular surrounding the description of skin lesions is key to the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous disease. LLMs offer a distinct capability to expand the availability of text-based vignettes for common dermatologic conditions in medical education. Furthermore, current off-the-shelf LLMs like GPT offer flexibility in expanding on the clinical vignette beyond the initial output, evolving to meet the needs of the individual student as subsequent questions arise. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of utilizing GPT 4.0, OpenAI's latest public-facing foundation model, to generate high-quality clinical vignettes for the purpose of medical education.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^1119yW6Y]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The identification of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in 1993 and the subsequent characterisation of > 1000 germline pathogenic variants has enabled genetic diagnosis and pre-symptomatic testing to be made available to most affected families and facilitates early diagnosis, particularly in those without a family history (up to 20% of probands result from de novo mutations). Pre-symptomatic testing is offered from early childhood and there is a high uptake, with those relatives who test negative being released from annual surveillance programmes and so increasing the cost-effectiveness of surveillance. Over the past two decades there has been a general consensus among expert opinions of the value of surveillance to detect VHL-related complications early (particularly for ocular and renal tumours) though the details (e.g. age at which screening is commenced and imaging modalities) can vary between centres and countries. However, there is little information on the "real world" implementation of such surveillance programmes within large countries and the extent of inter-centre variability (and its consequences). To address this knowledge deficit an audit was initiated to define the characteristics of services for patients and families with VHL disease across the United Kingdom (population ~65,110,000 Office for National Statistics 2016). Here we report the findings of this survey.

### The impact of surgery on patients with von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors: an international patient survey [^1174f3s6]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering the long-term impact of VHL on quality of life, mental health, and other factors like productivity, it is worthwhile to examine how diseases with limited treatment options can lead to physical and psychosocial impairments, as well as the potential impact of an approved and available systemic therapy. It has been scientifically evaluated that the outlook on cancer-related imaging/scans already has an impact on the mental health of the patients. So called "scanxiety", or the distress and/or anxiety occurring before, during, and after medical scans, describes the apprehension of getting poor results that is involved in the experience. Together with the prospect of VHL patients having to go for frequent imaging and subsequent surgeries, this may have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, mental health, and overall ability to cope with VHL disease.

The introduction of systemic therapy with the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor belzutifan has offered a novel therapeutic option for patients with VHL. Belzutifan was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2021 for treating adult patients with VHL disease who require therapy for RCC, CNS hemangioblastomas, or pNET, and do not require immediate surgery. The LITESPARK-004 trial demonstrated promising results, with belzutifan showing a 49% objective response rate (ORR) in RCC lesions, a 44%-76% ORR in CNS hemangioblastomas, as well as stabilization or regression of pNET tumors. This availability of a nonsurgical option may significantly alter the perspective of VHL patients on disease management and overall quality of life.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of VHL-related surgeries on patients' lives, and whether patients would prefer alternative treatment that could potentially alleviate the need for surgery.

Very early age at diagnosis of VHL-related neoplasia

Surveillance programmes look to balance comprehensive early detection with cost efficiency. To identify the extent to which current surveillance recommendations might miss some unusually early presentations of VHL-related tumours, each of the centres was asked to specify the number of such cases they had seen over the study period. There was one case of a retinal haemangioblastoma and none of a CNS haemangioblastoma younger than age 5 years, two individuals with RCC were diagnosed before 18 years and 7 with phaeochromocytoma were diagnosed < 10 years (youngest age 7 years).

Retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease — lesion location and early morphology are defined, with extrapapillary RHs arising > 1.5 mm from the optic disc and initially presenting as a red or grayish pinpoint lesion with diameter < 500 μm, whereas juxtapapillary RHs arise ≤ 1.5 mm from the optic disc and often show a variably pink-grey localized fullness that becomes more distinct and nodular with growth; RH is a benign, highly vascular neoplasm that is typically asymptomatic at early stages but can cause vision loss due to exudation, fibrosis, hemorrhage, or retinal detachment as tumors enlarge.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease: genetics and role of genetic counseling in a multiple neoplasia syndrome [^115oxZwg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is one of the most common inherited neoplasia syndromes and is characterized by highly vascular tumors of the eyes, brain, and spine, as well as benign and malignant tumors and/or cysts of the kidneys, adrenal medullae and sympathetic paraganglia, endolymphatic sac, epididymis, and broad ligament. Since the discovery of the VHL gene in 1993, more than 900 families with VHL have been identified and examined. Genetic testing for VHL is widely available and will detect a disease-causing mutation in rate 95% to 100% of individuals who have a clinical diagnosis of VHL, making it the standard of care for diagnosis of VHL. Furthermore, genetic testing for VHL is indicated in some individuals with seemingly sporadic VHL-related tumor types, as ≤ 10% of pheochromocytoma or early-onset renal cell carcinoma and ≤ 40% of CNS hemangioblastoma harbor germline VHL mutations without a family history or additional features of VHL disease. The majority of VHL mutations are private, but there are also well-characterized founder mutations. VHL is a complex, multiorgan disease that spans the breadth of oncology subspecialties, and, as such, providers in these subspecialties should be aware of when to consider a diagnosis of VHL, when to refer a patient to a genetics specialist for consideration of gene testing, and, perhaps most importantly, how to communicate this sensitive information in an age-appropriate manner to at-risk families. This review will provide state-of-the-art information regarding the genetics of VHL and will serve as a key reference for nongenetics professionals who encounter patients with VHL.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^111kBAzc]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease — ocular surveillance after age 30 years — has a recommended frequency of eye evaluation annually after age 30 years. In longitudinal data, many patients over 50 years old did not manifest new RHs from one year to the next, a small number did so, even between 60 and 70 years of age. For broader context, screening recommendations in older adults call for a comprehensive eye evaluation every 1–3 years for those ages 55 to 64 years, and every 1–2 years for those ages 65 and older, even in the absence of any risk factors.

Results

Organisation of NHS specialist services for VHL disease

Twenty-two Regional Genetics Centres were contacted to participate in the national audit and completed the audit questionnaire (see Supplementary material). Four centres reported that they did not have a formal VHL surveillance clinic (one because of low numbers, one because there were two clinics running at other hospitals in their region and two undertook individual non-specialist clinic reviews). Of the 18 formal surveillance clinics for which information was obtained, 16 were led by the clinical genetics service and two by the endocrinology service. Of the clinical genetics service led clinics, most (11/16) were multidisciplinary. The most frequent specialties represented in the multidisciplinary clinics were ophthalmology (n = 8), endocrinology (n = 4), urology (n = 3) followed by paediatrics, neurology, nephrology, radiology (each n = 1).

### The impact of surgery on patients with von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors: an international patient survey [^117ArYvz]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a rare hereditary neoplastic disorder caused by mutations in the VHL gene. Treatment options for patients are limited to multiple surgeries dispersed between regular scans, watchful waiting and treatments that preserve organ function.

Methods

An international, cross-sectional survey comprising patients in the United States (US), Canada (CA), the United Kingdom (UK), France (FR), and Germany (DE) was conducted. Patients were recruited via the VHL Alliance; data were collected between Dec 2021 and May 2022. For inclusion, patients must have renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), and/or central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CNS-Hb).

Results

220 patients (68.2% female, median age 40.0, median disease duration 15.8years) in the US (n = 108), CA (n = 37), the UK (n = 21), FR (n = 3), and DE (n = 51) completed the study. 205 (93.2%) patients had experienced surgery; n = 171 (77.7%) had experienced multiple surgeries (median number of surgeries, 4.0). 166 (n = 75.5%) patients recorded data on their most recent surgery. Of these, patients reported that their most recent surgery worsened (scored 1–3) their fatigue (51.8%, n = 86), mental health (51.2%, n = 85), and ability to go about daily life (45.2%, n = 75). 47.3% (n = 104) of patients selected reduce the number of surgeries as a top treatment goal. 73% (n = 161) of patients indicated they would prefer to take a pill which would possibly delay the time until surgery.

Conclusion

Surgery negatively impacts the lives of patients, leading to a worsening in their fatigue, mental health, and ability to go about daily life.

Implications For Practice

The findings highlight the significant burden of repeated surgeries on patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease, negatively impacting their fatigue, mental health, and daily functioning. Patients express a strong preference for treatments that reduce or delay the need for surgery, with nearly three-quarters indicating they would opt for a pill to achieve this. These insights underscore the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies that prioritize preserving the quality of life while managing tumor progression. Clinicians should consider patient preferences when discussing treatment plans, and further research into non-surgical interventions is warranted to address these unmet needs.

### Tumors in Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome: from head to toe-comprehensive state-of-the-art review [^113JWuhs]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary tumor disease that arises owing to germline mutations in the VHL gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Patients with VHL may develop multiple benign and malignant tumors involving various organ systems, including retinal hemangioblastomas (HBs), central nervous system (CNS) HBs, endolymphatic sac tumors, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic cystadenomas, pancreatic cysts, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, renal cysts, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas. The VHL/hypoxia-inducible factor pathway is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of VHL-related tumors. The diagnosis of VHL can be made clinically when the characteristic clinical history and findings have manifested, such as the presence of two or more CNS HBs. Genetic testing for heterozygous germline VHL mutation may also be used to confirm the diagnosis of VHL. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with VHL. Familiarity with the clinical and imaging manifestations of the various VHL-related tumors is important for early detection and guiding appropriate management. The purpose of this article is to discuss the molecular cytogenetics and clinical manifestations of VHL, review the characteristic multimodality imaging features of the various VHL-related tumors affecting multiple organ systems, and discuss the latest advances in management of VHL, including current recommendations for surveillance and screening. © RSNA, 2018 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

### Centralization of care for rare genetic syndromes associated with cancer: improving outcomes and advancing research on VHL disease [^112ieUSL]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare genetic syndrome caused by a germline pathogenic variant in one VHL allele. Any somatic event disrupting the other allele induces VHL protein (pVHL) loss of function, ultimately leading to patients developing multiple tumours in multiple organs at multiple timepoints, and reducing life expectancy. Treatment of this complex, rare disease is often fragmented, as patients visit specialist clinicians in isolation at different medical centres. Consequently, patients can receive sub-optimal treatment that results in decreased quality of life and a poor experience of health care systems. In 2021, we established a comprehensive clinical centre at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, devoted to VHL disease. The centre provides a structured programme for the diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of patients alongside research into VHL disease and involves a multidisciplinary team of dedicated physicians. This programme demonstrates the benefits of care centralization, including concentration of knowledge and services, synergy and multidisciplinary management, improved networking and patient resources, reducing health care costs, and fostering research and innovation. VHL disease provides an ideal model to assess the advantages of centralizing care for rare disease and represents an unparalleled opportunity to broaden our understanding of cancer biology in general.

Molecular genetic testing is recommended for all individuals with known or suspected VHL disease and all individuals with a single VHL-associated tumor and negative history like our patient. Once the diagnosis is established, surveillance evaluation includes: neurological exam with baseline brain/spine imaging; ophthalmic exam; audiological exam; abdominal ultrasound; blood pressure; and genetic consultation. Early identification can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality related to this disease.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease and rapidly progressing pheochromocytomas in siblings [^117WWrwu]. Familial Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited condition with a predisposition to the development of a variety of tumors including pheochromocytomas. A number of cancer surveillance protocols for patients with VHL have been developed, all of which are based on expert opinion. We report a case of two brothers with a strong family history of VHL type 2 due to a pathogenic germline VHL variant, specifically, a surface missense substitution, with a rapidly progressive clinical course that both presented with a large adrenal mass. Both brothers presented with large pheochromocytomas, the earliest presentation being at age 7, despite routine screening. The rapid progression and early presentation of these patients raises an important discussion around the commonly used surveillance protocols for pheochromocytoma in pediatric patients with VHL and missense mutations. We conclude that a more accelerated surveillance protocol may be adequate for VHL families with a high pheochromocytoma risk.

### "Incidentally" discovered von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^1131SU9e]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the patients presented here carry classic VHL pathogenic variants. It is noteworthy, though, that 2 of these patients carry the VHL c.598C > T, p.R200W pathogenic variant, which is linked to Chuvash polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and thrombotic episodes when present in the homozygous/compound heterozygous state. Classic VHL-associated tumors have so far not been reported in families with heterozygous Chuvash variant, indicating that this germline variant may lead to VHL disease, albeit with reduced penetrance. Anecdotally, we follow one family with this Chuvash variant at our center, in which the affected members developed renal cell carcinoma and metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (O. I. observation).

In conclusion, this case-series highlights a growing phenomenon in cancer genetic counseling and testing: identification of incidental VHL variants. Long-term surveillance of these patients is required in order to understand the penetrance of incidentally discovered pathogenic variants not only for VHL but also for other hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.

With increasing use of genetic testing, and widespread clinical use of next-generation sequencing around the corner, this issue is likely to become more prominent.

Affected patients are at increased risk for developing multiple synchronous or metachronous benign or malignant, cystic, and vascular neoplasms of various organs. The characteristic neoplasms associated with von Hippel-Lindau are hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system and retina, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma, but other lesions are well recognized. Pancreatic lesions, both primary and metastatic, are common, and several differential diagnostic possibilities must be considered.

### Use of von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) mutation status to predict objective response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [^113dhqr2]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 5012 Background: The clinical response to VEGF-targeted therapy in metastatic RCC is robust, yet variability in outcome exists. VHLis often mutated in RCC, but the relation to therapeutic outcome is unclear. Identification of tumor molecular characteristics associated with outcome would aid in patient selection and interpretation of clinical trials. Materials and Methods: Patients with metastatic, clear-cell RCC with available baseline frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor samples who received VEGF-targeted monotherapy with sunitinb, sorafenib, axitinib or bevacizumab at Cleveland Clinic or University of California San Francisco, were included. Patient characteristics. VHLgene status and objective response rate were documented. ORR was investigator-assessed per RECIST criteria. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression models were used to assess ORR in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.

Results: One-hundred twenty-three patients were evaluable. The ORR was 36. 5% for the entire cohort. VHLmutation remained an independent prognostic factor associated with improved ORR when multiple clinical prognostic factors were also considered. Conclusion: This is the first large study testing the impact of. VHLmutation on response to VEGF-targeted agents in metastatic RCC. Although objective responses were more likely among patients with mutated VHLgene, lack of VHLmutation did not preclude a response. Additional tissue analysis and identification of biomarkers relevant to response to VEGF-targeted agents in metastatic RCC are warranted.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^113ATcPu]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited tumour predisposition syndrome and a paradigm for the importance of early diagnosis and surveillance. However, there is limited information on the "real world" management of VHL disease.

Methods

A national audit of VHL disease in the United Kingdom.

Results

VHL disease was managed mostly via specialist clinics coordinated through regional clinical genetics services (but frequently involving additional specialties). Over the study period, 19 genetic centres saw 842 individuals (393 males, 449 females) with a clinical and/or molecular diagnosis of VHL disease and 74 individuals (35 male, 39 female) with a prior risk of 50% (affected parent). All centres offered retinal, central nervous system and abdominal surveillance to affected individuals and at-risk relatives though surveillance details differed between centres (but complied with international recommendations). Renal lesions detected on the first surveillance scan were, on average, larger than those detected during subsequent scans and the larger the diameter at detection the greater the likelihood of early intervention.

Conclusions

In a state-funded health care system individuals with a rare inherited cancer predisposition syndrome are generally able to access appropriate surveillance and patient management is improved compared to historical data. The "real world" data from this study will inform the future development of VHL management protocols.

1–4] A multidisciplinary approach is required for the evaluation, and in some cases, the management of individuals with VHL. A case manager or nurse navigator may be helpful in certain scenarios. Specialists who care for individuals with VHL may include urologic oncology surgeons, neurosurgeons, general surgeons, ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, neurologists, medical oncologists, genetic counselors, and medical geneticists. The significant burden of VHL leads to challenges, including high health care costs. Microtubule Regulation and Cilia Centrosome Control Emerging data point to the importance of pVHL-mediated control of the primary cilium and the cilia centrosome cycle. The nonmotile primary cilium acts as a mechanosensor, regulates cell signaling, and controls cellular entry into mitosis. The loss of primary ciliary function results in the loss of the cell's ability to maintain planar cell polarity; thus ultimately results in cyst formation. The loss of pVHL results in the loss of the primary cilium. pVHL binds to and stabilizes microtubules in a glycogen synthase 3–dependent fashion. The loss of pVHL, or expression of variant pVHL in cells, also results in unstable astral microtubules, dysregulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, and an increase in aneuploidy. Tumors larger than 3 cm may increase in grade as they grow, and metastasis may occur. RCCs often remain asymptomatic for long periods of time. Retinal Hemangioblastomas Retinal manifestations, which were first reported more than a century ago, were one of the first recognized VHL features. Retinal hemangioblastomas are one of the most common manifestations of VHL and are present in more than 50% of patients. Retinal involvement is one of the earliest manifestations of VHL, with a mean age of onset at 25 years. One study suggested that visual impairment severity may depend on a patient's VHL genotype. Patients with symptomatic retinal lesions often have many large retinal hemangioblastomas. Long-term follow-up studies demonstrate that most retinal lesions grow slowly and that new lesions do not develop frequently.

### Consensus guidelines for ocular surveillance of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^115B81rc]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease — genetic testing and evaluation: Those at risk for VHL disease should receive appropriate medical evaluation and genetic testing / counseling, and children at-risk should undergo genetic testing early in life to maximize the benefit of surveillance and avoid unnecessary surveillance in those negative; the presence of even a solitary RH should prompt appropriate medical evaluation and genetic testing / counseling irrespective of patient age, and in patients with a single RH genetic testing can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of VHL, whereas patients with multiple RHs already meet the clinical criteria for VHL even in the absence of finding a VHL gene mutation; for the patient, knowledge of the specific mutation is important because certain manifestations may exhibit genotype-phenotype correlations that may predict the likelihood of specific tumors forming.

Discussion

We report the results of a national audit of VHL disease performed across 22 regional clinical genetics centres. The number of patients seen in each centre was variable with higher numbers in centres with a larger catchment area and/or longstanding dedicated specialist clinics. Within the UK there is no nationally commissioned service for VHL disease surveillance, but there was a high degree of similarity between the different regional services. In most centres the specialist clinic was led by staff from clinical genetics. This arrangement reflects the early establishment of dedicated VHL specialist clinics in some UK genetics centres and the multisystem nature of VHL disease that means that it does not entirely fall under any specific medical or surgical specialty. We found variability in the organisation of VHL clinical services with some centres having up to four different specialties represented in their clinic, whilst other centres offered a less centralised clinic model. A multidisciplinary or "one-stop" service model can be more convenient for patients and families and reduce the number of hospital visits, though it is unknown whether such an arrangement improves clinical outcomes. With a large number of clinical specialties potentially involved in clinical care, our experience is that a key factor for an optimal service is that a named clinician coordinates their multifaceted care. This audit was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, during which some centres adopted telemedicine approaches to clinical care. We anticipate that some of the developments put in place during the pandemic (e.g. virtual clinics and digital retinal imaging techniques) might be retained in order to improve efficiency and patient compliance.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^112tD5mt]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

It was apparent that each centre appeared to be following the "3 cm rule" i.e. observing small RCC until they reach this size and then undertaking renal sparing surgery (though when ablative strategies were used treatment might be instigated for lesions 2–3 cm diameter). We note that though the frequency of early intervention increased with tumour size, there was apparently considerable heterogeneity in progression rates with some RCC < 2 cm diameter proceeding to intervention within 12 months. Again, this finding would suggest that if screening intervals are to be lengthened, then in "real-world scenarios" careful monitoring of any lesions detected would be initially required to establish growth rates of individual lesions. Over the past three decades, the adoption of renal surveillance programmes and nephron-sparing surgery in VHL disease has reduced the risk of death from RCC and the incidence of end-stage renal failure following renal surgery.

Most variability between the recommended surveillance and that which was being offered in practice was for central nervous system haemangioblastomas, with multiple centres not offering regular imaging. Nevertheless, it was noticeable that 62% of cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas diagnosed in the study period were detected at an asymptomatic stage by a surveillance MRI scan. This represents a major shift over the past three decades in UK clinical practice, as in earlier studies, almost all haemangioblastomas presented symptomatically. Though, in general, completely asymptomatic haemangioblastomas are surgically removed only infrequently and non-cystic haemangioblastomas may not enlarge over a period of years (and so the prognosis of small asymptomatic lesions can be difficult to predict), CNS imaging can detect asymptomatic syringomyelia which may require intervention and also identify markers of progression such as rapid growth and an associated cyst. Knowledge of asymptomatic lesions that are progressively enlarging may allow more considered planning of surgical intervention and reduce the risk of late presentation. The availability of medical treatments such as the HIF-2 antagonist belzutifan for the treatment of VHL disease will provide further impetus for early detection.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^112rseMJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterised by predisposition to multiple tumour types and caused by germline pathogenic variants in the VHL tumour suppressor gene. The expression of VHL disease is quite variable, onset may be in infancy or in the seventh decade. The major tumour types are retinal and central nervous system (CNS) haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), phaeochromocytoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNET) and endolymphatic sac tumours (ELST). In addition, renal, pancreatic and epididiymal cysts are common with increasing age. Clinical diagnostic criteria for VHL disease were defined in 1964 (1) a single VHL-related neoplasm such as a haemangioblastoma or RCC if there is a confirmed family history of VHL disease or, (2) in sporadic cases, two haemangioblastomas or a haemangioblastoma and a second VHL-related tumour). During the 1980s and 1990s there were multiple descriptions of large kindreds and multicentre patient cohorts that established the high age-related risks of retinal and CNS haemangioblastomas and RCC (each > 70% lifetime risk) in most families, and interfamilial variations in frequency of phaeochromocytoma susceptibility. Based on these high age-related risks it was suggested that affected individuals and their at-risk relatives should be offered regular surveillance to detect complications (especially retinal haemangioblastomas and RCC) at an early stage in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Subsequently it was reported that the adoption of surveillance programmes was associated with an increase in the proportion of retinal haemangioblastoma that were detected at an early (asymptomatic) stage, a reduction in the age at diagnosis of RCC and increased survival. With the adoption of annual renal surveillance, it was recognised that RCC could be detected at an early stage and monitored until they reached a diameter of 3 cm before surgical treatment, with minimal risk of metastatic disease. Furthermore as there is a high risk of further ipsilateral and contralateral RCC, the recommended management is nephron-sparing subtotal nephrectomy (or localised ablation using RFA or cryosurgery) in order to preserve renal function for as long as possible.

### Endocrine manifestations of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^115aToZ5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene that is characterized by the occurrence of multiple endocrine and nonendocrine lesions. This review focuses on the endocrine manifestations of VHL disease. Pancreatic neuroendocrine proliferations (ductuloinsular complexes, islet dysplasia, endocrine microadenoma, and neuroendocrine tumors), pheochromocytomas, and extra-adrenal paragangliomas are important endocrine manifestations of VHL disease. They frequently display characteristic clinical, biochemical, and histopathologic features that, although not pathognomonic, can be helpful in suggesting VHL disease as the underlying etiology and distinguishing these tumors from sporadic cases. Recent improvements in treatment and outcomes of renal cell carcinomas have allowed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors to emerge as a significant source of metastatic disease, making the accurate recognition and classification of these neoplasms by the pathologist of utmost importance to determine prognosis, treatment, and follow-up strategies for affected patients.

### Hemangioblastoma diagnosis and surveillance in Von Hippel-Lindau disease: a consensus statement [^112TnQx4]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hemangioblastomas are a frequent underlying cause of neurological morbidity and death in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Although these benign tumors can cause significant neurological debility when undetected and untreated, unified evidence-based surveillance recommendations for VHL patients have not been established. To develop consensus recommendations, the VHL Alliance established an expert committee, named the International VHL Surveillance Guidelines Consortium, to define surveillance recommendations.

Methods

The Central Nervous System (CNS) Hemangioblastoma Subcommittee of the Guidelines Consortium was formed as a multidisciplinary team of experts in the diagnosis and management of hemangioblastomas. Recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network Categories of Evidence and Consensus categorization after a comprehensive literature review.

Results

Published studies (n = 49) that discussed age at onset, MRI frequency, natural history of VHL, and the risks and benefits of surveillance were analyzed. Based on this analysis, the authors recommend that clinical evaluation (yearly) be used as the primary screening tool for hemangioblastomas in VHL. The subcommittee suggests that screening be performed between the ages of 11 and 65 years, or with the onset of symptoms, for synchronicity with other testing regimens in VHL. The subcommittee also recommends that baseline MRI be first performed at the age of 11 years (suggested 2B, level of evidence D) or after identification of neurological symptoms or signs (if earlier) and continue every 2 years (recommended 2A, level of evidence A).

Conclusions

The CNS Hemangioblastoma Subcommittee of the International VHL Surveillance Guidelines Consortium here proposes guidelines that aim to increase the early detection of VHL-associated hemangioblastomas to reduce their morbidity and mortality.

Reasons given for wanting to take a pill were "worry about the tumor getting bigger" (77.0%, n = 124), "wanting to delay time to surgery" (57.1%, n = 92), "risk of complications or side effect from surgery" (52.8%, n = 85), "chances of survival" (44.7%, n = 72), "risk that I might have other VHL-related tumors" (44.1%, n = 71), and "length of recovery time expected from surgery" (38.5%, n = 62). A vast majority of the patients would be willing to take a pill (strongly agree or agree) that could slow the growth of their VHL-related tumor and delay the time until surgery. Approximately, 97.5% (n = 157) of patients would take a pill if it increased their overall chances of survival. Around 95.6% (n = 154) of patients would take a pill, even if it had mild side effects, while 64.6% (n = 104) of patients would take a pill, even if it had moderate side effects. Roughly, 92.5% (n = 149) of patients would agree to take a pill if their doctor recommends it and 88.2% (n = 142) would take a pill if it was covered by their insurance.

### The impact of surgery on patients with VHL-associated tumors: an international patient survey… [^1128mg8E]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods: An international, cross-sectional survey comprising patients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany was conducted. Patients were recruited via the VHL Alliance; data were collected between Dec 2021 and May 2022. For inclusion, patients must have renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and/or central nervous system hemangioblastoma. Data collected included demographics, impact of most recent surgery on aspects of condition, tx goals, and patient preference in treatment. Patients were presented two scenarios "watch and wait" and potentially need surgery, or "take a once-daily pill" to delay a potential surgery. Results: 220 patients in the US, CA, the UK, FR, and DE completed the study. 146 patients reported RCC, n = 122 reported pNET, and n = 190 reported CNS-Hb.
47. 3% of patients selected reduce the number of surgeries as a top tx goal,
46. 4% selected being able to go about life as usual, 36. 8% delay the need for surgery, and
33. 2% improved quality of life. 73% of patients indicated they would prefer to take a pill which would possibly delay the time until surgery, rather than watch and wait to see if the tumor would grow. Conclusions: Surgery negatively impacts the lives of patients, leading to a worsening in their fatigue, mental health, and ability to go about daily life. Almost half of patients would like a treatment that reduces the number of surgeries, and over a third would like a treatment that delays the need for surgery. Nearly three quarters of patients would prefer to take a pill that might delay the need for surgery.

Tx options that reduce the need for surgery would benefit this patient group.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^1125YKR2]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

von Hippel-Lindau disease is a heritable multisystem cancer syndrome that is associated with a germline mutation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. This disorder is not rare (about one in 36000 livebirths) and is inherited as a highly penetrant autosomal dominant trait (ie, with a high individual risk of disease). Affected individuals are at risk of developing various benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, and reproductive adnexal organs. Because of the complexities associated with management of the various types of tumours in this disease, treatment is multidisciplinary. We present an overview of the clinical aspects, management, and treatment options for von Hippel-Lindau disease.

### Can AI-generated clinical vignettes in Japanese Be used medically and linguistically? [^112SUaTf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

By specifying seven input prompts, 202 clinical vignettes were created for common diseases and conditions in primary care. Of these, 118 (58.4%) were judged by all three physicians to have high medical accuracy. When including those deemed "partly insufficient and in need of modifications", the total usable clinical vignettes amounted to 196 (97%). However, critical issues were also extracted, such as nonexistent disease names and inappropriate treatment. Furthermore, 142 (70%) were judged to have high Japanese-language accuracy. It is clear that GPT can create highly accurate Japanese-language clinical vignettes of up to 700 characters if revised by Japanese physicians.

Creating clinical vignettes conventionally is an effort-intensive process because it requires physicians to consult numerous reference books to compile all the necessary clinical information. Furthermore, despite the use of various references, vignettes, being a variant of the case study method, tend to reflect the personal experiences of their creators. Vignettes generated by the AI are biased because they are based on human-generated information. Given this, to control for bias, we input sample vignettes to the AI and had it create vignettes of typical cases. Therefore, vignettes generated by AI could be standard and representative, potentially making them suitable for novice learners. Additionally, GPT is capable of generating vignettes in a short amount of time. Clinical vignettes have been proven to be practical in the past, and medical education using clinical vignettes created by the GPT could open up new possibilities for lifelong education, not just for students.

### Imaging features of Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^112WfVsM]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited multisystem disorder characterized by development of a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of the disease is broad and includes retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cysts and tumors, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cystadenomas. The most common causes of death in VHL disease patients are renal cell carcinoma and neurologic complications from cerebellar hemangioblastomas. The various manifestations can be demonstrated with different imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine. Although genetic testing is available, the manifestations of the syndrome are protean; therefore, imaging plays a key role in identification of abnormalities and subsequent follow-up of lesions. It is also used for screening of asymptomatic gene carriers and their long-term surveillance. Screening is important because the lesions in VHL disease are treatable; thus, early detection allows use of more conservative therapy and may enhance the patient's length and quality of life. A multidisciplinary team approach is important in screening for VHL disease.

### "Incidentally" discovered von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^115qWzFT]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased accessibility to hereditary cancer genetic testing has the potential for surveillance, early detection, and improved clinical outcomes. However, this comes with an increased chance of incidental findings for which there was a low pretest probability, leaving the clinician to decide on a plan of surveillance.

Here, we describe 6 patients (Table 1) referred to us at a single institution (Familial Renal Cell Carcinoma & VHL Disease Program and Hemangioblastoma Center, at Mass General Cancer Center). Typically, at the time of referral to our centers, most patients with VHL would have been found to have a characteristic VHL lesion and/or a strong family history suggestive of VHL that prompted the referral. In the below cases, we describe a new clinical entity we call "Incidental Von Hippel Lindau Disease" in 6 otherwise healthy patients who pursued genetic screening with low a priori risk for VHL (5 individuals pursuing testing for hereditary breast cancer risk and 1 to determine ancestry). All 6 patients were found to carry incidental germline pathogenic variants in the VHL gene (Figure 1).

The impetus for testing came after the mother and maternal aunt of patient 1 underwent genetic testing for early-onset breast cancer and tested positive for the aforementioned VHL pathogenic variant.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^115Brxcu]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited tumour predisposition syndrome and a paradigm for the importance of early diagnosis and surveillance. However, there is limited information on the "real world" management of VHL disease.

Methods

A national audit of VHL disease in the United Kingdom.

Results

VHL disease was managed mostly via specialist clinics coordinated through regional clinical genetics services (but frequently involving additional specialties). Over the study period, 19 genetic centres saw 842 individuals (393 males, 449 females) with a clinical and/or molecular diagnosis of VHL disease and 74 individuals (35 male, 39 female) with a prior risk of 50% (affected parent). All centres offered retinal, central nervous system and abdominal surveillance to affected individuals and at-risk relatives though surveillance details differed between centres (but complied with international recommendations). Renal lesions detected on the first surveillance scan were, on average, larger than those detected during subsequent scans and the larger the diameter at detection the greater the likelihood of early intervention.

Conclusions

In a state-funded health care system individuals with a rare inherited cancer predisposition syndrome are generally able to access appropriate surveillance and patient management is improved compared to historical data. The "real world" data from this study will inform the future development of VHL management protocols.

Methods

Audit details

Twenty-two regional genetics centres were contacted and asked to complete a standardised questionnaire (see Supplementary material) to collect data on relevant individuals who have been under follow-up for all or part of the period 2012–2017. Individuals were included in the audit if (a) they had a clinical and/or molecular diagnosis of VHL disease or (b) they were at 50% risk of inheriting VHL disease and had not undergone predictive genetic testing. A clinical diagnosis of VHL is defined according to the criteria specified in Genereviews:): 1. A simplex case (i.e. an individual with no known family history of VHL syndrome) presenting with two or more characteristic lesions (two or more haemangioblastomas of the retina, spine, or brain or a single haemangioblastoma in association with a visceral manifestation (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, adrenal or extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma, endolymphatic sac tumour (ELST), or neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas (pNET)) and 2. an individual with a positive family history of VHL disease in whom one or more of the following syndrome manifestations was present: retinal haemangioblastoma, spinal or cerebellar haemangioblastoma, adrenal or extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, multiple renal and pancreatic cysts). Patient identifiable data was not collected.

The audit was carried out against screening guidelines published Maher et al. These screening guidelines were selected because (a) they had been published and widely read several years before the study period and (b) they were from a European group and would more closely reflect medical practice in the UK than recommendations from USA groups.

Screen for retinal angioma

Annual ophthalmic examinations (direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy), beginning in infancy or early childhood.

Screen for CNS haemangioblastoma

MRI scans of the head for every 12–36 months, beginning in adolescence.

Screen for renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic tumours

MRI (or ultrasound) examinations of the abdomen every 12 months, beginning from the age of 16 years.

Screen for phaeochromocytoma

Annual blood pressure monitoring and 24-h urine studies for catecholamine metabolites. More intense surveillance (e.g. annual measurement of plasma normetanephrine levels, adrenal imaging, beginning from the age of 8 years should be considered in families at high-risk for phaeochromocytoma).

Statistical analysis

t -testing and χ² analysis were performed as appropriate. Statistical significance was designated as 5%.

### The incidence of consecutive manifestations in Von Hippel-Lindau disease [^117BoscW]. Familial Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The way VHL disease progression is defined either growth of existing lesions or development of new manifestations, may be important in acquiring a better understanding of the natural course of the disease. The aim of this study is to gain insight into disease progression in VHL patients by focusing on organ-specific serial VHL-related manifestations. We evaluated the number of subsequent organ manifestations diagnosed during life and analyzed whether the increase of new manifestation is linear according to the Poisson model, in accordance with Knudson's "two-hit" hypothesis. If new subsequent VHL-related manifestations arise linearly according to the Poisson model, these new lesions should occur with a fixed mean interval per organ system during life in all VHL patients.

### Evaluation of tumour surveillance protocols and outcomes in Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a national health service [^113duZMJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

VHL disease provides an exemplar of an inherited cancer syndrome for which surveillance programmes have reduced morbidity and mortality through earlier diagnosis. However, worldwide there is little information available on access to appropriate surveillance outside of centres with a research interest in VHL disease. We assessed the screening protocols for all the centres against that specified in a review written by an international (European) group of experts. The majority of centres audited met the selected audit standard for surveillance, but in a few centres retinal and abdominal imaging commenced later than was recommended, and not all centres offered regular ongoing brain and/or spinal cord imaging (as specified in the recommended protocol). The published surveillance programme that we selected for assessing current care made broad recommendations that would be applicable to a range of health care systems (e.g. that all patients should be offered annual abdominal imaging but the modality of imaging was not defined). It is generally agreed that MRI is superior to ultrasonography in detecting small renal masses (though the latter is operator dependent) and that annual CT scanning should be avoided because of radiation load. We found that most, but not all centres, were offering MRI alone or alternating with ultrasonography, rather than ultrasonography alone for abdominal surveillance. Though it was not possible to make a direct comparison of MRI and USS for detecting small renal tumours, we note that our data suggested that renal masses are detected earlier when MRI is used for surveillance (particularly when lesions are not detected on the first scan) (see Fig. 1a, b)). Furthermore, we found that the smaller the renal mass at detection the less likely very early or early intervention (within 12 months and within 12–36 months respectively) would be required (Fig. 2). We note a recent recommendation that the frequency of MRI abdominal surveillance might be reduced to biannually but, in the "real world" series reported here, there were instances of renal lesions being diagnosed by MRI at ≥ 3 cm (despite this not being the first scan). The format of the audit does not allow us to say what the reasons for this might be (e.g. it could be that the interval between scans was longer than the intended through compliance or organisational issues) but this finding suggests that any move to lengthen screening intervals at a national level would need to be carefully monitored as, outside of well-resourced specialist centres, such a change could increase the risk of delayed diagnosis of RCC and potentially also for PNETs.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^1154YKnQ]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Hereditary and familial RCC — proportion, syndromes, and management guidance are provided: Family history is associated with an increased risk of RCC and a number of familial RCC syndromes are now well-established, accounting for approximately 4–6% of cases of RCC overall; these syndromes include von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC), Birt Hogg-Dube (BHD), hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC), succinate dehydrogenase deficiency RCC, tuberous sclerosis, BAP-1 tumor predisposition syndrome, and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (Cowden syndrome); RCC in these syndromes tends to be earlier in onset and multifocal and management should prioritize nephron-sparing approaches, including tumor enucleation when feasible to optimize preservation of parenchymal mass; for most of these syndromes, tumors can be observed if less than 3 cm as the risk of metastases remains low in this setting; HLRCC and succinate dehydrogenase deficiency RCC are the exception as tumors in these syndromes are often very aggressive and a proactive approach to evaluation and management should be pursued; genetic counseling should also be recommended for patients suspected of having familial RCC.

### The 'other' big complication: how chronic kidney disease impacts on cancer risks and outcomes [^115VN9qi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic conditions

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare genetic condition with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, characterized by mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene. This leads to abnormal tumour and cyst growth that may be benign and/or malignant, and, in particular, increases the risk of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Resection of (recurrent) renal cell carcinoma in VHL disease often leads to progressive CKD and/or end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy.

Tuberous sclerosis is another rare, autosomal dominant condition caused by inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumour suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. Renal angiomyolipomata develop in the majority of patients with tuberous sclerosis. A smaller proportion of patients will develop large numbers of renal cysts and, more rarely, renal cell carcinoma. Ultimately, any of these abnormal growths can lead to kidney failure.

Clonal haematopoiesis is an age-related phenomenon characterized by somatic mutations in haematopoietic stem cells leading to clonal expansion of mutant leucocytes. People with evidence of clonal haematopoiesis are at substantially increased risk of haematologic cancer (along with cardiovascular disease and premature death). More recently, myeloid clonal haematopoiesis has been shown to be causally associated with development of CKD (defined by eGFRcys) and increases the risk of adverse outcomes (cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and myeloid cancers) in people with CKD.

Acute kidney injury, which causes CKD and is more common in pre-existing CKD, can promote the development of papillary renal cell carcinoma by stimulating DNA damage and repair processes, triggering renal progenitor cell proliferation and aberrant mitosis, and thus driving tumorigenesis.

Minimization of bias

The following steps were taken towards minimizing bias: where applicable, neutral phrasing of questions was used to avoid biasing responses. In addition, response options were exhaustive, including "other" and "don't know" response options, to avoid respondents having to enter false information in order to progress through the survey. Furthermore, recruitment of a relatively large patient sample with minimal inclusion criteria from a recognized VHL patient support association ensured a diverse representation of perspectives and experiences.

Statistical analysis

All the analyses were descriptive, and no formal hypothesis was tested.

### Can AI-generated clinical vignettes in Japanese Be used medically and linguistically? [^115bXWre]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the vignettes' Japanese-language accuracy, there were instances of grammatical mistakes and unnatural expressions. One reason for this is that the GPT is trained on an English database; hence, translations into other languages, including Japanese, have limitations. Moreover, Japanese belongs to a different language family tree than European languages, such as English, which might pose an affinity issue for English-based databases. However, if a native Japanese speaker reads the output, unnatural points can be easily identified within a range that is straightforward to correct. These outputs are believed to occur because the GPT relies on publicly available information that it has learned. As GPT's learning of medical information in Japanese progresses, its accuracy is likely to improve.

As evident from the clinical vignettes created in this study, considering the utility of medical information being instantly available through generative AI, it is expected that the technology of this generative AI will be increasingly applied to medical education and healthcare in the future. Although there remain valid concerns about copyright issues and the medical accuracy of the content produced by generative AI, if these technologies are used with due consideration, their application has nearly boundless potential. In particular, within the scope of these technologies' use for medical education, it is possible for instructors to censor the output, which allows its use in providing to students to be sufficiently permissible.

In sum, this study confirms it is possible to create and validate clinical vignettes of rare diseases and atypical cases of high-frequency diseases using generative AI. Moreover, the generation of images and videos using AI is now also feasible; this allows for the possibility for creating clinical vignettes containing images of X-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electrocardiography, which could further enrich the content of AI-generated vignettes and make them more educational.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease: a clinical and scientific review [^1155gP8m]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

The autosomal dominantly inherited disorder von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene (TSG). VHL mutations predispose to the development of a variety of tumours (most commonly retinal and central nervous system haemangioblastomas, clear cell renal carcinoma and phaeochromocytomas). Here, we review the clinical and genetic features of VHL disease, briefly review the molecular pathogenesis and outline clinical management and tumour surveillance strategies.
