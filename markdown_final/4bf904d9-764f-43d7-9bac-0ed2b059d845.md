## Question

What are the limitations of KOH prep compared to fungal culture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the limitations of potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation are compared to fungal culture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental methodological differences between KOH prep and culture. Then, I should analyze sensitivity and specificity trade-offs and the direction of discordance. Next, I will examine operator dependence and artifact pitfalls. After that, I should consider species-level identification and antifungal susceptibility implications for management. Then, I need to assess time-to-result and how that affects clinical decision-making. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based use of combined testing and highlight special clinical contexts where each method has strengths and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental methodological difference, because that frames all downstream limitations. KOH preparation is a direct microscopy technique that clears keratinous or cellular debris to visualize fungal elements in situ, whereas fungal culture is growth-based, yielding viable organisms that can be identified and tested further, so by design KOH can show fungal structures regardless of viability but cannot provide isolates for speciation or susceptibility, while culture does both albeit more slowly [^111wddq7] [^114sgUJ1] [^117JLATh].

> Wait, let me verify the sensitivity and specificity pattern, since misremembering the direction of error would mislead management. In comparative data using culture as the ground truth, KOH smears demonstrated high sensitivity around 96 percent but low specificity near 59 percent, indicating a tendency toward false-positive calls when culture is negative, which likely reflects detection of nonviable organisms, colonization, or contaminants rather than true infection, as well as interpretive pitfalls on smears [^113HeQ22] [^115JkXpo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without asking why KOH overcalls. I need to check common artifacts and viability issues. KOH cannot distinguish viable from nonviable elements, colonization from invasive disease, or pathogenic organisms from environmental or sampling contaminants, and it is vulnerable to look-alikes such as textile fibers present in skin and nail preparations, which can mimic hyphae unless the microscopist is experienced, further eroding specificity in routine practice [^113HeQ22] [^117XGMew].

> I should confirm the degree of operator dependence, because that directly affects real-world performance. Labeling of KOH smears shows only moderate inter-observer agreement with a kappa near 0.45 and required adjudication in over a third of slides in one dataset, and authoritative guidance underscores that direct visualization methods, including KOH of respiratory specimens for endemic mycoses, require local expertise, reinforcing that KOH results are subjective and experience-dependent [^113HeQ22] [^111rtBM7].

> Let me think about downstream clinical management implications, especially species identification and resistance, since KOH cannot provide either. For invasive and clinically consequential infections, guidelines emphasize species-level identification and, where relevant, antifungal susceptibility testing on cultured isolates to inform therapy and surveillance, tasks that are not possible with KOH alone and increasingly necessary in the era of azole-resistant Aspergillus and non-albicans Candida with variable susceptibility profiles [^112z1b2x] [^114qACBY] [^113RpwBv] [^114wQKYD].

> Next, I should review time-to-result, because speed is the main advantage of KOH but there is a reliability trade-off. KOH can be performed at the bedside and read within minutes to an hour, which is clinically attractive, but for pathogens like Blastomyces the diagnostic yield of direct microscopy is substantially lower than culture, and culture turnaround for some molds can extend up to five weeks, creating a time-to-definitive-result lag that necessitates empiric management while awaiting species-level confirmation and susceptibility [^116L3nTz] [^111rtBM7] [^111oTQq5].

> But wait, what if I am underweighting guideline recommendations on when to rely on combinations of tests. I should double-check integrated testing guidance. Respiratory mycoses guidelines recommend using more than one diagnostic modality, including direct visualization and culture plus antigen and antibody assays as appropriate, and invasive candidiasis guidelines consistently call for obtaining and working up cultures for identification to species and, when indicated, susceptibility testing, reinforcing that KOH alone should not be used in isolation to direct definitive therapy [^114GGrew] [^112z1b2x] [^112w6uxP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied KOH generally has poor sensitivity, but I should correct that because in some contexts KOH is actually very sensitive while still limited for management decisions. For example, in infective keratitis cohorts KOH wet mount has shown very high sensitivity for fungal detection, and ophthalmology guidance emphasizes early scraping for microscopy and culture, yet even here KOH cannot speciate or inform resistance and must be complemented by culture or other methods for full pathogen characterization and targeted therapy [^1171y15a] [^111UTRq4] [^113SNr9a].

> I need to ensure I tie these limitations to concrete prescribing decisions, because payers and labels sometimes require confirmation beyond clinical impression. For dermatophyte onychomycosis and tinea, regulatory labeling and primary care guidance recommend obtaining laboratory confirmation with KOH, culture, or histology before initiating systemic antifungals, and even define mycological cure using both culture and KOH, underscoring that KOH alone is insufficient as a stand-alone arbiter of cure or as the only pre-treatment confirmation in many scenarios [^115EPLK3] [^115fRZtC] [^11785pbJ].

> Stepping back, the core limitations of KOH versus culture are now clear: KOH is fast but subjective, prone to artifacts, unable to distinguish viability or colonization from infection, and incapable of species identification or susceptibility testing, while culture is slower but yields viable organisms for species-level workup and resistance testing that directly inform therapy and stewardship; therefore, best practice is to use KOH as an initial screening adjunct and pair it with culture and, when indicated, antigen or molecular assays to optimize diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment decisions [^111rtBM7] [^112z1b2x] [^114qACBY].

KOH prep is **rapid and inexpensive** [^114tZrfi] but has key limitations versus culture: it **cannot provide species-level identification** [^114wQKYD] or antifungal susceptibility [^117JLATh], and its accuracy is **operator-dependent** [^113HeQ22], with false positives from artifacts [^117XGMew] and false negatives from low organism burden or prior therapy [^111rtBM7]. It is also **less sensitive than culture** for many pathogens [^116L3nTz] and **cannot detect mixed infections** [^115yr5Je], making it unsuitable for definitive diagnosis or guiding targeted therapy [^112z1b2x]. Culture, although slower [^116L3nTz], enables species identification [^114wQKYD], susceptibility testing [^117JLATh], and detection of mixed infections [^115yr5Je], supporting precise treatment decisions [^112z1b2x].

---

### Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: KOH prep has moderate sensitivity and specificity [^1146mKHQ], with false negatives from low organism burden or prior antifungal use [^111rtBM7], and false positives from artifacts (e.g. fibers, debris) [^117XGMew].

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy depends on operator skill and experience [^113HeQ22], causing variability and potential misinterpretation.

- **Comparison with culture**: Culture is more sensitive for many pathogens [^111rtBM7], especially in low-burden or mixed infections [^115yr5Je].

---

### Species identification and antifungal susceptibility

- **Species identification**: KOH cannot provide species-level identification, limiting its utility for targeted therapy [^114wQKYD].

- **Antifungal susceptibility**: KOH does not allow susceptibility testing, so it cannot guide therapy or detect resistance [^117JLATh].

- **Culture advantage**: Culture enables species identification [^114wQKYD] and susceptibility testing [^112z1b2x], supporting precise therapy and resistance detection [^113RpwBv].

---

### Detection of mixed infections

Mixed infections are **not reliably identified by KOH** [^115yr5Je], leading to incomplete diagnosis and suboptimal therapy. In contrast, culture can **detect mixed infections** [^112Svy72], enabling comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate therapy.

---

### Turnaround time and clinical decision-making

- **Rapid results**: KOH provides rapid results (minutes to hours), aiding early clinical decisions [^114tZrfi].

- **Delayed results**: Culture requires days to weeks, potentially delaying definitive diagnosis and therapy [^116L3nTz].

- **Clinical implications**: KOH's speed supports early empiric therapy, but its limitations mean culture is needed for definitive diagnosis [^112z1b2x] and targeted therapy.

---

### Practical limitations and clinical scenarios

KOH is **useful for rapid screening of superficial infections** (e.g. dermatophytes) [^11785pbJ], but culture is needed for definitive diagnosis and species identification [^112z1b2x]. It is **inadequate for invasive infections** [^114JgPsT], for which culture and susceptibility testing [^117JLATh] are essential for management. In resource-limited settings, KOH is valuable for initial assessment, but its limitations necessitate confirmatory testing when possible.

---

### Summary of limitations

| **Limitation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Sensitivity and specificity | - Moderate accuracy <br/> - False positives/negatives common [^1146mKHQ] [^113HeQ22] [^111rtBM7] |
| Operator dependence | Accuracy varies with operator skill [^113HeQ22] |
| Species identification | Cannot provide species-level identification [^114wQKYD] |
| Antifungal susceptibility | Cannot guide therapy or detect resistance [^117JLATh] |
| Mixed infections | Cannot reliably detect mixed infections [^115yr5Je] |
| Definitive diagnosis | Not suitable for definitive diagnosis or targeted therapy [^112z1b2x] |

---

KOH prep is **rapid and inexpensive** [^114tZrfi] but limited by moderate accuracy, operator dependence, and inability to provide species identification or susceptibility testing; culture, though slower [^116L3nTz], **enables definitive diagnosis** [^112z1b2x], species identification, susceptibility testing, and detection of mixed infections [^115yr5Je], supporting targeted therapy.

### Microscopically differentiating dermatophytes from sock fibers [^117XGMew]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are responsible for a number of superficial fungal infections that affect millions worldwide. During microscopic observation of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) fungal smear, various filamentous materials, such as common textile fibers from socks, can obfuscate proper discernment of dermatophytes.

- **Objective**: To differentiate dermatophytes from 9 common sock fibers.

- **Methods**: Nine different textile fiber samples were microscopically analyzed using a KOH direct smear test. Their defining structural features were compared and contrasted with those of dermatophytes.

- **Results**: Although there are several similarities, sock fibers tend to have a non-septate, uniform structure, which differentiates them from dermatophytes. Sock fibers are also significantly larger than dermatophytes and can be viewed better at lower magnifications.

- **Limitations**: There is a lack of sock samples with 100% textile fiber composition. Additionally, fibers were examined in a clean setting, without the detritus that normally accompanies dermatophytes in a clinical setting.

- **Conclusion**: While textile fibers may be present in KOH preparations, their general appearance typically differs from that of dermatophytes. An observer who is familiar with these distinctions will be able to differentiate between the two.

### Automated detection of filamentous fungal keratitis on whole slide images of potassium hydroxide smears with multiple instance learning [^113HeQ22]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Low credibility.

Comparison with traditional methods revealed that DSMIL outperformed traditional CNNs on the slide level. Convolutions in traditional CNNs are unable to detect small details in images of this scale. In addition, CNNs need to scale down the image, which results in the loss of microscopic resolution crucial for accurate diagnosis. We found that the DSMIL approach results in a model with fairly high accuracy in cases where human graders are in agreement, yet its performance diminishes in situations where confidence in the ground truth is low, indicating more challenging images. Our analysis highlights both the potential and the challenges of using deep learning models for this application, particularly in terms of variability in human labeling and the intrinsic difficulties of interpreting KOH smears.

Labeling KOH smears on WSIs is inherently challenging and subject to operator-dependent variability and interpretation. The moderate agreement between labelers, with a kappa score of 0.45, and the need for adjudication in approximately 38.3% of cases underscore the difficulty in this task. Factors contributing to this challenge include potential quality loss during WSI conversion and the intrinsic difficulty of interpreting KOH smears.

The KOH smear test demonstrated high sensitivity (96.0%) but lower specificity (59.2%) when compared with fungal cultures as ground truth. This finding aligns with other studies, which also report high false positive rates due to the nongrowth of fungi in culture. This discrepancy reveals the inherent limitations of KOH smears, where the presence of fungi does not always correlate with culture results.

### Comparison of diagnostic methods in the evaluation of onychomycosis [^1146mKHQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common problem seen in clinical practice. Given the differential diagnosis of dystrophic nails, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of dermatophyte infection before initiating antifungal therapy is helpful. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and fungal culture, typically used in diagnosing these infections, often yield false-negative results. Recent reports suggest that nail plate biopsy using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (Bx/PAS) stain may be a very sensitive technique for diagnosing onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS stain, and calcofluor white (CW) stain in diagnosing onychomycosis and to determine their sensitivity and specificity.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 105 patients with suspected onychomycosis using four diagnostic methods: KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS, and CW stain. CW stain binds to cellulose and chitin and fluoresces when exposed to UV radiation. It is a highly sensitive and specific technique for the detection of dermatophytes. To determine the clinical usefulness and performance characteristics of each test, CW was chosen as the gold standard for statistical analysis.

- **Results**: Of the patients, 93 had at least one of the four diagnostic methods positive for the presence of organisms. The following were calculated for each test: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The sensitivities of each of the techniques were as follows: KOH 80%, Bx/PAS 92%, and culture 59%. Both KOH and Bx/PAS demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting the presence of organisms.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to fungal culture, ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining identification of Candida to the species level when treatment is being considered. This is important to guide empirical management, detect outbreaks, and for surveillance. Use algorithms incorporating clinical risk as a guide for identifying when yeast cultured from different specimen types.

### Antifungal susceptibility testing and identification [^117JLATh]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The requirement for antifungal susceptibility testing is increasing given the availability of new drugs, increasing populations of individuals at risk for fungal infection, and emerging multiresistant fungi. Rapid and accurate fungal identification remains at the forefront of laboratory efforts to guide empiric therapy. Antifungal susceptibility testing methods have greatly improved but are subject to variation in results between methods. Careful standardization, validation, and extensive training of users are essential to ensure susceptibility results are clinically useful and interpreted appropriately. Interpretive criteria for many drugs and species are still lacking, but this will continue to evolve.

### Fungal keratitis: Diagnosis, management, and recent advances [^111UTRq4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of fungal keratitis relies significantly on clinical signs for an initial assessment, but confirmation and identification of the causative organism require additional diagnostic tests, particularly microbiological laboratory tests. The potential for a combined infection should also be considered. It is crucial that microbiological tests occur at presentation and prior to the administration of medications.

- **Corneal scraping**: Corneal scraping is the first step in laboratory testing to obtain tissues for examination and culture. This procedure aids in the debulking of fungi and the debridement of the surface, facilitating medication penetration. It is typically performed with a spatula or surgical blade, though less preferably, swabs or sponge-like materials may be used. Scraping the ulcer base along its edge is advisable.

	- **Additional procedures**: If there is an endothelial plaque or deep keratitis, an anterior chamber tap may be necessary. In some cases, a corneal biopsy may also be performed. Contact lenses, their solution, topical medications used, and eye cosmetics should be cultured if indicated.

- **New laboratory techniques**: Recent evaluations of new diagnostic methods for fungal keratitis have shown promising results. For instance, using a lateral-flow device for diagnosing Aspergillus in corneal scrapes from suspected fungal keratitis patients demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy in identifying Aspergillus species from corneal scrapes and swabs.

- **Direct microscopy**: Examination of corneal smears through direct microscopy is an essential initial step in laboratory diagnosis. Various stains such as Giemsa, Gram, and others might be used for this purpose to enhance visibility and identification of fungal elements.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^115fRZtC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The following definitions were applied to the clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients enrolled in the clinical trials that form the basis for the approval of oxiconazole nitrate cream.

- **Mycological cure**: No evidence (culture and KOH preparation) of the baseline (original) pathogen in a specimen from the affected area taken at the 2-week post-treatment visit. For tinea (pityriasis) versicolor, mycological cure was limited to KOH only.

- **Treatment success**: Both a global evaluation of 90% clinical improvement and a microbiologic eradication (see above) at the 2-week post-treatment visit.

- **Tinea pedis**: There are no head-to-head comparison trials of the oxiconazole nitrate cream and lotion formulations in the treatment of tinea pedis.

The two pivotal trials for the oxiconazole nitrate cream formulation involved 281 evaluable patients (total from both trials) with clinically and microbiologically established tinea pedis. The combined results of these two clinical trials at the 2-week post-treatment follow-up visit are shown in the following:

All the improvement and cure rates of the b.i.d.- and q.d.-treated groups did not differ significantly (95% confidence interval) from each other but were statistically (95% confidence interval) superior to the vehicle-treated group.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^1122BzNa]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

This study investigated the relationship between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care, and further examined whether this relationship varies by gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Methods**: The data in this study were obtained from the sixth Health Service of Shandong Province, China. In total, 8,358 older adults aged 60 years or older who received informal care were included in the analysis. Binary logistic regression models were conducted to explore the association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination and examine the differences between gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Results**: The prevalence of limitations in ADL and physical examination utilization rate among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong Province were 14.12% and 72.31%, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ADL limitations were negatively correlated with the utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87, P < 0.001), with gender and rural-urban differences. The association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination was statistically significant in older women receiving informal care (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80, P < 0.001). Among urban older adults receiving informal care, those with ADL limitations had lower utilization of physical examination services than participants without ADL limitations (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74, P < 0.001).

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111rtBM7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

None of the widely available diagnostic approaches for the diagnosis of blastomycosis exhibit consistently high performance characteristics to recommend using a single test in isolation from other approaches. For instance, direct visualization of blastomycosis organisms, though specific and timely, exhibits suboptimal sensitivity and yield. Culture of respiratory secretions, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), has reasonably high sensitivity; yet, the diagnosis may be delayed for up to five weeks with this approach. Antigen testing, particularly as applied to urine, can be a useful diagnostic adjunct with good sensitivity. However, antigen assays do exhibit significant cross-reactivity to other endemic mycoses. Serum antibody testing has been variably reported to exhibit low to moderate sensitivity, but again it carries the risk of cross-reactivity with other fungal infections. PCR approaches are emerging but are not yet widely available in clinical settings and have not been analyzed in large clinical studies. The clinician confronted with a case of possible blastomycosis should consider using a variety of assays to optimize the overall diagnostic yield and to prevent overdiagnosis of blastomycosis occurring through cross-reactivity of assays with other fungi, particularly histoplasmosis.

- **Implementation and limitations**: Direct visualization of blastomycosis organisms, such as by KOH-treated preparation of respiratory secretions and BAL, can rapidly and specifically confirm the diagnosis, but it requires local expertise. Culture can also be performed at local or regional referral laboratories.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern® [^1144NmNW]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bacterial keratitis, more specifically concerning history and physical examination, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend performing a comprehensive physical examination in patients with suspected bacterial keratitis. This includes:

- **Measurement of visual acuity**: To document the baseline visual acuity and ensure that it is consistent with the anterior segment examination.

- **External examination**: Including the general appearance of the patient, such as skin conditions, facial examination, globe position, eyelids and eyelid closure, conjunctiva, and nasolacrimal apparatus. Corneal sensation testing should also be conducted if appropriate.

- **Slit-lamp biomicroscopy**: To examine eyelid margins, conjunctiva, sclera, and cornea.

- **Anterior chamber assessment**: For evaluating depth and the presence of inflammation, including cell and flare, hypopyon, fibrin, and hyphema.

- **Anterior vitreous assessment**: To check for the presence of inflammation.

- **Contralateral eye assessment**: To identify clues to etiology as well as possible similar underlying pathology.

### Clinical characteristics of people with cystic fibrosis and frequent fungal infection [^116hwAAQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Low credibility.

Defining infection status, we initially compared patients with no fungal positive cultures to those with rare fungus (one positive) and intermittent fungi (≥ 2 positive but < 50% positive). However, given the limited group sample sizes, we chose to dichotomize fungal exposure to align with previously published literature and to provide greater power for group comparisons. Results from cultures over the two-year baseline period were used to categorize individuals as either having rare fungus, defined as ≤ 1 positive fungal culture in the baseline period with no positive fungal cultures recorded before baseline, or frequent fungi, defined as having two or more positive fungal cultures in the baseline period. These definitions were adapted from previously published fungal and chronic bacterial infection studies in cystic fibrosis.

Given that we defined fungal exposure during the baseline period, individuals could transition groups during the follow-up period (e.g. those classified as rare could later meet criteria for frequent fungal infection). Participants were considered rare during follow-up if they had one positive culture and considered frequent if they met the criteria (two positive cultures) in any year of follow-up. Chronic P. aeruginosa status was defined by a modified Leeds criteria of > 50% positive cultures for P. aeruginosa over at least one 12-month period. Patients were defined as chronic at baseline if they met these criteria for at least one 12-month period in the baseline study period, and similarly defined during the follow-up.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116L3nTz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Visualization of typical blastomycosis organisms in freshly prepared respiratory secretions or in histopathology can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of infection. The diagnostic yield of visualized organisms on KOH preparations of respiratory secretions, including BAL, was reported as 36% when a single sample was studied and 46% in confirmed cases with multiple specimens. The diagnostic yield of culture was up to 86% across multiple specimens from the same patient and 75% from a single specimen. However, culture positivity could take up to 5 weeks for completion.

- **Recommendations**: In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to blastomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum, BAL, or other biopsy material, urine antigen testing, and serum antibody testing. The evidence cannot support a single best test as being sensitive enough to be ordered in isolation of other testing. The approach should be tailored based on the severity of illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Technical remark**: Although microscopic visualization and culture to identify blastomycosis organisms are quite specific, they lack sensitivity. Hence, the addition of serum antibody testing and urine antigen testing increases the overall diagnostic yield.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes are spread by direct contact from other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites.

Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Diagnosis occasionally requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination.

- **Therapies**: Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with the newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate.

- **Diagnosis of onychomycosis**: The diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Has antifungal susceptibility testing come of age [^11724y1U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The in vitro susceptibility of an infecting organism to the antimicrobial agent chosen for therapy is a key factor influencing the success of infection treatment. To understand the value of antifungal susceptibility testing, it is beneficial to consider the predictive utility of antibacterial susceptibility testing. After more than 30 years of research, in vitro susceptibility has been demonstrated to predict bacterial infection response with a high degree of accuracy, summarized by the "90–60 rule": infections due to susceptible isolates respond to therapy approximately 90% of the time, whereas infections due to resistant isolates respond about 60% of the time.

Standardized susceptibility testing for selected organism-drug combinations, particularly Candida species and azole antifungal agents, has been shown to have similar predictive utility. Consequently, antifungal susceptibility testing is now increasingly and aptly used as a routine adjunct to the treatment of fungal infections.

### Molecular diagnostics in medical mycology [^115icmVr]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

For any diagnostic assay to be successful in the clinical laboratory, ease of use and turnaround time are crucial. Assays that can be completed rapidly with minimal sample preparation are desirable. For fungal infections in particular, the ability to output quantitative values that help determine fungal load can provide clinicians with useful information for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. Similarly, an assay should have a wide analytical range that allows it to be accurate with either minute or large numbers of cells, especially for infected tissue. Unfortunately, as with all microorganisms, antifungal resistance is a growing problem, resulting in an increasing need for assays that can yield an identification and simultaneously determine if drug resistance is present.

Different platforms will have different specimen types that can be used. Whole-cell assays may be problematic due to the complex morphology of fungi (e.g. single-celled yeasts, filamentous hyphae, or both - dimorphism). While yeast cells are usually handled by any instrument that uses whole-cell inputs, analysis of molds may be difficult or impossible due to physical problems posed by hyphae, which can clog channels or tubes, clump, or be unevenly distributed in liquid. Platforms that work on dead or lysed cells are especially valuable due to the increasing need to perform diagnostic tests on fixed specimens. Unfortunately, formalin, typically used in the fixation process, can fragment and crosslink DNA and proteins, inhibiting downstream analyses.

### Laboratory-based epidemiological study of superficial fungal infections [^115JkXpo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Dermatophytosis continues to be a worldwide problem, constituting a large bulk of cases attending dermatology outpatient departments in tropical countries. Variable climatic conditions and multiple etiological agents, whose individual prevalence varies with time, prompted an attempt to define the pattern and etiologic prevalence in our locality and compare them with earlier studies from different centers. Of consenting patients clinically diagnosed to have superficial fungal infections, 1975 were investigated in the laboratory. All the specimens collected from patient skin, hair, or nails were subjected to direct microscopy examination in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and fungal culture. A confirmed diagnosis was made only if the specimen was KOH and/or culture positive. The male-to-female ratio was 1.65:1. Tinea corporis (21.4%), onychomycoses (14.7%), and tinea capitis (6.2%) were the most common laboratory-confirmed infections. Only 909 patients (47%) out of 1035 clinically suspected patients had evidence of fungal infection by either microscopy and/or culture. Of these 909 patients, 787 (86.5%) were both KOH and culture positive, 25 (2.7%) were KOH negative and culture positive, while 97 (10.6%) were KOH positive but culture negative. In 1051 patients (53%), no evidence of fungal infection was seen. Trichophyton rubrum was the most commonly isolated dermatophyte (55.2%), followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes (19.6%) and Trichophyton tonsurans (2.9%). Candida sp. accounted for 16% of all isolates. Non-dermatophyte molds (NDM) were isolated only in patients with onychomycosis.

### Potassium hydroxide: An alternative reagent to perform the modified Apt test [^112Sd12o]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We tested the performance of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in the modified Apt test under different experimental conditions, using sodium hydroxide as a positive control.

### Touch preparation for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated aspergillosis [^116PHLh5]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A variety of histologic stains can aid in identifying fungal organisms on direct microscopy of touch preparations. Many stains target chitin in fungal cell walls, although there are differences in the drying time and specificity of components stained. KOH may be used to help clear the specimen of debris, and other stains can be added after application of KOH.

Chlorazol Black E, used in this case, can be applied directly to the touch preparation tissue smear with staining sufficient to distinguish fungal elements in as little as 5 minutes. A staining procedure designed for blood smears, marketed as Quik-Dip (Mercedes Medical, Sarasota, FL), was used on a touch preparation to diagnose cutaneous cryptococcal infection. Parker blue ink, as a component of Swartz Lamkins fungal stain, has been reported in touch preparations for cutaneous zygomycosis. Grocott and Gomori methenamine silver stains, hematoxylin-eosin stain, and periodic acid-Schiff with diastase are all routinely used in processed tissue samples and are necessary for confirmation of any presumptive diagnosis based on touch preparation.

A simple technique using a spatula and tape has also been described for quickly mounting intact fungal organisms from a tube culture onto a slide for microscopic examination.

### Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests for toenail onychomycosis: a repeated-measure, single-blinded, cross-sectional evaluation of 7 diagnostic tests [^114XS3ew]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Our purpose was to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of the most commonly used diagnostic tests for onychomycosis: potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH), interpreted both by a dermatologist (KOH-CLINIC) and a laboratory technician (KOH-LAB); KOH with dimethyl sulfoxide (KOH-DMSO) and with chlorazol black E (KOH-CBE), interpreted by a dermatologist; culture using dermatophyte test medium; culture with Mycobiotic and Inhibitory Mold Agar (Cx); and histopathologic analysis using periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS).

This was a repeated-measure, blinded, cross-sectional study conducted at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Inclusion criteria included: at least one toenail with 25% or more clinical disease, defined as subungual debris with onycholysis and/or onychauxis. Exclusion criteria included other nail dystrophies, use of oral antifungal medication for 2 months or longer within the past year, or topical ciclopirox lacquer within 6 weeks of enrollment. The main outcome measure was the cost-effectiveness (Medicare and non-Medicare costs) of 7 diagnostic tests. Sensitivity (at least 3 positive tests) was the unit of effectiveness.

Two hundred four participants were enrolled; their average age was 69.5 years, and 95.5% were male. PAS was the most sensitive test (98.8%); it was statistically significantly more sensitive than all other diagnostic tests except KOH-CBE (94.3%). Dermatophyte test medium was the least sensitive test (57.3%). KOH-CBE was statistically significantly more cost-effective than any other test.

### Diagnosis and treatment outcome of mycotic keratitis at a tertiary eye care center in eastern India [^112Svy72]. BMC Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Mycotic keratitis is an important cause of corneal blindness worldwide, including in India. Geographical location and climate are known to influence the profile of fungal diseases. While there are several reports on mycotic keratitis from southern India, comprehensive clinico-microbiological reports from eastern India are few. The reported prevalence of mycotic keratitis is 36.7% in southern India, 36.3% in western India, 25.6% in north-eastern India, and 7.3% in northern India. This study reports the epidemiological characteristics, microbiological diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of mycotic keratitis at a tertiary eye care center in eastern India.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of medical and microbiology records was conducted for all patients with laboratory-proven fungal keratitis.

- **Results**: Between July 2006 and December 2009, 997 patients were clinically diagnosed with microbial keratitis. No organisms were found in 25.4% (253/997) of corneal samples; 23.4% (233/997) were bacterial, 26.4% (264/997) were fungal (with 45 cases mixed with bacteria), 1.4% (14/997) were Acanthamoeba with or without bacteria, and 23.4% (233/997) were microsporidial with or without bacteria. Fungus was cultured in 81.4% (215/264) of samples, while 49 corneal scrapings were positive for fungal elements only in direct microscopy. A clinical diagnosis of fungal keratitis was made in 70.5% (186/264) of cases. Microscopic detection of fungal elements was achieved using 10% potassium hydroxide with 0.1% calcofluor white stain in 94.8% (238/251) of cases. Aspergillus species were identified in 27.9% (60/215) of cultures.

### Recent developments in culture-independent fungal diagnostics [^113HWJ1F]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Culture-independent diagnostics for fungi potentially offer increased sensitivity and more rapid results relative to culture. Recent developments include new platforms for fungal cell wall antigen detection, commercially available targeted nucleic acid amplification tests, and the use of sequencing-based technologies for the detection and identification of a broad range of fungal pathogens. Although these tests are not without limitations, many more commercially available platforms now exist, and efforts to increase the standardization of laboratory-developed tests are ongoing. Additionally, implementation studies are beginning to delineate the optimal use cases for molecular diagnostics across a range of fungal diseases and at-risk populations.

### Hints to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome: Three-step bedside oculomotor examination more sensitive than early MRI diffusion-weighted imaging [^115Chm3Y]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

The HINTS (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is a clinical tool used in the evaluation of patients presenting with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). AVS is characterized by a sudden onset of prolonged, continuous vertigo, unsteady gait, nausea or vomiting, nystagmus, and head-motion intolerance. The HINTS examination is instrumental in differentiating between a central cause of AVS, such as a stroke, and a peripheral cause, such as vestibular neuritis.

The HINTS examination consists of three key components: the head impulse test, observation for nystagmus, and the test of skew. A "central" pattern on the HINTS examination (normal head impulse test, direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation) is highly suggestive of a stroke, while a "peripheral" pattern (abnormal head impulse test, horizontal or horizontal-torsional nystagmus, and no skew deviation) suggests a peripheral cause.

The HINTS examination is particularly valuable in the emergency department setting, where rapid differentiation between central and peripheral causes of AVS is crucial. It has been shown to be more sensitive than early MRI in detecting strokes in patients with AVS.

In evaluating patients with acute vestibular syndrome to distinguish between a potential stroke and a benign cause such as vestibular neuritis, the HINTS examination relies on three clinical tests to interpret the results systematically.

### Validation and clinical application of molecular methods for the identification of molds in tissue [^112sjzPQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections due to less-common molds are an increasing problem, and accurate diagnosis is difficult.

- **Methods**: We used our previously established molecular method, which allows species identification of molds in histological tissue sections, to test sequential specimens from 56 patients with invasive fungal infections who were treated at our institution from 1982 to 2000.

- **Results**: The validity of the method was demonstrated with the establishment of a molecular diagnosis in 52 cases (93%). Confirmation of the causative organism was made in all cases in which a mold had been cultured from the tissue specimen. Less-common molds were identified in 7% of cases and appear to be an increasing problem.

- **Conclusions**: Our previously established method has proven to be of value in determining the incidence of invasive infection caused by less-common molds. Institutions should continue pursuing the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections by means of tissue culture and microbiologic analysis.

### Utility of touch preparation for rapid diagnosis of cutaneous mucormycosis [^113DzMLF]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Touch preparations have been described extensively in the literature as a diagnostic tool for solid and hematologic malignancies. The usefulness of touch preparation for rapid diagnosis of invasive cutaneous infections has been reported in only six cases. However, three of these reports, including the present case, were from residents trained at the same hospital program in this simple technique with reproducible success. Multiple stains can highlight fungal organisms, including but not limited to potassium hydroxide, periodic acid–Schiff, Gomori methenamine silver, and even Gram stain.

In our case, the use of a touch preparation with Swartz Lamkins (Delasco), which contains potassium hydroxide, allowed for identification of fungal organisms even before tissue culture and pathology results were available, permitting early intervention. Demonstration of the organism in a tissue biopsy specimen and confirmation of the species by culture still remain the gold standard for diagnosis of opportunistic infection. Dermatologists should become familiar with touch preparation because it is easy to perform and may allow for the rapid bedside diagnosis of mycotic and protozoan infections in acutely ill immunocompromised patients.

### Validation of a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for tinea unguium diagnosis [^11455Qp2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Tinea unguium is a common nail disease caused by dermatophytes. Although direct potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy and fungal culture are considered the gold standard for diagnosing this disease, their accuracy is insufficient. A lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) kit, using a monoclonal antibody against Trichophyton rubrum, was developed, and its sensitivity was recently improved by 50% in vitro relative to its earlier version. The present study aimed to validate the clinical utility of this improved LFIA kit for diagnosing tinea unguium in comparison with direct KOH microscopy.

A similar trial was simultaneously performed using scale samples from patients with tinea pedis to determine the assay's diagnostic potential. Nail samples, approximately 2 mg in weight, were collected from 112 non-treated tinea unguium patients and 56 non-tinea unguium patients. Samples from 25 tinea pedis patients and 20 non-tinea pedis patients were also collected. The sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA kit for tinea unguium was 84.8% (95/112) (95% confidence interval, 76.8–90.9) and 83.9% (47/56) (95% CI, 71.7–92.4), respectively. The inconsistency rate was 15.5% (26/168) (95% CI, 10.4–21.9). The sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA kit for tinea pedis was 84.0% (21/25) and 100.0% (20/20), respectively.

These results suggest that for diagnosing tinea unguium, the LFIA kit is a useful supplement to, but not a replacement for, direct KOH microscopy. For definitive diagnosis of suspected cases, appropriate sampling, repeated examinations, and a combination of diagnostic techniques are recommended.

### Griseofulvin microsize [^115a8qE3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are as follows: tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on the rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures regarding hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in the treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved in addition to dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

- **Adults**: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or less extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less following a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

- **Pediatric patients (older than 2 years)**: A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate. For pediatric patients weighing from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; for pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^116ysNsL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care, and to further analyze the gender and rural-urban differences in this association. Our findings suggested that ADL limitations were associated with lower utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong, China. We also found gender and urban-rural disparities in the relationship between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination. Specifically, ADL limitations were negatively associated with the use of physical examination among older women, and a significant correlation was only found in urban areas.

The study indicated that ADL limitations were negatively associated with the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong, China. This finding was consistent with previous studies showing that ADL limitations were connected with decreased utilization of physical examination services in older adults. There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, this could be due to a shortage of qualified primary healthcare providers. Informal caregivers generally lack specialized care knowledge and skills training, and they tend to focus on healthcare for the "dysfunction" itself, ignoring the importance of using preventive health services, especially for older adults with ADL limitations. Meanwhile, due to limited human resources and heavy healthcare tasks, primary healthcare institutions lack sufficient doctors who can adequately address the needs of this population.

### Potassium hydroxide mount with cellophane adhesive tape: A method for direct diagnosis of dermatophyte skin infections [^114tZrfi]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount is a simple and rapid procedure that can be performed with minimal resources and provides results within 1–2 hours.

- **Aim**: To further optimize KOH mount using transparent cellophane tape to ascertain fungal elements, even by inexperienced personnel.

- **Methods**: A split-body study was conducted on 100 patients with tinea cruris. The conventional scrape method was performed on the right side and the cellophane tape method on the left. Microscopy was performed 1–2 hours after collection, as well as on the next morning and days 3 and 7.

- **Results**: Of the 100 samples, positive results were seen in 91 (91%) with the standard method and 94 (94%) with the cellophane tape method. Clumping of the fungi and presence of artefacts were more marked with the scrape than with the tape method.

- **Conclusion**: In view of its merits over the conventional scrape method, the cellophane tape method is a prudent alternative for the detection of superficial fungal infections.

### Microbiological diagnosis of infective keratitis: Comparative evaluation of direct microscopy and culture results [^1171y15a]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount, Gram stain, Giemsa stain, and Kinyoun's acid-fast stain in the diagnosis of infective keratitis.

A retrospective analysis of all patients with clinically diagnosed infective keratitis presenting between September 1999 and September 2002 was conducted. Corneal scrapes were obtained and subjected to direct microscopy and culture.

In the results, 3,298 eyes of 3,295 consecutive patients with infective keratitis were evaluated. Among these, 1,138 eyes (34.51%) had fungal growth alone, 1,069 (32.41%) had bacterial growth alone, 33 (1%) had Acanthamoeba growth alone, 83 (2.5%) had mixed microbial growth, and the remaining 975 (29.56%) had no growth. The sensitivity of KOH wet mount was higher: 99.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.6 to 99.6) in the detection of fungi, 100% (95% CI 90.4 to 100) in the detection of Nocardia, and 91.4% (95% CI 75.8 to 97) in the detection of Acanthamoeba. This was compared to Gram-stained smears which showed sensitivities of 89.2% (95% CI 87.3 to 90.8) for fungi, 87% (95% CI 73.0 to 94.6) for Nocardia, and 60% (95% CI 42.2 to 75.6) for Acanthamoeba. Additionally, 1,764 of 3,295 (53.54%) patients presented more than 7 days after the onset of illness, with 84.69% of the eyes having corneal ulcers larger than 2 mm in diameter. The positivity rates for KOH were significantly higher among eyes with larger ulcers (> 2 mm).

In conclusion, the KOH smear is of greater diagnostic value in detecting specific pathogens in cases of infective keratitis.

### Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis: Pictorial review [^115tYpJk]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Direct microscopy, histopathology, and fungal culture of surgical specimens form the cornerstones in the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Hyphae of Mucorales demonstrate a broad (6–25 μm), non-septate, branching (90° bifurcations) morphology and can be detected using direct microscopy or on a potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount preparation. Neutrophilic or granulomatous inflammation is the predominant finding on histopathology. Prominent necrosis and angioinvasion are common. Histopathological tissue diagnosis is still one of the most accurate and fast diagnostic modalities for mucormycosis. All Mucorales species grow rapidly on Sabouraud dextrose agar at a temperature of 25–30 °C. Recently introduced molecular assays, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques, aid in the rapid diagnosis and speciation of Mucorales from a variety of specimens.

- **High-power microscopy**: A potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount demonstrates a broad, aseptate, branching (at 90°) hypha of Mucorales.

- **Histopathological examination**: Following surgical debridement of neck tissues in two different patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining demonstrates broad, branching fungal hyphae on the background of extensive tissue necrosis. Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining relies on the oxidation of the polysaccharides within fungal cell walls, resulting in black staining of hyphae against a green counterstain.

- **Sabouraud dextrose agar**: Shows both obverse and reverse views used for the selective cultivation of fungal species.

### First report of human infection due to the fungus Triadelphia pulvinata [^113ohiQN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Triadelphia pulvinata, a soil hyphomycete, was identified as the cause of eczematoid, scaly, grey lesions on the skin of both eyelids of a 30-year-old Indian male residing in Saudi Arabia. Repeated KOH preparations of the skin scrapings revealed the presence of sclerotic, branched, septate hyphae. When cultured, skin scrapings from the lesion grew the dematiaceous fungus T. pulvinata. Treatment with topical clotrimazole cured the infection, and no recurrence was noted in a 5-year follow-up.

### Prospective comparison of microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of corneal ulcer [^113SNr9a]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

To compare polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to microbial culture for the detection and identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens in microbial keratitis. This study was a prospective cohort study involving 108 consecutive corneal ulcers that were cultured and analyzed by PCR using pan-bacterial and pan-fungal primers. The PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared to culture results using standard bioinformatics tools.

The results showed that, of the 108 samples, 56 were culture-positive (25 for bacteria and 31 for fungi), while 52 were culture-negative. After eliminating false-positive PCR products, 94 of the 108 samples were positive by PCR (37 for bacteria and 57 for fungi). Nineteen of 25 bacterial culture-positive samples were positive by PCR, and 29 of 31 samples culture-positive for fungi were positive by PCR. The majority of sequenced PCR products matched the positive culture results. Of the 52 culture-negative samples, 46 (88%) yielded pathogen deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR products, including 18 bacterial and 28 fungal, representing a variety of species, with at least three novel previously uncultured microbes.

In conclusion, PCR detects microbial DNA in the majority of bacterial and fungal corneal ulcers and identifies potentially pathogenic organisms in a high proportion of culture-negative cases. The yield and concordance with culture are higher for fungal than bacterial ulcers. However, the practical use of the technique is limited by artefactual amplification of nonpathogenic organisms. PCR may be used as an adjunct to culture to identify potential pathogens in microbial keratitis.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^113BW33S]? BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The association between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination is explored among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong, China. In Model 1, there is no statistical significance between ADL limitations and the utilization of physical examination services (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.07). However, after adjusting for control variables in Model 2, older adults with ADL limitations have lower utilization of physical examination services compared to their peers without such limitations (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87).

- **Table 2: Association between ADL limitations and physical examination among older adults with informal care**
	- **Note**: ADL = Activities of daily living; CI = Confidence interval; OR = Odds ratio

### Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is effective for analysis of ergosterol in fungal-infected nails [^114No71B]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Identification of onychomycosis is mainly based on clinical diagnosis with auxiliary diagnostic methods such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, periodic acid-Schiff staining, or fungal culture. However, each method is limited by its sensitivity and specificity.

- **Aim**: To develop a new test method using the common fungal end product, ergosterol, and investigate if it can be used as a new diagnostic tool.

- **Methods**: We collected consecutive data from 20 participants with nail problems. Following clinical diagnosis, samples were taken for KOH microscopy and for mass spectrometry (MS) to check for the presence of ergosterol.

- **Results**: Of the 20 cases collected, 7 were positive for fungal infection by MS. Four of these were already suspected to have onychomycosis, whereas one of the remaining three subjects was presumed to have a dry nail and the other two to have onycholysis. The MS test seemed to be better at detecting combinations of nail conditions. Conversely, of the five patients clinically diagnosed as having onychomycosis, four had a positive MS result, whereas the fifth had negative results on both KOH and MS. Two other participants had a positive KOH test and were also found to have positive MS results.

- **Conclusion**: Detection of the presence of ergosterol by MS seems to be a useful tool for confirming onychomycosis. However, further studies are needed to verify the sensitivity and specificity of this MS method.

### Pulmonary blastomycosis: An appraisal of diagnostic techniques [^111oTQq5]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary blastomycosis often mimics bacterial pneumonia or bronchogenic carcinoma, which may result in delayed therapy or the performance of unnecessary diagnostic procedures. This study reviews the utilization of diagnostic techniques in the workup of patients with pulmonary blastomycosis, defines their diagnostic yields, and proposes an optimal diagnostic approach for patients considered to have this condition.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of blastomycosis at a major academic medical center.

- **Results**: In 119 patients with blastomycosis, 56 (47%) had pulmonary involvement. A total of 92 specimens were obtained by noninvasive means from 35 patients: 72 sputa, 5 tracheal secretions, and 15 gastric washings. KOH smears were prepared from 22 (24%) of those specimens. The diagnostic yield of culture specimens obtained by noninvasive means was 86% per patient and 75% per single sample. The diagnostic yields from KOH smears were 46% and 36%, respectively. Flexible bronchoscopy, performed in 24 patients, yielded a diagnosis in 22 (92%). Cultures of bronchial secretions from 19 patients were positive in 100%, whereas BAL fluid cultures were positive in 67% of patients. The corresponding yields of KOH preparations were 17% (1 of 6 preparations) and 50% (3 of 6 preparations), respectively. Pathology specimens from bronchoscopic lung biopsies, bronchial brushings, and bronchoscopic needle aspiration were positive in relevant patients.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^116hpBbE]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated the relationship between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care, and further examined whether this relationship varies by gender and between urban-rural areas.

- **Methods**: The data were obtained from the sixth Health Service of Shandong Province, China. In total, 8,358 older adults aged 60 years or older who received informal care were included in the analysis. Binary logistic regression models were conducted to explore the association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination, and to examine differences between gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Results**: The prevalence of limitations in ADL and physical examination utilization rate among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong Province were 14.12% and 72.31%, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ADL limitations were negatively correlated with the utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87, P < 0.001). There were gender and rural-urban differences. The association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination was statistically significant in older women receiving informal care (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80, P < 0.001), and among urban older adults receiving informal care, those with ADL limitations had lower utilization of physical examination services than participants without ADL limitations (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74, P < 0.001).

Our study suggested that the relationship between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination services is influenced by gender and residence type among older adults receiving informal care in China.

### Unilateral nipple hyperkeratosis [^114cuZa5]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 2: What is the most accurate test for identifying a cutaneous malignancy of the breast?**
	- **A. Wedge biopsy** – Correct. Histologic evidence of Paget cells (malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells) in single or small groups in the epidermis is required to establish a diagnosis of Paget disease. Wedge biopsy is the most sensitive method to establish a definitive diagnosis of Paget disease because the epidermis can be adequately sampled and the biopsy is likely to include lactiferous ducts. Staging workup is the same for both women and men and classified based on the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Treatment options should be discussed between the patient, dermatologists, and oncologists and can range from broad cytotoxic or targeted drug therapy, radiation, or surgery.
	- **B. Potassium hydroxide scraping** – Incorrect. A scraping is typically used to identify either fungal or scabies infections. For fungal infections, following a scraping, a drop of 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide would be added and examined for hyphae, budding yeast, or both under a microscope. For scabies, mineral oil would be added and examined for mites, feces, or eggs. It would not be beneficial in identifying a malignancy.
	- **C. Punch biopsy** – Incorrect. Although a punch biopsy will include underlying stroma and possible portions of lactiferous ducts, frequently, it will fail to sample enough epidermis to make a definitive diagnosis.

### Demography, risk factors, and clinical and microbiological features of microbial keratitis at a tertiary eye hospital in Nepal [^117V2spv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Laboratory procedures involved specimen collection, inoculation, and identification of the organism through a standard protocol. Kimura's spatula was used to obtain material from the leading edge and base of the ulcer. The specimen was inoculated directly onto blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), and thioglycollate broth. Separate glass slides were used for Gram stain, Giemsa stain, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount. For suspected amoebic corneal cases, the specimen was inoculated onto non-nutrient agar overlaid with Escherichia coli.

All bacterial cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 °C. To ensure 3 to 5% carbon dioxide, incubated chocolate agar plates were placed inside a candle jar. Cultures on blood agar, chocolate agar, and broth were evaluated daily up to 72 hours and then discarded if there was no growth. Fungal cultures in SDA were incubated at 25 °C and checked for growth for up to 1 week before being discarded. Similarly, cultures on non-nutrient agar overlaid with E. coli were discarded after 1 week if there was no growth.

Microbial culture was considered significant if any of the following criteria were satisfied: 1) growth of the same organism was demonstrated on two or more media; 2) confluent growth was observed at the site of inoculation on one solid medium; 3) growth on one medium was consistent with direct microscopy findings, including appropriate staining and morphology with Gram stain; and 4) the same organism was grown from repeated scraping material. Identification of bacteria was based on microscopic morphology and staining.

### Automated detection of filamentous fungal keratitis on whole slide images of potassium hydroxide smears with multiple instance learning [^112aKeM9]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). High credibility.

We aimed to use computer vision to enable automated interpretation of KOH smear specimens. This requires obtaining microscopic photographs. However, the high magnification needed to visualize fungal filaments limits the field of view, making this challenging. Implementing a computer vision model trained to interpret standard photomicrographs would require the user to manually identify and photograph any fungal filaments on the KOH slide before inputting the image to the model, which requires a level of human expertise that would render the model essentially useless. To develop a model capable of automated KOH smear interpretation without requiring any human expertise or image preselection, we adapted our framework to enable interpretation of photographs of the entire KOH smear obtained using whole slide imaging (WSI).

The advent of WSI has enabled the digitization of microscopic slides, facilitating remote analysis and potential automation of the diagnostic process. WSIs typically consist of obtaining high-magnification images at different focal planes and magnification powers, which are collated into a single large file. This creates a digital representation of the entire microscopic specimen.

- **Figure 1**: Whole slide image of a KOH smear demonstrating fungal filaments. The WSI file (visualized on the left with low magnification) allows visualization of patches at different magnifications, enabling detailed observation of fungal filaments (see red box). KOH = potassium hydroxide; WSI = whole slide imaging.

Although the KOH smears were labeled by the physician on site, we needed to rel

### Evaluation of two MALDI-TOF MS systems and extraction methods for identification of filamentous fungi recovered from clinical specimens [^114Mxub9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Filamentous fungi, commonly referred to as molds, are ubiquitous in the environment but can also serve as significant human pathogens. Infections caused by these organisms are often associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among immunocompromised individuals. Clinical mycology laboratories are crucial for culturing and identifying molds. At the time of writing, the standard-of-care identification method for molds involves phenotypic macroscopic and microscopic characterization.

There is growing evidence that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which has revolutionized clinical bacteriology, can enhance mold identification. Potential benefits of using MALDI-TOF MS for this purpose include improved species-level accuracy, faster turnaround times, and a reduced training period for laboratory staff — an important consideration given the current shortages of medical laboratory technologists and an aging workforce. Additionally, identifying molds before colony maturation using MALDI-TOF MS could help mitigate laboratory-acquired infections.

Two key factors for successful mold identification by MALDI-TOF MS are the extraction step and the robustness of the spectra database. The extraction process is vital for inactivating infectious mold spores and improving run spectra. Each MALDI-TOF MS manufacturer recommends a specific mold extraction protocol; however, various studies have suggested modified or alternative approaches, with varying levels of success and feasibility for clinical implementation. The NIH extraction method is one of the more prominent alternatives.

### Is the physical functioning of older adults with diabetes associated with the processes and outcomes of care? Evidence from translating research into action for diabetes (TRIAD) [^11133ARB]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: To examine the relationship between physical function limitations and diabetes self-management, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes in adults ≥ 65 years of age with Type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: We studied 1796 participants 65 years of age and older in managed care health plans enrolled in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD). Physical functioning was assessed at baseline with the Physical Component Summary of the Short Form-12 Health Survey. Diabetes self-management was assessed with follow-up surveys, while processes of care (e.g. eye examinations, urine microalbumin testing, foot examinations) and intermediate health outcomes (HbA(1c), blood pressure, LDL cholesterol) were assessed with medical chart reviews. Multivariate regression models were constructed to examine the associations between physical function limitations and outcomes.

- **Results**: Frequency of eye examinations (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.49–0.99) was the only process of care worse for participants with physical function limitations (n = 573) compared with those without limitations (n = 618). Neither self-management nor intermediate outcomes differed by whether patients had or did not have physical function limitations.

- **Conclusion**: Limitations in physical functioning, as assessed by the Short Form-12, were not associated with substantial differences in diabetes care in adults ≥ 65 years of age enrolled in managed care health plans.

### Culturing dermatophytes rapidly from each toe web by fingertip [^114eBDbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of tinea pedis is usually confirmed by microscopy and culture of skin scrapings. Isolating dermatophytes by fungal culture provides more reliable proof of infection and has the advantage of identifying the causative organisms. Nevertheless, culture examination is complementary to microscopy and is not routinely performed because it is time- and cost-intensive.

Herein, we propose a new culturing method, the 'finger-sampling method', for collecting dermatophytes from patients' toe webs using the examiner's fingertip as a sample collection tool. Using this method, four toe webs of a foot can be examined at one time on one culture dish. Every toe web of 50 patients with untreated tinea pedis was examined, and dermatophytes were grown from 83 out of 107 (78%) KOH-positive toe webs. The isolation ratio by the finger-sampling method was comparable to that by traditional slant culture of skin scrapings performed by skilled practitioners.

Culture results were also positive in 19 out of 53 (36%) diseased but KOH-negative toe webs and in 38 (16%) normal toe webs, suggesting the existence of an unidentified infection. Additionally, we confirmed the efficacy of this method for detecting dermatophyte attachment on the healthy toe web skin of volunteers who had just been exposed to contaminated areas, i.e. Japanese public baths or a bath mat stepped on by a patient disseminating dermatophyte propagules.

### Touch preparation for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated aspergillosis [^1171GZG8]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In critically ill, immunocompromised patients, in whom aspergillosis is most often suspected, the most accurate tests, such as bronchial alveolar lavage, may not be feasible. Cultures can take several days to grow, and a negative culture does not rule out a fungal etiology. Computed tomography findings for pulmonary aspergillosis are not specific, as other bacterial or fungal infections may look similar. Serum testing with galactomannan and β-glucan assays can be helpful; however, false-positive results may occur in the presence of certain antibiotics, other fungi, or bacteria. Other noninvasive methods are being actively investigated, including polymerase chain reaction, lateral flow devices, volatile organic compounds, Aspergillus-derived siderophores, and mass spectrometry, but these have not yet been validated in large clinical trials.

- **Touch preparation technique**: The touch preparation for direct microscopy of biopsied skin may show fungal organisms that can expedite the initiation of appropriate treatment. Although few cases are reported in the literature, a touch preparation slide takes only a few minutes and may be a useful routine practice when taking skin biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients. When secondary cutaneous invasive aspergillosis is suspected, it is crucial to ensure that tissue for touch preparation is recovered from the base of the biopsy section. Skin manifestations result from fungal invasion of subcutaneous vessels and fat.

### Challenges and predictive value of morphologic features in panfungal sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues: A 5-year retrospective study [^111VtnhE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

Fungal culture and histopathology remain the gold standard for identifying fungal infections and provide valuable insight into the associated host inflammatory response; however, fungal cultures have low sensitivity, and apart from Fusarium species, molds are rarely isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood cultures. Cultures also carry a long turnaround time, limiting their utility. Histopathologic evaluation facilitates rapid diagnosis, especially when a fungal infection is clinically unsuspected and cultures are not available; however, the morphologic overlap among many fungal organisms challenges efforts at genus-level and species-level identification. Furthermore, although fungal infections occur throughout every organ system and are identified by surgical pathologists from every subspecialty, there is currently no well-established, standardized approach for diagnosing or reporting fungal infections in tissue.

The introduction of DNA sequencing techniques for fungal identification from sterile body fluids and tissue specimens has the potential for more accurate and timely diagnosis. Panfungal sequencing (PFS) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue can contribute to the specific genus-level and species-level identification of fungal organisms in tissue sections. Multiple studies have demonstrated shorter turnaround time and sensitivities that range from 51% to 63% compared with culture. Panfungal sequencing has previously been shown to be most effective when fungal elements are identified by histopathology.

### Comparison of different methods of isolation of DNA of commonly encountered Candida species and its quantitation by using a real-time PCR-based assay [^116DMNyv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Molecular diagnosis based on genomic amplification methods, such as real-time PCR assay, has been reported as an alternative to conventional culture for the early detection of invasive candidiasis. However, a major limitation of the molecular method is the difficulty associated with breaking fungal cell walls, as the DNA extraction step still requires more than half of a working day. It has been suggested that PCR detection of free template DNA in serum is preferred over the use of whole blood for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis.

In this study, two conventional procedures were evaluated along with three commercially available kits:

- **The first conventional procedure (HLGT method)**: Boiling sera in an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent.

- **The second conventional procedure (PKPC method)**: Utilizes proteinase K digestion followed by organic extraction.

These procedures, along with the three commercially available kits for DNA isolation, were evaluated for sensitivity, purity, cost, and use of template for most clinically important Candida species in a TaqMan-based PCR assay.

To optimize these procedures, the study evaluated the effect of adding 0.5% bovine serum albumin to DNA extracts and found it decreased the effects of inhibitors. The QIAamp DNA blood kit significantly shortened the duration of DNA isolation but was among the most expensive procedures. Furthermore, the QIAamp DNA blood kit was as sensitive as the HLGT DNA isolation method for PCR amplification from 52 serum samples from hematology or oncology patients with clinically proven or suspected systemic Candida infections. All PCR-positive samples showed approximately the same Candida species load by both procedures.

### PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay for fast and accurate identification of causative species in superficial fungal infections [^116YPdcy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are a very common problem in dermatological clinics. The diagnostic method of fungal culture is time-consuming and has inconsistent sensitivity. Therefore, a practical method for rapid and accurate identification of the species causing superficial fungal infections is needed.

- **Aim**: To compare PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay (PCR-REBA) with conventional fungal diagnostic methods to determine the reliability of PCR-REBA for the diagnosis and species identification in superficial fungal infections.

- **Methods**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, fungal culture, conventional real-time PCR, and PCR-REBA were used to assess 83 specimens, and the results from each method were compared.

- **Results**: Of the 83 specimens, 44 specimens that were positive by fungal culture had 62.7% agreement with PCR-REBA. Compared with real-time PCR, there was 68.7% agreement with fungal culture, but 91.6% agreement with PCR-REBA. When the comparison was made using the 55 specimens that gave positive results in both KOH preparation and fungal culture, there was 85.5% agreement with real-time PCR for fungal culture, but 94.5% agreement with PCR-REBA.

- **Conclusions**: Compared with KOH preparation or fungal culture, PCR-REBA has higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, PCR-REBA could be a useful method in clinical settings because it can identify species quickly and accurately and can also determine the existence of pathogens.

### Cost-effective method for identification of dimorphic fungi [^115S2quM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Traditional methods for identifying dimorphic fungi require that the mold be converted to the yeast phase at 35 to 37 degrees Celsius. We present a time- and cost-saving method to confirm the identification of a dimorph by using special stains to demonstrate the yeast phase directly growing in the original clinical specimens.

### Antifungal therapy in infants and children with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infections [^116QpkUy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children, and optimal treatment strategies are yet to be defined. This review aims to systematically identify and summarize the effects of different antifungal therapies in children with proven, probable, or suspected invasive fungal infections.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2008), EMBASE (1980 to September 2008), and CINAHL (1988 to September 2008) without language restrictions. We also hand-searched reference lists and abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings and contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing a systemic antifungal agent with a comparator (including placebo) in children (one month to 16 years) with proven, probable, or suspected invasive fungal infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. We synthesized data using the random-effects model and expressed results as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Main results**: We included seven trials of antifungal agents in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia (suspected fungal infection) and candidemia or invasive candidiasis (proven fungal infection). Four trials compared a lipid preparation of ampho…
