## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for pain in the dorsolateral forearm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for pain in the dorsolateral forearm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise anatomy and neuroanatomy of the dorsolateral forearm. Then, I should organize the differential by major etiologic categories and prioritize the most likely neurologic causes. Next, I will consider key musculoskeletal mimics, traumatic and mass lesions, and systemic contributors. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic strategy including targeted examination maneuvers, electrodiagnostics, and imaging. Finally, I should synthesize red flags, pitfalls like double crush, and a practical decision pathway to guide workup and management, checking each step against the best available evidence.

> Let me first localize the problem anatomically: dorsolateral forearm pain implies the posteroradial aspect of the proximal-to-mid forearm where radial nerve branches predominate, especially the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) for motor to extensors and the superficial radial nerve (SRN) for dorsoradial sensory territory, with ECRB/ECRL/extensor digitorum contributions to symptom provocation through resisted extension and supination, which I should confirm on exam [^111P9ZA9] [^117Bf7ZX].

> I need to organize etiologies by major categories to avoid anchoring bias: neurologic (radial nerve entrapments, cervical radiculopathy, neuropathies), musculoskeletal/tendinous (particularly lateral epicondylitis and other extensor tendinopathies), traumatic/mechanical, mass lesions (ganglion, neuroma, tumors), inflammatory/autoimmune, vascular, and systemic/other causes, because this framing improves diagnostic yield and sequencing of tests [^113YPjGS].

> Next, I should prioritize neurologic causes because the dorsolateral forearm is radial-nerve dominant and entrapment syndromes are frequent culprits; that means carefully differentiating radial tunnel syndrome (RTS), posterior interosseous nerve syndrome (PINS), and SRN compression, while using exam maneuvers and electrodiagnostics judiciously given known limitations for RTS confirmation and the role of imaging to localize compressive lesions or denervation patterns [^117Bf7ZX] [^111P9ZA9] [^113SvQ64].

> For radial tunnel syndrome, let me think about the classic pattern: deep aching pain 3–5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle, exacerbated by resisted forearm supination and middle-finger extension, usually without objective motor weakness and often with normal electrodiagnostics; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — initially I wrote "pure pain with no motor deficit", but I should verify the nuance that subtle weakness may be missed and that pain-predominant presentations without clear M4 deficits are reported, underscoring clinical diagnosis and the controversial nature of confirmatory testing; the "rule of nine" palpation map can aid localization, and imaging can exclude masses when symptoms persist [^117Bf7ZX] [^1161UNrw] [^112qoUeu].

> For posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, I should confirm that motor deficits are the hallmark: varying degrees of finger/thumb and sometimes wrist extension weakness, possibly radial deviation on attempted extension, with supportive EMG evidence of denervation and MRI showing denervation edema or a compressing lesion at the arcade of Frohse or along the supinator; sensory loss is absent because PIN is motor, which helps distinguish it from SRN pathology [^111P9ZA9] [^117VjTJH].

> For superficial radial nerve compression (Wartenberg's syndrome/cheiralgia paresthetica), I need to check for purely sensory symptoms — paresthesias, burning, dysesthesias over the dorsoradial hand and distal forearm, often provoked by tight straps or repetitive wrist motion, a positive Tinel over the SRN at the distal radial forearm, and potential relief with diagnostic nerve block; wait, I should double-check that I'm not conflating Wartenberg's sign (ulnar) with Wartenberg's syndrome (radial) — the former is small-finger abduction in ulnar neuropathy, whereas here we're discussing SRN entrapment; exam over the SRN and consideration of overlapping LABCN territory improve diagnostic precision [^111Czef5] [^113h6zux].

> I will now examine high radial nerve entrapment or injury more proximally when there is wrist drop with triceps involvement or sensory changes suggesting main-trunk pathology at the spiral groove or axilla, frequently traumatic or iatrogenic; imaging and electrodiagnostics help localize and stage, and humeral shaft fractures are a classic association that I should keep in mind [^117VjTJH] [^111P9ZA9].

> But wait, what if the pain is actually referred from the neck; I should consider cervical radiculopathy, especially C6–C7 patterns with neck pain, dermatomal paresthesias, and myotomal weakness spanning multiple peripheral nerve territories along with a positive Spurling's test, where MRI of the cervical spine and EMG can clarify root-level involvement; initially, I almost cited a postoperative ulnar neuropathy paper to justify radiculopathy, but hold on, I should verify — that source is more appropriate as a reminder of broad differentials and the double-crush concept rather than a direct radiculopathy reference, so I will rely on focused double-crush literature to support concurrent proximal and distal nerve pathology that can blunt outcomes if only one site is treated [^112g8yCT] [^1151PtVY].

> Let me consider systemic peripheral neuropathies next; symmetric or multifocal involvement with mixed sensory and motor deficits, often bilateral and stocking-glove, should trigger a metabolic workup, and electrodiagnostics can help differentiate focal entrapment from diffuse neuropathy; mixed-nerve forearm conduction can stay normal in focal entrapment but slows in generalized neuropathy, which is useful when entrapment coexists with systemic disease [^116UDqke].

> I should now review musculoskeletal mimics, especially lateral epicondylitis, which classically presents with lateral epicondylar tenderness, pain with resisted wrist extension and gripping, and pain that can radiate into the forearm; diagnosis is clinical, but in chronic or refractory cases, ultrasound or MRI can document tendinosis or partial tearing and help exclude alternate pathology, starting with radiographs per ACR guidance when chronic elbow pain is evaluated [^115Rfet1] [^115rsyDi] [^112ZR2zY].

> Hold on, I should verify other extensor tendinopathies outside the epicondyle, such as extensor carpi ulnaris or specific extensor mass overuse, where focal pain is provoked by the implicated motion and can overlap symptomatically with RTS; careful resisted testing in the forearm's mid-portion and targeted ultrasound can delineate the tendon of interest and avoid mislabeling as nerve entrapment [^112ZExiL] [^117LUfqj].

> Next, I need to check for traumatic or mechanical causes; acute radial shaft or distal radius fractures can produce dorsolateral forearm pain and secondarily injure the radial nerve or SRN, while some wrist fractures and malalignments can alter load and provoke forearm pain; careful history, exam, and appropriate radiographs or CT are essential when trauma is suspected, with MRI or ultrasound added for soft-tissue or nerve concerns [^117VjTJH] [^113XJ29N].

> I must not miss acute compartment syndrome when there is severe pain out of proportion, tense compartments, pain with passive stretch, and evolving neurologic changes; this is a surgical emergency where prompt fasciotomy is limb-saving, and any delay for advanced imaging is inappropriate, so early surgical consultation is critical based on clinical findings [^1151PtVY].

> Let me consider space-occupying lesions; ganglion cysts are common and can compress the SRN along its subcutaneous course, producing fluctuating dorsolateral pain and dysesthesia, where ultrasound is excellent for detection; painful neuromas may occur after lateral epicondylitis surgery or other iatrogenic insults, with focal Tinel and scar tenderness, and MRI or targeted ultrasound can aid preoperative planning for neurolysis or neurectomy when conservative care fails [^111Czef5] [^116ewey9].

> I should also account for inflammatory arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome when symptom severity or distribution is disproportionate to local findings; persistent swelling, morning stiffness, trophic changes, allodynia, and vasomotor instability should broaden the workup to include rheumatologic evaluation and CRPS criteria, recognizing that upper extremity pain etiologies often cross categories [^113YPjGS].

> Now, I need to detail the diagnostic principles; electrodiagnostic studies help localize and grade PIN palsy, exclude cervical radiculopathy, and detect diffuse neuropathy, yet they are often normal in pain-predominant RTS, so EMG/NCS are most helpful to rule in motor denervation or alternate sites and rule out competing diagnoses, not to "prove" RTS; concurrently, patient-reported and performance measures such as PRTEE, DASH, pain-free grip strength, and pressure pain thresholds offer standardized baselines and track response [^111P9ZA9] [^113SvQ64] [^111nKr2o] [^117Q4LKo].

> Next, I should review imaging; high-resolution ultrasound is well suited to evaluate nerve caliber changes, dynamic irritation, ganglia, and focal compressive lesions along the radial nerve path, while MRI excels at depicting denervation edema, tendon degeneration, and occult masses; per ACR chronic elbow pain guidance, start with radiographs, then use ultrasound or MRI to evaluate tendons and nerves in persistent cases or when red flags exist, and consider CT/MRI for suspected intra-articular pathology or occult fractures [^112HHudK] [^111nnukF] [^115C6Nag] [^115rsyDi] [^111fWAmP] [^117VjTJH].

> I should double-check an epidemiologic pitfall: isolated forearm pain is uncommon and often coexists with elbow or wrist pain, which means a site-specific lens can be misleading; thus, I need to examine proximally and distally along the limb and the cervical spine to avoid missing concomitant pathology or double-crush scenarios, especially when initial treatment at a single site disappoints [^113hM7Xg] [^112g8yCT].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic flow while verifying red flags: first, screen for trauma and compartment syndrome and act emergently when indicated; second, decide whether the pattern is primarily neurologic versus tendinous by using resisted middle-finger extension and resisted supination for RTS, objective extension weakness for PINS, Tinel over SRN with sensory symptoms for Wartenberg's syndrome, and lateral epicondylar tenderness with resisted wrist extension for lateral epicondylitis; third, if the pattern is ambiguous or severe, obtain targeted ultrasound and/or MRI and pursue EMG/NCS to localize neuropathy and exclude cervical radiculopathy; fourth, reassess for double crush if symptoms persist despite localized treatment, and extend evaluation proximally and distally as needed [^117Bf7ZX] [^111P9ZA9] [^111nnukF] [^112g8yCT].

> In closing, dorsolateral forearm pain most commonly reflects radial-nerve–related entrapments, particularly RTS or PINS, or lateral epicondylitis and extensor tendinopathies that often overlap, so I need to triangulate with precise provocative testing, judicious electrodiagnostics, and selective imaging; I should remember that EMG can be normal in pain-predominant RTS, that masses and postsurgical neuromas can mimic entrapment, and that proximal and distal evaluations are essential to detect double crush and concurrent regional drivers of pain [^117Bf7ZX] [^113SvQ64] [^116ewey9] [^112g8yCT].

---

Dorsolateral forearm pain most commonly reflects **lateral epicondylitis** or **radial tunnel syndrome**, but the differential is broad, spanning nerve entrapments, tendinopathies, fractures, and systemic or referred causes [^113YPjGS] [^117Bf7ZX]. A **focused history and physical examination**, supported by **selective imaging and electrodiagnostics**, are essential to distinguish these entities and guide management [^112ZR2zY] [^111nnukF].

## Musculoskeletal causes

### Tendinopathies

- **Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)**: Pain at the lateral epicondyle radiating into the dorsal lateral forearm; worsens with wrist extension and gripping; common in repetitive wrist extension activities [^113GMVy9] [^111EwuPk].

- **Extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis tendinopathy**: Pain with resisted wrist extension and tenderness over the tendons [^115rbi49] [^113YPjGS].

- **De Quervain's tenosynovitis**: First dorsal compartment pain radiating proximally [^113h6zux]; positive Finkelstein test [^113XJ29N].

---

### Muscle strains

Muscle strains include **brachioradialis strain**, presenting with pain during resisted elbow flexion — especially with the forearm in neutral — and **extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis strain**, which causes pain with resisted wrist extension.

---

### Overuse syndromes

Overuse syndromes include **repetitive strain injury (RSI)**, typically work-related and characterized by diffuse forearm pain from repetitive tasks [^114jvf6H] [^113hM7Xg].

---

## Nerve entrapment syndromes

### Radial nerve entrapments

- **Radial tunnel syndrome**: Posterior interosseous nerve compression; pain 3–5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle [^112qoUeu], worsened by resisted middle finger extension; minimal motor deficits [^113SvQ64] [^117Bf7ZX].

- **Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome**: Motor weakness of wrist and finger extensors with minimal sensory loss [^113SvQ64] [^111P9ZA9].

- **Wartenberg's syndrome**: Superficial radial nerve entrapment; dorsal lateral forearm and hand paresthesias, worsened by wrist flexion and ulnar deviation [^113SvQ64] [^111Czef5].

---

### Other nerve entrapments

Other nerve entrapments include **lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve entrapment**, presenting with sensory loss over the lateral forearm, and **cervical radiculopathy (C6-C7)**, characterized by neck pain radiating to the dorsolateral forearm with accompanying sensory and motor deficits [^112g8yCT] [^112bZVML].

---

## Skeletal injuries

### Fractures

Fractures include **radial shaft fracture**, which presents with pain, swelling, and deformity of the dorsolateral forearm; **distal radius fracture**, characterized by pain with swelling and deformity near the wrist; and **radial head fracture**, which causes elbow pain radiating into the forearm with limited pronation/supination.

---

### Stress fractures

Stress fractures may involve the **radial shaft**, presenting with insidious pain in athletes with repetitive loading [^111nnukF].

---

### Ligamentous injuries

Ligamentous injuries include **lateral collateral ligament injury**, causing lateral elbow instability with pain radiating into the forearm [^111fWAmP].

---

## Vascular conditions

Vascular conditions include **radial artery thrombosis/embolism**, which causes acute pain with pallor, pulselessness, and paresthesia, and **compartment syndrome**, marked by severe pain, swelling, and neurovascular compromise.

---

## Systemic and referred pain conditions

Systemic and referred causes include **rheumatoid arthritis**, which causes inflammatory joint pain with swelling and stiffness, and **complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**, marked by severe pain with autonomic changes after injury; cervical spine pathology can also refer pain to the forearm [^113YPjGS].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a **focused history** — covering onset, duration, activity, trauma, and systemic symptoms — and a **physical examination** assessing inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength, sensory testing, and provocative maneuvers (Cozen's, Mill's, Finkelstein, Tinel's).

---

### Imaging studies

- **Plain radiographs**: Initial assessment for fractures or bony abnormalities [^112ZR2zY].

- **Ultrasound**: Tendon and nerve evaluation; dynamic assessment [^112HHudK].

- **MRI**: Soft tissue, nerve, and occult fracture evaluation [^111nnukF].

- **CT**: Detailed bony assessment when MRI is contraindicated [^111fWAmP].

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

Electrodiagnostic studies, including **nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG)**, help distinguish nerve entrapments from radiculopathies [^116UDqke] [^116uuAGH].

---

## Management strategies

Management ranges from **conservative management** — including activity modification, physical therapy, NSAIDs, bracing, and corticosteroid injections — to **surgical management** for refractory cases or structural lesions (nerve decompression, tendon repair, fracture fixation) [^112X5pjb] [^115QrW7A] [^115rbi49].

---

Dorsolateral forearm pain has a **broad differential**, spanning musculoskeletal, neurologic, skeletal, vascular, and systemic causes. A structured evaluation with targeted imaging and electrodiagnostics enables accurate diagnosis and guides effective treatment [^115C6Nag].

### Unusual compression neuropathies of the forearm, part I: radial nerve [^113SvQ64]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Peripheral compression neuropathies are familiar to the hand surgeon. Although compression neuropathies of the forearm are far less common than those of the wrist (namely, carpal tunnel syndrome), for the patient suffering from one of these neuropathies, a missed diagnosis has far-reaching consequences. In this two-part review (I: Radial Nerve; II: Median Nerve), several compression neuropathies of the forearm are examined. We will first discuss compression neuropathies affecting the radial nerve: (1) posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, (2) radial tunnel syndrome, and (3) superficial radial nerve compression (Wartenberg's syndrome).

### Clinical differentiation of upper extremity pain etiologies [^113YPjGS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Upper extremity pain can result from many overlapping etiologies. These can be categorized into anatomic regions and specific organ systems. Anatomically, pain etiologies are classified into four major groups: neurologic, musculoskeletal, vascular, and other (e.g. tumor, infection). Knowledge of the characteristic clinical presentations and physical examination findings of each group can help distinguish the source of the patient's complaints quickly, thus facilitating an accurate clinical diagnosis that leads to appropriate diagnostic measures and treatment.

- **Neurologic causes**: Focus on neurologic causes of upper extremity pain, such as cervical spine pathology, peripheral nerve compression, neuropathy, and their distinguishing characteristics (e.g. periscapular pain, two-point discrimination, signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI), helps determine the appropriate diagnosis.

- **Musculoskeletal causes**: Consider musculoskeletal causes of shoulder and elbow pain, such as adhesive capsulitis, calcific tendinitis, biceps tendinitis, and synovitis, to assist in clinical differentiation.

### Lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^115Rfet1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow", is a common musculotendinous degenerative disorder of the extensor origin at the lateral humeral epicondyle. Repetitive occupational or athletic activities involving wrist extension and supination are thought to be causative. The typical symptoms include lateral elbow pain, pain with wrist extension, and weakened grip strength. The diagnosis is made clinically through history and physical examination; however, a thorough understanding of the differential diagnosis is imperative to prevent unnecessary testing and therapies. Most patients improve with nonoperative measures, such as activity modification, physical therapy, and injections. A small percentage of patients will require surgical release of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon. Common methods of release may be performed via percutaneous, arthroscopic, or open approaches.

### A panorama of radial nerve pathologies: An imaging diagnosis: A step ahead [^117VjTJH]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The radial nerve has a long and tortuous course in the upper limb. Injury to the nerve can occur due to a multitude of causes at many potential sites along its course. The most common site of involvement is in the proximal forearm, affecting the posterior interosseous branch, while the main branch of the radial nerve is injured in fractures of the humeral shaft. Signs and symptoms of radial neuropathy depend upon the site of injury.

Injury to the nerve distal to innervation of the triceps brachii results in loss of extensor function with sparing of function of the triceps, resulting in the characteristic 'wrist drop'. Injury in the mid-arm is associated with loss of sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the hand, the dorsal aspect of the radial three-and-a-half digits, and in the first web space. Involvement of only the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) results in the weakness of the wrist and digit extensors.

Diagnosis relies on clinical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging findings. Plain radiographs are used to identify fracture sites, callus, or tumors as a cause of compression. Technological advances in ultrasonography have allowed direct visualization of the involved nerve with an assessment of the exact site, extent, and type of injury. It yields unmatched information about anatomical details of the nerve. MR imaging adds to soft-tissue details and helps in characterizing the lesion. This pictorial review aims to illustrate a wide spectrum of causes of radial neuropathy and emphasizes the importance of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of neuropathies.

### Double crush syndrome [^112g8yCT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Double crush syndrome is characterized by distinct compression at two or more locations along the course of a peripheral nerve that can coexist and synergistically increase symptom intensity. Dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may result from persistent pathology at another location along the peripheral nerve. The diagnosis of double crush syndrome is controversial; some scientists and surgeons regard it as an illness construction that may do more harm than good by emphasizing an objective pathophysiologic explanation for symptoms that may be more psychosocially mediated, such as unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction.

However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy, contributing to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patient expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the upper limb: a pictorial review [^112nLzwx]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The ulnar nerve is shown. The most common entrapment neuropathies of the ulnar nerve are the cubital tunnel syndrome at the elbow and the ulnar tunnel syndrome at the wrist.

- **Figure 14**:
	- The illustration depicts cases of ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow:
		- **A**: Axial PDFS elbow in a 50-year-old female with ulnar nerve neuropathy. The ulnar nerve (white arrow) shows increased signal intensity at the level of the cubital tunnel and is focally enlarged.
		- **B**: Sagittal PDFS elbow of a 54-year-old male with ulnar neuropathy. The ulnar nerve is enlarged (white arrow), with compression as it enters between the two flexor carpi ulnaris heads (blue arrows).
		- **C**: Axial PD elbow of a 60-year-old male showing the normal variant anconeus epitrochlearis (blue arrow) superficial to the ulnar nerve (white arrow) at the cubital tunnel. This can predispose the nerve to entrapment.

- **Figure 15**:
	- Axial PD (a) and PDFS (b) palm of an 80-year-old female show increased edema and volume loss in the intrinsic muscles of the hand radially (white arrows). This is consistent with a deep ulnar nerve denervation pattern.

Digital nerves arise from the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. They are divided into palmar and dorsal branches, providing sensory and motor supply to the distal fingers. Injury to the digital nerves impairs hand dexterity and causes numbness and/or pain, which radiates down the fingers. They are most commonly damaged by trauma, including surgical trauma as shown in Fig. 17; however, other causes of entrapment include inflammation, vascular malformations, and neoplasms.

### Chronic forearm pain presents as a transient and indistinct pain site in a community setting: Results from a UK population survey [^113hM7Xg]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To investigate the prevalence of chronic forearm pain in a non-occupational community setting over a 2-year period, a longitudinal community-based postal questionnaire survey was conducted in the south-eastern quadrant of England.

We received 2493/4172 (60%) responses at baseline and followed up with 429 of these participants 2 years later; 252 responded (59%). Forearm pain prevalence was 4% at baseline and 5% at follow-up. Over 95% of those with forearm pain reported pain in other areas [odds ratio 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3–1.7)] and it was most commonly associated with elbow and wrist pain. Seventy-six percent of those with forearm pain at baseline recovered. At follow-up, 78% of those with chronic forearm pain had new-onset forearm pain.

Persistent forearm pain (pain for over 2 years) was rare, and the capacity for recovery was good (76%). Isolated forearm pain as a diagnostic category is of little utility. Treating and managing forearm pain in a site-specific manner is unlikely to be successful due to its strong association with pain in other areas. In the community, forearm pain laterality was not evident; our findings suggest that forearm pain in the workplace is influenced by different factors compared to those in a community setting.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: Systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^112PqCnB]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), also known as tennis elbow or lateral elbow tendinopathy, is an overuse injury of the short extensor of the wrist (extensor carpi radialis brevis) and a common cause of pain in the lateral side of the elbow. The etiology of LE is not completely understood, but it is assumed that overuse leads to increased tenocyte proliferation and production of ground substance. LE is most prevalent among people of working age, between 20 and 65 years. It is a frequently reported condition in several working populations, such as computer users, manufacturing workers, and service workers. LE might develop into a chronic disorder; for example, a study by Nilson et al. showed that 54% and 55% of patients, respectively, still experienced pain and function loss after 2 years. LE can result in loss of function, such as decreased handgrip strength. As a result, LE can lead to long-term and frequent sick leave of workers and potential productivity loss. Given that recovery can take more than a year, LE in workers imposes a high burden on society.

While there are several treatment options for LE, such as corticosteroid injections, platelet-rich plasma injections, and surgery, evidence on the effectiveness of these treatments is inconclusive. As the majority of cases of LE are self-limiting when the patient avoids aggravating activities, the prevention of overuse that causes LE is crucial. Effective interventions to prevent work-related LE should be based on evidence-based risk factors. This indicates that knowledge of the risk factors of LE is needed to implement appropriate measures.

### Mixed median nerve forearm conduction velocity in the presence of focal compression neuropathy at the wrist versus peripheral neuropathy [^116UDqke]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to establish normal values for the conduction velocity of the mixed median nerve in the forearm. The study also aimed to determine the utility of mixed median nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies across the forearm in the differential diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), peripheral neuropathy, and CTS with peripheral neuropathy.

The design followed a criterion standard approach where mixed median NCV studies across the forearm were added to routine CTS investigational protocols. Conducted in a university outpatient setting with a rural referral base, the study involved thirty healthy volunteers and sixty patients referred with symptoms and signs suggestive of CTS and/or peripheral neuropathy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Motor sensory and mixed median nerve conduction velocity across the forearm were the main outcomes measured.

The results indicated that the mean mixed median NCV across the forearm was 64.5 m/s in both healthy subjects and those with CTS. Conversely, the mean mixed NCV in subjects with peripheral neuropathy was 54 m/s, even in the presence of CTS.

The conclusion drawn from the study suggests that mixed median NCV in the forearm, when added to standard protocols, is helpful in differentiating the diagnosis of CTS from peripheral neuropathy and CTS with peripheral neuropathy.

### Painful arm and moving fingers: Clinical features of four new cases [^111RXnAz]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

The syndrome of painful arm and moving fingers associates pain in one arm or hand with involuntary movement of one or several fingers. In the four cases described, an association between a central and a peripheral nervous system lesion is demonstrated or suspected. Treatment of the condition is disappointing.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^116136bG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This study identifies the 50 most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow", and includes foundational investigations that have provided knowledge and understanding of the underlying etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. This list may be used to aid in the education of orthopaedic residency and fellowship trainees because it serves as a source for establishing a reading curriculum on lateral epicondylitis. Many of the articles included were randomized controlled trials, showing the modern-day emphasis on evidence-based medicine to evaluate outcomes for a condition for which the optimal management remains controversial.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: Carpal tunnel syndrome [^113XxEdc]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for carpal tunnel syndrome, specifically in clinical assessment (sensory function tests), AHUEPT/AOPT 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing using the 2.83 or 3.22 monofilament as the threshold for normal light touch sensation, and static two-point discrimination on the middle finger to help determine the extent of nerve damage in the evaluation of patients with suspected CTS. For patients with suspected moderate-to-severe CTS, assess any radial finger using the 3.22 filament as the threshold for normal. It is recommended to repeat Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing by the same provider.

### Experimental muscle hyperalgesia modulates sensorimotor cortical excitability, which is partially altered by unaccustomed exercise [^111gK6bD]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Impaired corticomotor function is reported in patients with lateral epicondylalgia, but the causal link to pain or musculotendinous overloading is unclear. In this study, sensorimotor cortical changes were investigated using a model of persistent pain combined with an overloading condition. In 24 healthy subjects, the effect of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced pain, combined with delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), was examined on pain perception, pressure pain sensitivity, maximal force, and sensorimotor cortical excitability.

Two groups (NGF alone and NGF + DOMS) received injections of NGF into the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle at day 0, day 2, and day 4. At day 4, the NGF + DOMS group undertook wrist eccentric exercise to induce DOMS in the ECRB muscle. Muscle soreness scores, pressure pain thresholds over the ECRB muscle, maximal grip force, transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping of the cortical ECRB muscle representation, and somatosensory-evoked potentials from radial nerve stimulation were recorded at day 0, day 4, and day 6.

Compared with day 0, day 4 showed in both groups: (1) increased muscle soreness (P < 0.01); (2) reduced pressure pain thresholds (P < 0.01); (3) increased motor map volume (P < 0.01); and (4) decreased frontal N30 somatosensory-evoked potential. At day 6, compared with day 4, only the DOMS + NGF group showed: (1) increased muscle soreness score (P < 0.01); (2) decreased grip force (P < 0.01); and (3) decreased motor map volume (P < 0.05). The NGF group did not show any difference on the remaining outcomes from day 4 to day 6.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^1151PtVY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Whereas the signs and symptoms of ulnar nerve dysfunction are straightforward to detect at the bedside, identifying the site, severity, and aetiology of the condition is more challenging. Neurological examination of the limbs and cranial nerves should be documented at the earliest opportunity in a patient suspected of having postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN). Routine screening of patients for evidence of PUN in the recovery room should not be undertaken. Sensory findings in PUN may include paraesthesia, numbness, pain, and loss of two-point discrimination in the ring and little finger.

Broad differential diagnoses to consider in such cases are muscle diseases, radiculopathy, myelopathy, spinal cord trauma/infarction, and stroke. A brachial plexus lesion arising from compression on a cervical rib is a further differential diagnosis to consider. A pre-existing abnormality along the course of a peripheral nerve, for example, an area of nerve compression, may increase the likelihood that a further physically distinct insult will manifest with signs of symptoms of nerve injury. This is known as the 'double-crush' phenomenon. A history of pre-existing neurological symptoms in the upper limb should, therefore, be sought. New, acute postoperative pain or paralysis should trigger assessment for compartment syndrome or acute vascular compromise. Communication to the patient of examination findings, possible diagnoses, and further assessment should be undertaken by the relevant anaesthetist and must be documented in the medical record.

### The cubital tunnel syndrome: a case report and discussion [^113A3drM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity. It presents as elbow, forearm, or hand pain in the ulnar nerve sensory distribution and results from overuse, trauma, or entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Proper physical diagnosis can localize the site of ulnar nerve entrapment to the elbow or wrist. Both conservative and operative modalities exist to treat cubital tunnel syndrome; however, the optimal management remains unclear.

### Looking further when symptoms are disproportionate to physical findings [^112ZExiL]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old man presents with left ulnar-side wrist pain during an ice hockey game, which prevented him from playing hockey or golf. There was no acute mechanism of injury. The clinical examination revealed only minimal tenderness and minimal pain with resisted wrist extension. Careful attention to precipitating factors led to testing resisted wrist extension with the forearm fully supinated, which reliably reproduced the intensity of the patient's symptoms and led to a diagnosis of extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy. A literature review suggested three additional special tests (two were positive) and management. However, a standard of care has yet to be established because neither the tests nor the management has been properly validated through research, thus leaving the management of this condition as an art.

### An unusual radial neuropathy [^1132pu4C]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman presented to her physician with left forearm pain of insidious onset, inability to extend the wrist, and numbness in the dorsal hand. An electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS) demonstrated radial neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left elbow/forearm, performed two months later, revealed edema and atrophy of the wrist extensor muscles, but no compressive lesion was identified. Due to a lack of improvement, and after consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon, a second, more detailed EMG/NCS was performed. This revealed severe radial motor and sensory neuropathy, with compression between the lateral and long heads of the triceps.

### Painful neuroma of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm after surgery for lateral humeral epicondylitis [^116ewey9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe a neuroma of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm that can cause pain following surgery for lateral humeral epicondylitis.

A retrospective chart review of nine patients experiencing pain after surgery for lateral humeral epicondylitis was conducted. The review evaluated their pain history, surgical findings during exploration of their painful lateral elbow scar, and surgical treatment outcomes.

In each of the nine patients, a neuroma of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm was located within the scar of the original lateral epicondylitis surgery. Surgical treatment for these patients involved resection of the neuroma and implantation of the proximal end of the nerve into the brachioradialis muscle proximal to the elbow joint. This approach resulted in excellent pain relief for eight patients, and good pain relief for one patient, with a mean follow-up time of 1.4 years (range: 1.0–2.6 years).

In conclusion, pain in the region of the scar after surgery for lateral humeral epicondylitis can be attributed to a neuroma of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. This painful neuroma can be effectively treated by resection and proximal implantation of the nerve into the brachioradialis muscle.

### The role of physical examinations in studies of musculoskeletal disorders of the elbow [^113ygbDV]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To present data on pain and physical findings from the elbow region, and to discuss the role of diagnostic criteria in epidemiological studies of epicondylitis, a subgroup of 1369 participants was selected from a cohort of computer workers. These participants, who reported at least moderate pain in the neck and upper extremities, were invited to a standardized physical examination. Two independent physical examinations were performed — one blinded and one not blinded to the medical history. Information concerning musculoskeletal symptoms was obtained through a baseline questionnaire and a similar questionnaire completed on the day of examination.

In the results, 349 participants met the authors' criteria for being an arm case, and 249 were classified as elbow cases. Among the 1369 participants, the prevalence of at least mild palpation tenderness and indirect tenderness at the lateral epicondyle was 5.8%. The occurrence of physical findings increased markedly by the level of pain score. Only about half of those with physical findings fulfilled the authors' pain criteria for having lateral epicondylitis. A significant portion of those with physical findings reported no pain at all in the elbow in either of the two questionnaires, 28% and 22%, respectively. Inter-examiner reliability between blinded and non-blinded examinations was found to be low, with a kappa value ranging from 0.34 to 0.40.

Very few individuals with at least moderate pain in the elbow region met common specific criteria for lateral epicondylitis. The occurrence of physical findings increased markedly by the level of pain score, and the associations were strongest with pain intensity scores.

### Advice to remain active with arm pain reduces disability [^114jvf6H]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

An estimated 4.4 million UK working days were lost in 2019/20 due to 'work-related neck/upper limb disorders'. Upper limb disorders account for 45% of all occupational diseases in Europe. Moreover, arm symptoms are frequently attributed to work and have led to workplace epidemics, including 'repetitive strain injury'. Some causes of arm pain have well-defined pathoanatomical features and diagnostic criteria, such as tenosynovitis, even if their aetiology is not fully understood. However, patients can present with pain and disability in the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand without any distinct pathoanatomical features. Either way, rates of disability are high. Among people consulting with pain affecting the elbow, forearm, wrist, and/or hand in the community, 50% reported persistent symptoms 12 months later, and 14% reported severely disabling symptoms.

Despite their frequency and impact, the best management practices for upper limb disorders remain unknown. Injections, medication, or physiotherapy might be effective in some conditions, but their clinical effects are inconsistent, and any benefit from advice to rest the arm or avoid occupational activities has not been established. Although psychosocial interventions, such as addressing health beliefs and encouraging activity and remaining at work, are potentially useful in managing arm pain, their effectiveness in a working population remains to be determined. For these reasons, the ARM pain trial was funded. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruited people with distal arm pain referred to physiotherapy and randomized them.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^1161UNrw]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

No reliable electrodiagnostic findings can help to establish a single diagnosis of RTS because there is no motor denervation. The syndrome is not detectable by pathophysiological or electrodiagnostic tests. There are no observable abnormalities in electromyography or nerve conduction tests in RTS. However, electromyography is considered helpful for ruling out cervical radiculopathy and detecting denervation or abnormalities in the motor units.

Owing to the difficulties in diagnosing RTS, including inconclusive electrodiagnostic studies and problems with the anatomical aspect of the syndrome, Loh et al. proposed the "rule of nine test". The proximal surface of the forearm is covered with a square divided into nine equal, smaller squares comprising three columns and three rows. Depending on the position of the radial nerve bifurcation, the PIN in the radial tunnel should be located under the proximal two or the three squares of the lateral column. In all squares, a tenderness test should be performed to identify the true origin of the symptoms and exclude other closely related pathologies such as lateral epicondylitis.

- **Radial and median nerve course**: The course of the radial and median nerves is depicted in nine zones with RN representing the radial nerve and MN the median nerve.

The outcome of surgical decompression for RTS is unpredictable; 67% of patients who underwent release surgery had good long-term results (minimal or no discomfort), 15% fair (symptoms improved but with moderate pain limiting activities), and 18% poor (pain did not allow normal activities to be resumed).

### Ulnar tunnel syndrome [^115bzJRw]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at or distal to the wrist, commonly referred to as ulnar tunnel syndrome, is an uncommon but well-documented condition. However, diagnosing ulnar tunnel syndrome can be difficult. Paresthesias may be nonspecific or related to coexisting pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8-T1 radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy, which complicates accurate diagnosis. Advances in electrodiagnosis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have improved diagnostic accuracy. This article offers an updated view of ulnar tunnel syndrome, its etiologies, diagnoses, and treatments.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Diagnosis and management [^116uuAGH]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with the condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger. Additional clues include positive physical examination findings such as the flick sign, Phalen maneuver, and median nerve compression test.

Although patients with typical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome do not need additional testing, ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and rule out other causes. If surgical decompression is planned, electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained to determine severity and surgical prognosis.

Conservative treatment may be offered initially to patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Options include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B6 are not effective therapies. Local corticosteroid injection can provide relief for more than one month and delay the need for surgery at one year. Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome or whose symptoms have not improved after four to six months of conservative therapy should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective, but patients return to work an average of one week earlier with endoscopic techniques.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^114AmhKz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The radial nerve (RN) can establish communicating branches with the sensory nerves of the forearm, specifically the medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. It also connects with the median nerve and its branches. The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) contributes to the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve, and the superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) communicates with the palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve.

- **Motor deficits related to radial nerve paralysis**: The typical symptoms depend on the location of the pathology. The symptoms of PIN impairment include disrupted extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb and fingers and the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, a condition referred to as "finger drop". Despite these motor deficits, normal sensation is retained. Paralysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris results in radial deviation of the wrist during extension. Additionally, impairment of wrist extension resulting from RN injury is known as "wrist drop", characterized by weakening of the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi brevis. High radial nerve entrapment (HRNE), linked to neuropathy at levels above the radial groove, can affect the triceps brachii and the anconeus, leading to impairment of elbow extension. Long-term paralysis of the supplied muscles eventually leads to their atrophy.

The RN can be compressed at multiple locations, ranging from its origin at the brachial plexus to the ends of its terminal branches. Knowledge of the anatomy of these entrapments is crucial for establishing a correct diagnosis and implementing appropriate treatment. Most RN neuropathies are related to its main trunk in the arm.

The capacity to dynamically assess the wrist and use the contralateral asymptomatic wrist for comparison purposes are strengths of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. This pictorial review deals with the sonographic assessment of commonly encountered wrist pathologies.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^112Gp2Sk]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Compressive neuropathies of the radial nerve (RN) can present a clinical challenge. Although they are rare, there is a wide range of possible etiologies and regions of the nerve where compression can occur. Radial nerve compression syndromes need to be differentiated from both systemic diseases and local pathologies, such as lateral epicondylitis or cervical radiculopathy, as they may exhibit similar symptoms. Even though most RN injuries have a traumatic etiology, nontraumatic RN injuries represent a significant portion of the neuropathies. Thus, they cannot be neglected in the diagnostic process, and each patient should be evaluated individually. Knowledge of the anatomical variations and contributing factors is important for solving clinical problems.

### Repetitive and forceful movements of the hand as predictors of treatment for pain in the distal upper extremities [^112UPmzb]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A possible bias could have been different care-seeking behavior in job groups or between sexes, for example, because of accessibility or information. However, the population was homogenous regarding educational level, which may have limited this bias. The use of the PDHS was comparable to the use of physical therapy in the general population. According to Statistics Denmark, approximately 6%–8% of the Danish population had at least one treatment with doctor-referred physiotherapy annually in 2008–2018, compared with 5%–7% of the members in the PDHS in the same period. Also, leisure time physical activity was not known and may be an unmeasured confounder; however, previously, its confounding effect on pain outcomes has been minor.

A JEM entails the risk of non-differential misclassification of individual exposure due to variation within groups compared with the variation between groups. The job groups were selected to represent large exposure variation to counteract the effect of such misclassification. Angular velocity was chosen over mean power frequency as the measurement of repetition, as it has been shown to be consistently associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, and elbow disorders. The fewer job groups and a lower absolute number of events might explain the results among the women.

The expert-rated use of force did not take sex into account, which may have caused misclassification. As an example, male and female gardeners had quite different angular velocity but the same level of force in our JEM. This might represent a misclassification, as male gardeners typically…

### Novel adaptations in motor cortical maps: The relation to persistent elbow pain [^116ZTwm4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Unilateral elbow pain results in sensorimotor dysfunction that is frequently bilateral, affects local and remote upper limb muscles, and persists beyond the resolution of local tendon symptoms. These characteristics suggest supraspinal involvement. Here, we investigated the excitability and organization of the M1 representation of the wrist extensor muscles and the relation between M1 changes and clinical outcomes in lateral epicondylalgia (LE) (n = 11) and healthy control subjects (n = 11).

- **Methods**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to map the M1 representation of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor digitorum (ED).

- **Results**: The cortical representations of ECRB and ED were more excitable, and the centers of gravity for the two muscles were located closer together in LE than in healthy controls. Increased ECRB excitability and closer location of the center of gravity were associated with higher pain severity at rest and/or in the preceding 6 months. A novel finding was a reduced number of discrete peaks in the representations of ECRB and ED in participants with LE compared with healthy controls.

- **Conclusions**: This finding may have broad implications for the control of the wrist extensor muscles in LE. These data provide evidence that cortical organization may be maladaptive in LE and suggest that reorganization may be associated with persistence/recurrence of pain.

### Microvascular supply of the lateral epicondyle and common extensor origin [^11444LCD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a common condition affecting 1% to 3% of the population. Although the exact cause is still unknown, numerous theories have been put forth. One theory suggests a hypovascular zone at the origin of the common extensor mass. This study examines the microvascular supply of the lateral epicondyle and the common extensor mass, utilizing India ink injection and the Spalteholz tissue-clearing technique.

Six fresh-frozen cadaveric arms underwent serial sectioning (coronal plane in five and axial plane in one) after vascular injection with India ink. Sections were cleared via a modified Spalteholz technique. Photographs were taken before and after the clearing procedure, and the microvascular pattern of the common extensor mass and lateral epicondyle was described.

Two hypovascular zones were identified in the region of the lateral epicondyle. The first was noted at the proximal lateral epicondyle just distal to the supracondylar ridge, and the second 2 to 3 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle on the deep surface of the common extensor tendon. These hypovascular regions at the lateral epicondyle and within the common extensor origin may preclude the normal inflammatory cascade and healing response to microtearing in this region. Thus, these zones may play a role in the etiology of lateral epicondylitis.

### Healthy pain-free individuals with a history of distal radius fracture demonstrate an expanded distribution of experimental referred pain toward the wrist [^115ACSJ8]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Nociception caused by injuries may sensitize central mechanisms, leading to expanded pain areas. However, the status of such pain distribution and sensitivity mechanisms after recovery is not well understood. This study investigated whether individuals who have fully recovered from a distal radius fracture show increased pain sensitivity and an expanded distribution of pressure-induced pain.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional single-blinded study.

- **Setting**: Clinical setting.

- **Subjects**: Twenty-three pain-free individuals with a history of painful distal radius fracture and 22 nonfractured, age/gender-matched controls participated in two experimental sessions (day 0 and day 1), held 24 hours apart.

- **Methods**: Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured bilaterally at the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), infraspinatus, and gastrocnemius muscles. The spatial distribution of pain was assessed following a 60-second painful pressure stimulation at the ECRL (bilateral) and the infraspinatus muscles on the fractured or dominant side. Participants mapped pain areas on a body map. After day 0 assessments, prolonged pain was induced by eccentric exercise of wrist extensors on the fractured/dominant side.

Results demonstrated that, compared with controls, pressure-induced ECRL pain in the fracture group more frequently referred toward the distal forearm (P < 0.005) on day 0. Both groups showed larger pain areas on day 1 compared with day 0 (P < 0.005), though the fracture group exhibited a more significant relative change between days (P < 0.005). Additionally, the fracture group had larger pain areas on the fracture side compared with the contralateral side.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^111Czef5]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

A detailed interview, including a history of former trauma, is important in cases with suspected WS. The possibility of a bone fragment compressing the SBRN as a result of a Colles fracture is rare but should not be excluded, especially in the distal parts of the forearm where the nerves and bone are in immediate proximity.

Besides pathologies with anatomical or traumatic etiologies, the SBRN can also be compressed by excessive tissue growth. Ganglia constitute 50–70% of all soft tissue tumors in the hand; 60–70% of these arise from the posterior wrist. Their presence in the anatomical snuffbox causes compression. However, they can also be encountered in more proximal parts of the nerve, such as at the elbow. Symptoms can be caused by any kind of tumor close to the nerve, from relatively common ones such as fibromas to the least expected, like dilated lymphatic vessels. Mackinnon and Dellon suggested that because the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the SBRN overlap partially or completely in the posteroradial part of the wrist in 75% of cases, an injury related to the SBRN (such as a neuroma) can be much harder to treat than anywhere else, as the other nerve can be a concomitant, but avoided, source of the pain.

The subcutaneous course of the SBRN makes it prone to iatrogenic injuries during surgeries. External fixator pins used in the management of distal radius fractures are usually located in proximity to the nerve as it travels on the distal radial side of the forearm. The insertion and removal of the Kirschner wire are associated with potential damage.

### Role of magnetic resonance imaging in entrapment and compressive neuropathy — what, where, and how to see the peripheral nerves on the musculoskeletal magnetic resonance image: part 2. Upper extremity [^111BEfeJ]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of nerve entrapment and compressive neuropathy has traditionally been based on clinical and electrodiagnostic examinations. With improvements in the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging modality, MR now plays a fundamental role in detecting space-occupying lesions and serves a compensatory role in clinically and electrodiagnostically inconclusive cases. Although ultrasound has advanced in recent decades and demonstrates high-resolution capabilities, it is limited by its operator dependency.

We review the course of normal peripheral nerves and the various clinical demonstrations and pathological features of compressed and entrapped nerves in the upper extremities on MR imaging, based on the nerves involved. The common sites of nerve entrapment in the upper extremity include:

- **Brachial plexus of the thoracic outlet**: Potential entrapment site.
- **Axillary nerve of the quadrilateral space**: Potential entrapment site.
- **Radial nerve of the radial tunnel**: Potential entrapment site.
- **Ulnar nerve of the cubital tunnel and Guyon's canal**: Potential entrapment sites.
- **Median nerve of the pronator syndrome, anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, and carpal tunnel syndrome**: Potential entrapment sites.

Although MR imaging can effectively depict peripheral nerves in the extremities, radiologists should be familiar with nerve pathways, common sites of nerve compression, and common space-occupying lesions resulting in nerve compression on MR imaging.

### Anomalous radial artery as an incidental finding during a routine carpal tunnel release [^114Ja8Ac]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Compression of the median nerve at the wrist, or carpal tunnel syndrome, is the most commonly recognized nerve entrapment syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by compression of the median nerve due to synovial swelling, tumor, or anomalous anatomical structure within the carpal tunnel.

- **Methods**: During a routine carpal tunnel decompression, a large vessel was identified within the carpal tunnel.

- **Results**: The large vessel was the radial artery. It ran along the radial aspect of the carpal tunnel just adjacent to the median nerve.

- **Conclusions**: The unusual presence of the radial artery within the carpal tunnel could be a contributing factor to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. In this case, after surgical carpal tunnel release, all symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome resolved.

### Repetitive and forceful movements of the hand as predictors of treatment for pain in the distal upper extremities [^1168jHsC]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

It is paramount to separate measures of exposure from outcome in a prospective design to draw causal conclusions. However, obtaining enough statistical power can be difficult when objectively measured exposures and outcomes are used. Often, registers will ensure the objective outcomes, but not when examining temporally fluctuating and under-reported diseases and conditions such as epicondylitis and hand or wrist tendinitis. In that case, close monitoring and follow-up are needed, and this is costly and time-consuming.

Quantitative measurements for the exposure can be obtained by direct observation, self-report, or technical measurements. Register information on job title and industry and measurements of job-related exposures can be combined in a job exposure matrix (JEM). This separates exposure and outcome and enables the formation of large cohorts that can be followed for a long period of time. Using this method in the Danish registers, an exposure-response effect of increasing wrist angular velocity on carpal tunnel syndrome has been found, but associations with force and combinations of force and repetition could not be examined due to the lack of available force measurements. Expert-rated force has been used recently in JEMs and may allow for investigation into combinations of force and repetition.

In parallel with the public treatments of diseases, private sector health programmes have emerged that offer treatments for musculoskeletal pain. Using such a health scheme as an outcome measure, where access to treatment is easily available and not dependent on a doctor's referral, may.

### Radial tunnel syndrome: Review and best evidence [^117Bf7ZX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Radial tunnel syndrome (RTS) is caused by compression of the posterior interosseous nerve and consists of a constellation of symptoms that have previously been characterized as aspects of other disease processes, as opposed to a distinct diagnosis. First described in the mid-20th century as "radial pronator syndrome", knowledge regarding the anatomy and presentation of RTS has advanced markedly over the past several decades. However, there remains notable controversy and ongoing research regarding diagnostic imaging, nonsurgical treatment options, and indications for surgical intervention.

In this review, we will discuss the anatomic considerations of RTS, relevant physical examination findings, potential diagnostic modalities, and outcomes of several treatment options.

### Lateral epicondylitis: Review and current concepts [^115rbi49]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a painful and functionally limiting condition affecting the upper extremity and is frequently treated by hand surgeons. The anatomic basis of the injury to the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin appears multifaceted, involving hypovascular zones, eccentric tendon stresses, and a microscopic degenerative response. Although many treatments have been advocated, there is little clear consensus on which modality works best, for both conservative and operative options. This article presents an overview of this difficult problem and provides an evidence-based review of treatment choices.

### Radial nerve compression: Anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^116GWVFs]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

When there is pain, swelling, and tenderness along the course of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) at two distinct locations, double-level entrapment should be considered. Sponseller and Engber reported a case with the PIN compressed at both the level of the arcade of Frohse (AF) and the distal border of the supinator muscle. Yongwei et al. presented three cases of nontraumatic PIN compression with a suspected inflammatory etiology. In four cases described by Kotani et al, all the PIN constrictions were between the division of the supinator motor branch from the main trunk of the nerve and the AF. The characteristic features of more severe lesions were adhesions that induced abnormal nerve rotation. In a case described by Lin et al, there was compression at two locations, the lateral head (LH) and the AF. Casal et al. reported entrapment in the same locations as Lin et al. but there was also a spontaneous rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon.

The differential diagnosis, apart from ganglia and aneurysm of the radial collateral artery or traumatic etiologies such as fractures or rupture of the extensor tendons, should also consider complications of systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, serum sickness, alcohol abuse, or lead or arsenic intoxication. Identifying such factors can be helpful, especially when there is no clear external compressing factor.

Surgery is suggested as the primary treatment for PIN palsy only when MRI and sometimes ultrasonography (USG) have confirmed lesions that directly compress the nerve, or when the symptoms are very severe. In other cases, conservative treatment should be considered.

### Compound muscle action potential amplitude predicts the severity of cubital tunnel syndrome [^115d4yyp]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2019). Low credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome has a spectrum of presentations ranging from mild paresthesias to debilitating numbness and intrinsic atrophy. Commonly, the classification of severity relies on clinical symptoms and slowing of conduction velocity across the elbow. However, changes in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude more accurately reflect axonal loss. We hypothesized that CMAP amplitude would better predict functional impairment than conduction velocity alone.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort of patients who underwent a surgical procedure for cubital tunnel syndrome over a 5-year period were included in the study. All patients had electrodiagnostic testing performed at our institution. Clinical and electrodiagnostic variables were recorded. The primary outcome was preoperative functional impairment, defined by grip and key pinch strength ratios. Multivariable regression identified which clinical and electrodiagnostic variables predicted preoperative functional impairment.

- **Results**: Eighty-three patients with a mean age of 57 years (75% male) were included in the study. The majority of patients (88%) had abnormal electrodiagnostic studies. Fifty-four percent had reduced CMAP amplitude, and 79% had slowing of conduction velocity across the elbow (recorded from the first dorsal interosseous). On bivariate analysis, older age and longer symptom duration were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with reduced CMAP amplitude and slowing of conduction velocity across the elbow, whereas body mass index (BMI), laterality, a primary surgical procedure compared with…

### Proximal median nerve compression: Pronator syndrome [^115hvThH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Pronator syndrome (PS) is a compressive neuropathy of the median nerve in the proximal forearm, with symptoms that often overlap with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Because electrodiagnostic studies are often negative in PS, making the correct diagnosis can be challenging. All patients should be initially managed with nonsurgical treatment, but surgical intervention has been shown to result in satisfactory outcomes. Several surgical techniques have been described, with most outcomes data based on retrospective case series. It is essential for clinicians to have a thorough understanding of median nerve anatomy, possible sites of compression, and characteristic clinical findings of PS to provide a reliable diagnosis and treat their patients.

### Tendinopathies of the hand and wrist [^117LUfqj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Tendinopathies involving the hand and wrist are common. Many are diagnosed easily, and in many cases, the management is straightforward, provided the pathology and principles are understood. Common conditions involving the tendons of the hand and wrist include trigger finger, tenosynovitis of the first through sixth dorsal extensor compartments, and flexor carpi radialis tendonitis. Management strategies include nonsurgical treatments, such as splinting, injection, or therapy, and surgical techniques such as tendon release.

### Distal radius fracture - Supination underestimates dorsal tilt in distal radius fracture radiographs: A case report [^112befQD]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The overall objective of this report was to highlight the importance of correct forearm positioning when obtaining lateral radiographs of the wrist. Our case illustrates the importance of obtaining a true lateral radiograph when assessing dorsal tilt, which may be important when determining the treatment method and is equally important in follow-up imaging where radiographs obtained with opposing forearm rotation may mimic fracture instability.

We illustrated the need for a consensus on true lateral radiographs using reliable anatomical structures as proposed by Yang et al. instead of other typically used methods such as distal radioulnar overlap. Moreover, several studies have reported that inter-observer agreement in measuring dorsal tilt is generally moderate and can be further affected by factors such as forearm positioning — particularly the degree of supination or pronation from the neutral axis — as well as the experience level of the observers. We also suggest consensus in obtaining measurements systematically, such as proposed by Kreder et al. This case could potentially benefit all readers regardless of their experience level, and since dorsal tilt is used in some national guidelines, it could help in distinguishing between fractures requiring surgical intervention or conservative treatment.

One might speculate that there are some limitations in this field of study, such as limited research on quantitative measurements of distal radius fractures with intraarticular involvement, simultaneous carpal instability, ligament injury, or in-depth analysis of these conditions.

### Pediatric ulnar-sided wrist pain: A review of the current literature [^115eeKuP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with ulnar-sided wrist pain can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to physicians because several pathologies present with similar signs and symptoms. Compared to adult patients, additional etiologies must be considered in pediatric patients due to skeletal immaturity and the potential for known or unrecognized syndromes. These patients may not articulate their symptoms as clearly as adults, underscoring the importance of obtaining a pertinent history and performing a focused physical examination. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, varying pathologies, and indications for surgical and nonsurgical management will aid in improving patient outcomes.

### Current approach to radial nerve paralysis [^1117Edbe]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

After studying this article, the participant should be able to achieve several objectives:

1. Identify all potential points of radial nerve compression and other likely causes of radial nerve injury.
2. Accurately diagnose both surgical and nonsurgical causes of radial nerve paralysis.
3. Define a safe and effective approach to the surgical release and reconstruction of the radial nerve.

Radial nerve paralysis, which can result from complex humerus fracture, direct nerve trauma, compressive neuropathies, neuritis, or (rarely) malignant tumor formation, has been reported throughout the literature, with some controversy regarding its diagnosis and management. The appropriate management of any radial nerve palsy depends primarily on an accurate determination of its cause, severity, duration, and level of involvement. The radial nerve can be injured as proximally as the brachial plexus or as distally as the posterior interosseous or radial sensory nerve. This article reviews the etiology, prognosis, and various treatments available for radial nerve paralysis. It also provides a new classification system and treatment algorithm to assist in the management of patients with radial nerve palsies, and it offers a simple, five-step approach to radial nerve release in the forearm.

### Management of lateral epicondylosis [^113GMVy9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylosis is a common cause of lateral elbow pain and can lead to disability and overall diminished quality of life. Repetitive gripping and wrist extension are thought to lead to microtearing and degeneration of the extensor tendons. In general, patients with symptoms of lateral epicondylosis experience relief with non-operative management alone. However, controversy remains concerning the role of non-surgical management and which modality facilitates the quickest recovery. Moreover, debate exists throughout the literature regarding surgical intervention and other treatment options for refractory cases. This article provides an updated review of the various treatment options and management strategies for treating lateral epicondylosis.

### Radial nerve compression: Anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^115duoKe]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The radial nerve is the largest branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and one of its five terminal branches. Entrapment of the radial nerve at the elbow is the third most common compressive neuropathy of the upper limb, following carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes. Because the incidence is relatively low and many agents can compress it along its entire course, entrapment of the radial nerve or its branches can pose a considerable clinical challenge. Several of these agents are related to normal or variant anatomy. The most common of the compressive neuropathies related to the radial nerve is the posterior interosseous nerve syndrome. Appropriate treatment requires familiarity with the anatomical traits influencing the presenting symptoms and the related prognoses. The aim of this study is to describe the compressive neuropathies of the radial nerve, emphasizing the anatomical perspective and highlighting the traps awaiting physicians evaluating these entrapments.

### Author response to commentary on "Posterior interosseous nerve compression in the forearm, AKA radial tunnel syndrome: A clinical diagnosis" [^112qoUeu]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

We would like to thank Dr. Hagart for her thoughtful comments on our study, "Posterior Interosseous Nerve Compression in the Forearm, AKA Radial Tunnel Syndrome: A Clinical Diagnosis". Her comments primarily address two facets of our study: our description of posterior interosseous nerve compression in the forearm (PINCF) as presenting with pain and without motor paralysis, and our exclusion of patients with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis.

Posterior interosseous nerve compression in the forearm is an uncommon diagnosis made by careful and thorough history-taking and physical examination. Patients with PINCF present with pain in the proximal forearm in the interval between the brachioradialis (BR) and extensor carpi radialis/brevis (ECRL/ECRB), 3 to 5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle. Our patient population did not have objective evidence of weakness. While we agree with Dr. Hagart that there is subtlety in the measurement of M4 muscle weakness, the primary presenting complaint and exam finding in this patient population is pain, both with direct palpation and provocative maneuvers. We believe this is the most useful clinical finding in this challenging patient population. We appreciate the technical aspects of evaluating extensor carpi ulnaris muscle weakness described by Dr. Hagart and highlighted in her commentary, and we plan to incorporate this into our evaluation of these patients in the future.

We do not believe that the majority of patients with PINCF have concomitant lateral epicondylitis. The incidence of concomitant…

### The effect of multiplanar distal radius fractures on forearm rotation: In vitro biomechanical study [^116uthVJ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients develop distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) pain and loss of forearm rotation after distal radial fractures. Residual distal radial deformity is one potential cause of DRUJ dysfunction; however, the parameters of distal radial fracture alignment that lead to an acceptable functional outcome are poorly defined in the literature.

- **Methods**: We used 8 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens in this in vitro study to examine the effect of simulated distal radius fracture misalignment on forearm rotation. A distal radial osteotomy was performed just proximal to the DRUJ, and a custom-made, 3-degrees-of-freedom modular implant designed to simulate distal radius fracture deformities was secured in place. This allowed for accurate simulation of dorsal angulation, dorsal translation, and radial shortening, both independently and in combination. We examined the effects of distal radius deformity in the setting of both an intact and sectioned triangular fibrocartilage complex.

- **Results**: Pronation was not significantly affected until dorsal angulation reached 30 degrees. Dorsal translation of up to 10 mm or radial shortening up to 5 mm had no effect on forearm rotation. Combined deformities had a greater effect on forearm motion than isolated malpositions. Dorsal angulation of ≥ 20 degrees combined with 10 mm of dorsal translation or 20 degrees of angulation with 2.5 mm of radial shortening resulted in a significant decrease in forearm pronation. There was no effect of distal radial deformities, either isolated or combined, on the magnitude of forearm rotation after sectioning.

### Evaluation and diagnosis of wrist pain: A case-based approach [^113XJ29N]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with wrist pain commonly present with an acute injury or spontaneous onset of pain without a definite traumatic event. A fall onto an outstretched hand can lead to a scaphoid fracture, which is the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Conventional radiography alone can miss up to 30 percent of scaphoid fractures. Specialized views (e.g. posteroanterior in ulnar deviation, pronated oblique) and repeat radiography in 10 to 14 days can improve sensitivity for scaphoid fractures. If a suspected scaphoid fracture cannot be confirmed with plain radiography, a bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging can be used.

Subacute or chronic wrist pain usually develops gradually with or without a prior traumatic event. In these cases, the differential diagnosis is wide and includes tendinopathy and nerve entrapment. Overuse of the muscles of the forearm and wrist may lead to tendinopathy. Radial pain involving mostly the first extensor compartment is commonly de Quervain tenosynovitis. The diagnosis is based on history and examination findings of a positive Finkelstein test and a negative grind test.

Nerve entrapment at the wrist presents with pain and also with sensory and sometimes motor symptoms. In ulnar neuropathies of the wrist, the typical presentation is wrist discomfort with sensory changes in the fourth and fifth digits. Activities that involve repetitive or prolonged wrist extension, such as cycling, karate, and baseball (specifically catchers), may increase the risk of ulnar neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic tests identify the area of nerve entrapment and the extent of the condition.

### Posterior interosseous neuropathy: Supinator syndrome vs fascicular radial neuropathy [^1129dfNh]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The study followed standard protocol approvals, registrations, and obtained patient consents. Approval was granted by the institutional ethics committee (S-398/2012), and all participants provided written informed consent.

- **Clinical and demographic patient data**: Patients included in the study were referred to our department with a clinical diagnosis of posterior interosseous neuropathy syndrome (PINS) due to muscle weakness and abnormal EMG results in the distribution of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). Specific muscles impacted included the extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, extensor carpi ulnaris, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor indicis.

Patients exhibiting motor weakness involving more proximal muscles, such as the triceps brachii muscle, brachioradialis, or extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, or those with EMG evidence of denervation in these muscles, were excluded. Additionally, patients with sensory deficits, especially in the distribution of the superficial sensory radial nerve, were excluded. Patients with nerve root compression (C6-C8) on cervical spine imaging were also excluded.

Overall, 28 patients (13 women, 15 men, mean age 48.5 ± 15.5 years) met the inclusion criteria and were examined at the Department of Neuroradiology of Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany between January 2010 and December 2015. Of these 28 patients, 9 were subsequently excluded following a detailed review of their history and electrophysiologic reports revealed findings indicative of a neuropathy other than a compression neuropathy at the level of the supinator muscle. This included 4 patients with additional sensory radial nerve symptoms and 4 with more proximal muscle paresis or EMG.

### Surgical exposures of the radius and ulna [^1136LvC1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

The forearm contains many muscles, nerves, and vascular structures that change position on forearm rotation. Exposure of the radial shaft is best achieved with the Henry (volar) or Thompson (dorsal) approach. The volar flexor carpi radialis approaches are used increasingly for exposure of the distal radius. Although the dorsal approach is a safe, utilitarian option with many applications, its use for managing fractures of the distal radius has waned. Potential complications associated with radial exposure include injury to the superficial branch of the radial nerve, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, and the cephalic vein. Dorsal and ulnar proximal radial exposures are associated with an increased risk of injury to the posterior interosseous nerve. With surgical exposure of the ulna, care is required to avoid injuring the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of dorsoradial hand and forearm pain [^113VCtVs]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Dorsoradial forearm and hand pain was historically considered difficult to treat surgically due to a particular susceptibility of the radial sensory nerve (RSN) to injury and/or compression. A nerve block, if it were done at all, was directed at the region of the anatomic snuff box to block the RSN in an effort to provide diagnostic information as to the pain etiology. Even for patients with pain relief following a diagnostic block, resecting the RSN often proved unsuccessful in fully relieving pain.

The solution to successful treatment of this refractory pain problem was the realization that the RSN is not the sole source of sensory innervation to the dorsoradial wrist. In fact, in 75% of people, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LABCN) dermatome overlaps the RSN with other nerves, such as the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve and even the posterior antebrachial cutaneous nerves, occasionally providing sensory innervation to the same area.

With this more refined understanding of the cutaneous neuroanatomy of the wrist, the diagnostic nerve block algorithm was expanded to include selective blockage of more than just the RSN. In contemporary practice, identification of the exact nerves responsible for pain signal generation informs surgical decision-making for palliative neurolysis or neurectomy. This approach offers a systematic and repeatable method to inform the diagnosis and treatment of dorsoradial forearm and wrist pain.

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^1116QQao]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy worldwide. It results from the compression of the median nerve in the narrow passage from the forearm to the hand, constituted by the flexor retinaculum and bones of the wrist. CTS has a prevalence of 50 cases per 1,000 people, with a female predominance and onset in the fifth or sixth decade. The diagnosis of CTS is based on the clinical presentation of relevant symptoms and is supported by electrophysiological findings due to the entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. The hallmark of the electrophysiological diagnosis is distal motor latency (DML) prolongation, coupled with sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) slowing, or the absence of sensory action potential (SAP).

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is the most common acquired chronic inflammatory neuropathy, with its prevalence ranging from 0.8 to 8.9 cases per 100,000 people. The diagnosis of CIDP relies on clinical signs and symptoms confirmed by electrophysiological tests demonstrating peripheral nerve demyelination, according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria. Supportive criteria can assist in the diagnosis.

DML prolongation ≥ 50% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is a major EFNS/PNS electrophysiological criterion for diagnosing CIDP. However, compression or entrapment itself (e.g. CTS) can manifest demyelinating features and result in DML prolongation fulfilling EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria. Accordingly, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the possibility of such compressions in the diagnostic process.

### Imaging of elbow entrapment neuropathies [^112HHudK]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Entrapment neuropathies at the elbow are common in clinical practice and require an accurate diagnosis for effective management. Understanding the imaging characteristics of these conditions is essential for confirming diagnoses and identifying underlying causes. Ultrasound serves as the primary imaging modality for evaluating nerve structure and movement, while MRI is superior for detecting muscle denervation. Plain radiography and CT play a minor role and can be used for the evaluation of bony structures and calcifications/ossifications. Comprehensive knowledge of anatomical landmarks, nerve pathways, and compression sites is crucial for clinicians to accurately interpret imaging and guide appropriate treatment strategies for entrapments of ulnar, median, and radial nerves, and their branches.

- **Critical relevance statement**: Accurate imaging and anatomical knowledge are essential for diagnosing elbow entrapment neuropathies. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for assessing nerve structure and motion, while MRI excels in detecting muscle denervation and guiding effective management of ulnar, median, and radial nerve entrapments.

- **Key points**:
	- Ultrasound is the primary modality for assessing nerve structure and stability. Findings include nerve structural loss, isoechogenicity, thickening, and hyper-vascularization.
	- MRI provides a comprehensive evaluation of the elbow and accurate muscle assessment.
	- Imaging allows the identification of compressive causes, including anatomical variants, masses, or osseous anomalies.
	- Awareness of anatomical landmarks and nerve pathways is essential for diagnosis.
