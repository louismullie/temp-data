## Question

How to handle a patient with probably heart failure exacerbation but is dehydrated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient with probable heart failure exacerbation and concurrent dehydration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. Then, I should verify the diagnosis and the hemodynamic profile, especially congestion versus perfusion. Next, I will weigh the paradox of dehydration with volume overload and outline a careful fluid and diuretic strategy. After that, I need to plan diuretic titration and response monitoring, address diuretic resistance, manage electrolytes and hyponatremia, optimize guideline-directed medical therapy, and prepare discharge with follow-up. Finally, I will double-check safety considerations and edge cases to ensure nothing is missed.

> Let me first confirm hemodynamic stability because everything else hinges on that; I should check for signs of shock such as persistent hypotension, narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, or elevated lactate, and if present, I need to consider immediate inotropes or vasopressors and involve advanced heart failure teams for possible mechanical support rather than starting with aggressive diuresis [^111xdtrT] [^116FSMAH] [^115NH1Vx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about heart failure until I verify the diagnosis; I need to check natriuretic peptides and correlate with history, exam, chest radiography, and, if available, bedside ultrasound to distinguish intravascular from tissue congestion, because BNP or NT-proBNP help in ambiguous presentations and help grade congestion severity even if I cannot fully separate HFpEF from HFrEF acutely [^111xdtrT] [^1152TpUS] [^114cwcEq].

> Next, I should review the hemodynamic profile; wait, let me verify congestion and perfusion separately, using JVP, orthopnea, rales, edema, and lung ultrasound for congestion, and skin temperature, mentation, pulse pressure, and lactate for perfusion, because misclassifying "wet" versus "dry" will misdirect therapy in a patient who appears dehydrated yet has volume overload on exam or imaging [^113VbQJu] [^111xdtrT] [^115mQzwM].

> I will now examine the paradox of dehydration with congestion; hmm, wait a minute, dehydration here often reflects a reduction in effective arterial blood volume from neurohormonal vasoconstriction and redistribution despite total body sodium and water excess, so the patient can be intravascularly "dry" with interstitial edema, and I should also check for hypoalbuminemia because it amplifies edema and predisposes to over-diuresis with renal injury, and I need to check albumin on admission to inform caution with diuretic intensity [^112VU6Aw] [^1152TpUS].

> Now, for initial fluid strategy, I initially thought "no fluids", but hold on, I should verify perfusion first; if there is hypoperfusion or systolic BP less than about 90 mmHg, a cautious small bolus of 250–500 mL crystalloid can be reasonable while monitoring JVP, lungs, and blood pressure, whereas in normotensive patients with clear congestion, fluids are generally withheld and diuresis prioritized to avoid worsening pulmonary edema [^115NH1Vx] [^11712kA5].

> For diuretic therapy, I need to ensure early, adequately dosed intravenous loop diuretics; if the patient was on oral furosemide, I should convert to IV at 1–2.5 times the total daily oral dose, and if naïve to loop diuretics, starting around 40–80 mg IV daily is reasonable, then titrate based on urine output and clinical response while monitoring renal function and electrolytes, and I should double-check that this aligns with DOSE-based practice and guideline pathways [^114DeRrU] [^113Z49sd] [^11712kA5].

> Wait, let me verify diuretic resistance early; checking spot urine sodium 2 hours after dosing helps me gauge natriuretic response, and if sodium is less than about 50–70 mEq/L, I should escalate the loop dose or add a thiazide for sequential nephron blockade, recognizing the trade-offs in electrolytes and renal function, and I should confirm daily weight loss of roughly 0.5–1.0 kg in stable patients to track progress without overshooting [^111WLHZC] [^111MGtVU] [^115VanS5].

> I need to check for electrolyte disturbances every day with IV diuretics; let me ensure I'm supplementing potassium aggressively and consider chloride repletion to mitigate diuretic-induced hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and I should be cautious with hyponatremia — fluid restriction is only selectively useful and may worsen thirst without clear outcome benefit, so I will treat the underlying congestion first and reserve fluid restriction for select cases like advanced hyponatremic HF or SIADH-like physiology, and I should double-check sodium trends to avoid overly rapid correction [^111aocJJ] [^111dSeUs] [^114hmeK4].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed medical therapy; once the patient is euvolemic and hemodynamically stable, I need to initiate or up-titrate ARNI or ACEI or ARB, beta-blocker, and MRA as tolerated, and I should confirm renal function and potassium before and after MRA initiation and at intervals, and I need to remember that SGLT2 inhibitors can be started during hospitalization but may necessitate diuretic adjustment due to osmotic diuresis, so I should plan for that at discharge [^116BxYP3] [^116qj6g9] [^116HAUpi].

> But wait, what if congestion persists despite high-dose loop therapy; I should consider acetazolamide as an adjunct to enhance natriuresis, and if still refractory, I should verify candidacy for ultrafiltration, keeping in mind that CARESS-HF did not show superiority of routine ultrafiltration over stepped diuretic strategies and that catheter-related adverse events can occur, so I will reserve ultrafiltration for diuretic-refractory cases with careful renal monitoring [^116b8tx7] [^111vwuTT] [^112z6NhT].

> I should double-check discharge readiness; the patient should be near euvolemia with stable weight, no orthopnea or JVD, and a safe diuretic plan, and I need to ensure a discharge diuretic regimen that matches the effective inpatient dose, because stopping IV diuretics prematurely and restarting later is associated with worse early outcomes, and I must provide clear weight-based diuretic titration instructions and arrange close follow-up within 7 days [^116qj6g9] [^117BrZXK] [^11712kA5].

> For outpatient and transitional care, I need to ensure daily weights, strict sodium restriction to about 2 g per day, and selective fluid restriction only if hyponatremia or symptoms persist, and I should confirm that the patient understands symptom triggers and has a medication reconciliation plan, because structured education and early follow-up reduce readmissions and improve adherence [^117BrZXK] [^111dSeUs] [^11128zrK].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and edge cases; I need to avoid or stop NSAIDs and thiazolidinediones that worsen sodium retention or precipitate HF, I should consider thiamine supplementation in patients on chronic high-dose loop diuretics given the risk of deficiency, and I must monitor for lactic acidosis risk if metformin is used in the setting of dehydration or acute HF, adjusting therapy accordingly [^117H1t7w] [^116bJED9] [^112vzC65] [^1177eiML].

> In summary, I need to ensure a careful balance: treat the congestion with appropriately dosed IV loop diuretics and escalation strategies, correct perfusion issues cautiously if present, avoid routine fluid loading in congested patients, monitor renal function and electrolytes daily, and advance GDMT promptly once stable, because the key is to relieve congestion without provoking renal injury or hypotension in a patient who is paradoxically dehydrated yet volume overloaded [^11712kA5] [^1174Nggp] [^111MGtVU].

---

For a patient with probable heart failure exacerbation and dehydration, prioritize **IV loop diuretics** [^111MGtVU] to relieve congestion while monitoring renal function and electrolytes closely [^111aocJJ]. Use **small, cautious fluid boluses** only if hypotension or low perfusion is present, and avoid routine fluid loading [^115NH1Vx]. Adjust diuretic dose to prevent over-diuresis, and consider adding a thiazide if resistance occurs [^1151Ln3a]. Reassess volume status frequently, and transition to oral diuretics once euvolemia is achieved [^11712kA5].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Evaluate congestion and perfusion to guide therapy [^1174Nggp].
- **Volume status**: Monitor daily weight, JVP, peripheral edema, and orthopnea [^1136cDWr].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check daily electrolytes, renal function, and acid-base status during active diuresis [^111aocJJ].
- **Orthostatic vitals**: Track blood pressure and heart rate changes to detect hypovolemia [^114vcvws].

---

## Fluid management strategy

### Diuretic therapy

- **IV loop diuretics**: First-line for congestion; start at 1–2.5× the oral dose (furosemide 40–80 mg IV) and titrate to effect [^114DeRrU] [^111MGtVU].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for over-diuresis, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances [^111aocJJ].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Add thiazide (e.g. metolazone) if loop diuretic resistance occurs [^1151Ln3a] [^111LWoyh].

---

### Fluid administration

Use **cautious fluid boluses** only for hypotension or low perfusion, and avoid routine fluid loading to prevent worsening congestion [^115NH1Vx]. Reassess frequently to avoid both dehydration and fluid overload.

---

## Electrolyte and renal function management

- **Electrolyte replacement**: Replace potassium, magnesium, and sodium as needed to prevent arrhythmias and renal dysfunction [^117H1t7w].
- **Renal function**: Monitor closely; adjust diuretics if creatinine rises > 30% from baseline [^11712kA5].
- **Hyponatremia**: Manage based on volume status; fluid restriction is reasonable in hypervolemic hyponatremia [^114SfmaG] [^114hmeK4].

---

## Transition to outpatient care

Transition planning should include **oral diuretics** at discharge with clear titration instructions [^11712kA5]. Educate on daily weights, sodium restriction, and symptom recognition [^117BrZXK], and arrange close follow-up to monitor stability and adherence [^113qBeiy].

---

## Management approach

| **Clinical priority** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Congestion relief | IV loop diuretics (1–2.5× oral dose) [^114DeRrU] |
| Hypotension/low perfusion | Small, cautious fluid boluses only if indicated [^115NH1Vx] |
| Diuretic resistance | Add thiazide (metolazone) [^1151Ln3a] |
| Electrolyte imbalance | Replace potassium, magnesium, sodium [^notfound] |
| Renal dysfunction | Adjust diuretics; monitor creatinine [^11712kA5] |
| Transition care | Oral diuretics, patient education, close follow-up [^117BrZXK] |

---

Management centers on **careful diuresis** with vigilant monitoring to balance congestion relief against dehydration risk, using adjuncts and education to stabilize and transition safely.

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND LACTIC ACIDOSIS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning

Congestive Heart Failure

- Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients. (5.1)
- After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered. (5.1)
- Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure.
- Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. (4, 5.1)

Lactic Acidosis

- Lactic acidosis can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and acute congestive heart failure. (5.2)
- Symptoms include malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate. (5.2)

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — general measures for patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure: Moderate sodium restriction with daily weight measurement is indicated to permit effective use of diuretic drugs, and immunization with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce respiratory infection risk; physical activity should be encouraged except during acute exacerbations or suspected myocarditis. Three classes of drugs can exacerbate HF and should be avoided in most patients — antiarrhythmic agents (with only amiodarone and dofetilide shown not to adversely affect survival), calcium channel blockers (with only the vasoselective ones shown not to adversely affect survival), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause sodium retention, peripheral vasoconstriction, and attenuate the efficacy and enhance the toxicity of diuretics and ACEIs. Patients with HF should be monitored carefully for changes in serum potassium, every effort should be made to prevent hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, and many experts believe serum potassium concentrations should be targeted in the 4.0 to 5.0 mmol per liter range; in some patients deficits may require supplementation of magnesium and potassium, whereas in others (particularly those taking ACEIs alone or with aldosterone antagonists) routine potassium salts may be unnecessary and potentially deleterious. Patient education and close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, can reduce nonadherence and enable early detection of changes in body weight or clinical status to allow treatments that can prevent clinical deterioration.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

Current guidelines and evidence

Air travel: There is an increased incidence of CV events during travel for persons who have existing CV disease, 76 with cardiac causes representing 8% of medical emergencies during air travel. 77 Among cruise ship passengers, HF decompensation represents approximately 4% of CV emergencies. 78 Moreover, patients with HF are at higher risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli during long haul flights. 79, 80
Passengers with stable HF, without recent changes in symptoms or medications, are usually able to tolerate air travel and the associated mild hypoxia. 79, 81, 82
For patients with stable HF including NYHA class III and IV, hypoxia up to 1 h at rest produces no significant deleterious effects. 81, 83 Take care of pulmonary hypertension, even if the NYHA class is low. Periods of up to 7 h (long haul) are tolerated by those with mild to moderate stable HF (NYHA class II). 84 Severe decompensated HF poses serious challenges to air travel. 85
Change in climate: Colder climates can increase peripheral vascular resistance and thereby increase myocardial oxygen demand, making it easier to reach the ischaemic threshold resulting in and worsening anginal symptoms for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. 6
Altitude: Depending on NYHA class, patients may safely reach high altitude of up to 3500 m (NYHA class I–II) or 3000 m (NYHA class III). Being at high altitude, no greater intensity than moderate physical activity is recommended. It is prudent not to exceed an ascent rate of that recommended for healthy travellers (300–500 m/day when above 2500 m). 86
Stay abroad: Travel also may be associated with a change in lifestyle related to food and alcohol intake and diuretic dose may need adjustment to avoid decompensation.
Gastro‐intestinal upset is quite common when a patient is exposed to alien bacterial flora, which, coupled with sweating in hot climate, may cause dehydration. A practical individualized advice might include to reduce or stop diuretics, drink an additional 500–1000 mL of non‐alcoholic drinks and if the body weight is back to normal the patient can restart the usual medicines. Some patients might even be advised in case of weight loss and/or symptomatic hypotension, to temporary reduce the doses of the diuretics and/or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors.
Driving: The Driving Licence Committee of the European Union amended its Directive 2016/1106 of 7 July 2016 87 and states that driving licences may be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers in NYHA class I, II, III (if stable) for motor cycles, passenger cars and other small vehicles with or without a trailer (group 1). Driving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers in NYHA class IV. Related to professional driving or heavy vehicles [vehicles over 3.5 t or vehicles designed for the carriage of more than nine passengers (including the driver)] (group 2), drivers in NYHA class I and II, driving licences may be issued or renewed provided that the LV ejection fraction is at least 35%. Driving licences shall not be issued for professional driving or heavy vehicles to NYHA class III and IV. Other conditions such as syncope, arrhythmia and treatment should be considered.

Dehydration-related syncope — salt and fluid repletion states that in selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake. In patients with dehydration, sodium supplementation improves plasma volume and improves orthostatic tolerance, and additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages; higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages. This treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

Nonpharmacological management — fluid restriction for hyponatremia in advanced heart failure carries a Class of Recommendation 2b and Level of Evidence C-LD: For patients with advanced HF and hyponatremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce congestive symptoms is uncertain. Supportive text notes that in a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decompensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hyponatremia marginally; a registered dietitian–guided fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were not in stage D HF, and fluid restriction improved quality of life (QOL) in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with HFrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (NYHA class I to IV); however, in a meta-analysis of RCTs, restricted fluid intake compared with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum creatinine, or serum sodium levels, and the validity of a prior trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid restriction is in serious question.

### Hyponatremia in acute decompensated heart failure: mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options [^115nAJLj]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common and is increasingly recognized as an independent prognostic marker that adversely affects morbidity and mortality in various disease states, including heart failure. In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the degree of hyponatremia often parallels the severity of cardiac dysfunction and is further exacerbated by any reduction in glomerular filtration rate and arginine vasopressin dysregulation. A recent study showed that even modest improvement of hyponatremia may have survival benefits. Although management of hyponatremia in ADHF has traditionally focused on improving cardiac function and fluid restriction, the magnitude of improvement of serum sodium is fairly slow and unpredictable. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of hyponatremia in ADHF, review its evolving prognostic significance, and evaluate the efficacy of various treatments for hyponatremia, including the recently approved vasopressin receptor antagonists for managing hyponatremia among patients hospitalized for ADHF.

Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) — hospitalization is a sentinel event that signals worse prognosis and the need to restore hemodynamic compensation but also provides key opportunities to redirect the disease trajectory. During the HF hospitalization, the approach to management should include and address precipitating factors, comorbidities, and previous limitations to ongoing disease management related to social determinants of health, and patients require assessment and management of ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitating factors and comorbidities. The presenting profile, reversible factors, appropriate work-up for cause of HF including ischemic and nonischemic causes, comorbidities, disease trajectory, and goals of care should be addressed. Establishment of optimal volume status is a major goal, and patients with residual congestion merit careful consideration for further intervention before and after discharge, because they face higher risk for rehospitalization and death. The disease trajectory for patients hospitalized with reduced EF is markedly improved by optimization of recommended medical therapies, which should be initiated or increased toward target doses once the efficacy of diuresis has been shown.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to management of HFpEF, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to treat stable patients with HFpEF and acute signs of fluid overload with loop diuretics and manage them in the outpatient setting with close follow-up. Refer unstable patients for emergency care, and admit those with cardiogenic shock and severe hemodynamic instability to intensive care.

### Management of heart failure in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review of the literature [^115NH1Vx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to tailor treatments to the appropriate type of heart failure.

Objectives

This review provides an evidence-based summary of the current ED management of acute heart failure.

Discussion

Heart failure can present along a spectrum, especially in acute exacerbation. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease process, with guidelines focusing primarily on blood pressure and hemodynamic status. Treatment of patients with mild AHF exacerbations often focuses on intravenous diuretics. Patients with AHF with flash pulmonary edema should receive nitroglycerin and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, with consideration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, while monitoring for hypotension. Patients with hypotensive AHF should receive emergent specialty consultation and an initial fluid bolus of 250–500 mL, followed by initiation of inotropic agents with or without vasopressors. Dobutamine is the inotrope of choice in these patients, with norepinephrine recommended if blood pressure support is needed. If noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is required, providers should monitor closely for acute decompensation. Mechanical circulatory support devices may be considered as a bridge to further therapeutic intervention. High-output heart failure can be managed acutely with vasoconstricting agents, with focus on treating the underlying etiology. Disposition is not always straightforward, and several risk scores may assist in this decision.

Conclusion

AHF is a condition that requires rapid assessment and management. Understanding the appropriate management strategy can allow for more targeted treatment and improved outcomes.

Digoxin in acute decompensation and conduction disease — contraindications and cautions specify that digoxin is not indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with an acute exacerbation of HF symptoms, including fluid retention or hypotension, and such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF (usually with intravenous medications); therapy with digoxin may be initiated after stabilization as part of an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. Patients should not be given digoxin if they have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been addressed with a permanent pacemaker, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients taking other drugs that can depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function or affect digoxin levels (e.g., amiodarone or a beta-blocker).

Metformin hydrochloride: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, renal impairment, and acute congestive heart failure. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]
Symptoms include malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap and elevated blood lactate. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]
If acidosis is suspected, discontinue AVANDAMET and hospitalize the patient immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

WARNINGS

Rosiglitazone maleate: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, cause or exacerbate heart failure in some patients (5.2). After initiation of AVANDAMET, and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (including excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction must be considered. (5.2)
AVANDAMET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Initiation of AVANDAMET in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. (4, 5.2)
A meta-analysis of 52 clinical trials (mean duration 6 months; 16,995 total patients), most of which compared rosiglitazone to placebo, showed rosiglitazone to be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of myocardial infarction. Three other trials (mean duration 46 months; 14,067 total patients), comparing rosiglitazone to some other approved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, showed a statistically non-significant increased risk of myocardial infarction and a statistically non-significant decreased risk of death. There have been no clinical trials directly comparing cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone and ACTOS (pioglitazone, another thiazolidinedione), but in a separate trial, pioglitazone (when compared to placebo) did not show an increased risk of myocardial infarction or death.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Does long-term furosemide therapy cause thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure? A focused review [^112vzC65]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diuretic therapy is a cornerstone in the management of heart failure. Most studies assessing body thiamine status have reported variable degrees of thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure, particularly those treated chronically with high doses of furosemide. Thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure seems predominantly to be due to increased urine volume and urinary flow rate. There is also evidence that furosemide may directly inhibit thiamine uptake at the cellular level. Limited data suggest that thiamine supplementation is capable of increasing left ventricular ejection fraction and improving functional capacity in patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who were treated with diuretics (predominantly furosemide). Therefore, it may be reasonable to provide such patients with thiamine supplementation during heart failure exacerbations.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114UbfqK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

### Hyponatraemia in heart failure: time for new solutions? [^1167vCqU]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is very common in heart failure (HF), especially in decompensated patients. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and considered a marker of advanced disease. Recognition of hyponatraemia and its causes may help guide treatment strategy. Historically, therapy has primarily focused on water restriction, decongestion with loop diuretics in case of volume overload (dilutional hyponatraemia) and sodium repletion in case of depletion. In this review, we summarise the potential benefits of established and emerging HF therapies on sodium homeostasis, with a focus on dual vasopressin antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and hypertonic saline, and propose a potential therapeutic approach for hyponatraemia in HF.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure: is it time to change diuretic-centred paradigm? [^11597CLT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Congestion is a common cause of clinical deterioration and the most common clinical presentation at admission in acute heart failure (HF). Therefore, finding effective and sustainable ways to alleviate congestion has become a crucial goal for treating HF patients. Congestion is a result of complex underlying pathophysiology; therefore, it is not a direct cause of the disease but its consequence. Any therapy that directly promotes sodium/water removal only, thus targeting only clinical symptoms, neither modifies the natural course of the disease nor improves prognosis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the current decongestive therapies and propose a new (not diuretic-centred) paradigm of long-term congestion management in HF that attempts to correct the underlying pathophysiology, thus improving congestion, preventing its development, and favourably altering the natural course of the disease rather than merely treating its symptoms.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115RN2Sg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

### Water and electrolyte homeostasis during decongestion in heart failure [^112AgzL6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In heart failure, sodium retention generally occurs out of proportion to water retention and may occur disproportionate to chloride retention, requiring excretion of other cations (i.e. potassium, magnesium, and hydrogen). Renal homeostatic mechanisms keep chloride levels in balance, making it the primary regulator of intravascular tonicity. Excess total body sodium stores and potassium depletion increase the vulnerability to dehydration, especially in the intracellular compartment. With decompensation, extracellular volume expansion with sodium and chloride overload occurs, further enhancing potassium losses. While diuretics are vital to treat fluid overload, they derange important electrolyte and water balances. Diuretic therapies in heart failure produce disproportionate electrolyte-free water excretion, further exacerbate potassium depletion, and cause chloride losses disproportionate to natriuresis. This can be mitigated by allowing liberal electrolyte-free water intake, providing aggressive potassium and chloride supplementation, and using upfront proximal diuretics to preserve the chloride balance.

### The potential role of natriuretic peptide-guided management for patients hospitalized for heart failure [^114cwcEq]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

There are > 1 million hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) in the United States annually. After discharge, 25% of these patients are rehospitalized within 30 days, and 30% are dead within 1 year. To date, all trials in patients with acute HF (AHF) have failed to improve post-discharge outcomes. There remains a need for an effective objective risk stratification strategy that is capable of reliably identifying patients at heightened risk for readmission and informing discharge decision making. Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels during and after AHF hospitalization can provide valuable information regarding congestion status and chronic remodeling stress. The lack of sensitivity and inter-rater reliability of physical examination, and failure to achieve dry weight in many patients before discharge, renders the use of NP to guide therapy to prevent readmission an attractive option. NP levels can be used across the spectrum of AHF care settings, ranging from the emergency department and inpatient stay to post-discharge follow-up and chronic management. This review summarizes available data and provides an expert opinion on the potential role of NPs to reduce HF readmissions.

### Hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure: recognition, risk stratification, and treatment review [^112nhdJJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has emerged as a major healthcare problem. It causes approximately 3% of all hospitalizations in the United States, with the direct medical cost of these hospitalizations estimated at $18.8 billion per year. Early recognition, risk stratification, and evidence-based treatment are crucial in reducing the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this disorder. Classic signs and symptoms of ADHF, such as rales, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, may be absent at hospital presentation and, even when present, are not specific to this disorder. As a result, serum B-type natriuretic peptide level is now used to rapidly and accurately detect ADHF. Multivariate analyses have identified renal dysfunction, hypotension, advanced age, hyponatremia, and comorbidities as significant and independent mortality risk factors. Based on these factors, mortality risk can be stratified from very low to very high using published algorithms that have been validated in independent populations. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ADHF are available from both the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America. In general, an intravenous loop diuretic, either alone or in combination with a vasodilator, is recommended as initial therapy in patients with volume overload, depending on the patient's clinical status. Use of inotropic agents should be limited to the small subset of patients with low-output syndrome and significant hypotension. In any event, frequent monitoring of clinical response is essential, with subsequent therapy determined by this response. Finally, focused patient education during hospitalization may help reduce readmissions for ADHF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — management of fluid status includes that control of fluid retention may require progressive increments in the loop diuretic dose and frequently the addition of a second diuretic that has a complementary mode of action (e.g., metolazone). If volume overload persists despite these measures, hospitalization is generally required for further adjustment of therapy, possibly including intravenous dopamine or dobutamine, and ultrafiltration or hemodialysis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention; the use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of loop diuretics. In general, patients should not be discharged from the hospital until a stable and effective diuretic regimen is established, and ideally, not until euvolemia is achieved, after which the patient's dry weight can guide dose adjustments; many patients are able to modify their own diuretic regimen in response to changes in weight that exceed a predefined range. The restriction of dietary sodium (to 2 g a day or less) can greatly assist in the maintenance of volume balance, and patients with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction and high-dose diuretic use may benefit from review of fluid intake and restriction to 2 liters daily; the ongoing control of fluid retention may be enhanced by enrollment in an HF program.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111KHUFy]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^112ZFHAM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment of fluid status is challenging, and signs and symptoms often occur late. Thus, haemodynamic assessment may identify the need of patients for safe and effective changes in diuretic therapy, although this was not the specific aim of these trials. Also, various biomarkers have been proposed to assess congestion, as well as imaging toolsand the use of artificial intelligence. However, there is not sufficient evidence currently that diuretic therapy guidance using these tools may improve outcomes. Our data highlight the need for such specific trials and suggest significant room for improvement in the management of HF patients regarding diuretic therapy.

This study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly and most importantly, this was a post‐hoc analysis and patients were not randomized to down‐titration versus stable diuretic therapy. Therefore, our results are hypothesis‐generating only. Secondly, a major limitation of our work is the lack of other HF medication usage and dosage of patients during the trial. These can strongly affect the stability of HF patients and influence the decision‐making of clinicians with regard to diuretics. Thirdly, the exact volume status was not known at the time of dose change if done outside of study visits, nor is the application of fluid or salt restriction known for patients. This is of particular importance in the case of renal dysfunction, which may be related to different reasons including both dehydration and volume overload. Also, hypotension may be caused by dehydration or worsening of HF. Thus, it cannot be excluded that down‐titration was done despite volume overload in some cases. Nevertheless, the availability of information on why diuretic doses were changed is a major strength of our study.

### Beyond pulmonary edema: diagnostic, risk stratification, and treatment challenges of acute heart failure management in the emergency department [^113BU2oA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of heart failure hospitalizations in the United States originate in the emergency department (ED). Current strategies for acute heart failure syndromes have largely been tailored after chronic heart failure guidelines and care. Prospective ED-based acute heart failure syndrome trials are lacking, and current guidelines for disposition are based on either little or no evidence. As a result, the majority of ED acute heart failure syndrome patients are admitted to the hospital. Recent registry data suggest there is a significant amount of heterogeneity in acute heart failure syndrome ED presentations, and diagnostics and therapeutics may need to be individualized to the urgency of the presentation, underlying pathophysiology, and acute hemodynamic characteristics. A paradigm shift is necessary in acute heart failure syndrome guidelines and research: prospective trials need to focus on diagnostic, therapeutic, and risk-stratification algorithms that rely on readily available ED data, focusing on outcomes more proximate to the ED visit (5 days). Intermediate outcomes (30 days) are more dependent on inpatient and outpatient care and patient behavior than ED management decisions. Without these changes, the burden of acute heart failure syndrome care is unlikely to change. This article proposes such a paradigm shift in acute heart failure syndrome care and discusses areas of further research that are necessary to promote this change in approach.

Loop diuretic therapy in hospitalized heart failure — dosing and monitoring is outlined as follows: Table 7A provides guidance on timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan based on patient profile as represented in the randomized ARNI trials; subsequent IV diuretic doses are modified to achieve the desired daily response, and doses are often doubled until reaching 400 to 500 mg of furosemide equivalent per day; when the response is brisk but transient, the frequency should be increased to 3 to 4 times daily; the DOSE trial did not demonstrate improved outcomes with continuous infusion of IV furosemide, but patients with chronic furosemide equivalent doses of over 240 mg daily were excluded, while a Cochrane review suggested that loop diuretic agent infusions may produce greater net diuresis and better tolerability at equivalent doses compared with bolus dosing; measurement of urine sodium shortly after the start of therapy can be useful to evaluate diuretic responsiveness, with a spot urine sodium content < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after the diuretic dose correlated with a poor diuretic response and suggests consideration of dose.

### Aggressive fluid and sodium restriction in acute decompensated heart failure: a randomized clinical trial [^1135gPg5]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

The benefits of fluid and sodium restriction in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are unclear.

Objective

To compare the effects of a fluid-restricted (maximum fluid intake, 800 mL/d) and sodium-restricted (maximum dietary intake, 800 mg/d) diet (intervention group [IG]) vs a diet with no such restrictions (control group [CG]) on weight loss and clinical stability during a 3-day period in patients hospitalized with ADHF.

Design

Randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with blinded outcome assessments.

Setting

Emergency room, wards, and intensive care unit.

Participants

Adult inpatients with ADHF, systolic dysfunction, and a length of stay of 36 hours or less.

Intervention

Fluid restriction (maximum fluid intake, 800 mL/d) and additional sodium restriction (maximum dietary intake, 800 mg/d) were carried out until the seventh hospital day or, in patients whose length of stay was less than 7 days, until discharge. The CG received a standard hospital diet, with liberal fluid and sodium intake.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Weight loss and clinical stability at 3-day assessment, daily perception of thirst, and readmissions within 30 days.

Results

Seventy-five patients were enrolled (IG, 38; CG, 37). Most were male; ischemic heart disease was the predominant cause of heart failure (17 patients [23%]), and the mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was 26% (8.7%). The groups were homogeneous in terms of baseline characteristics. Weight loss was similar in both groups (between-group difference in variation of 0.25 kg [95% CI, -1.95 to 2.45]; p = 0.82) as well as change in clinical congestion score (between-group difference in variation of 0.59 points [95% CI, -2.21 to 1.03]; p = 0.47) at 3 days. Thirst was significantly worse in the IG (5.1 [2.9]) than the CG (3.44 [2.0]) at the end of the study period (between-group difference, 1.66 points; time × group interaction; p = 0.01). There were no significant between-group differences in the readmission rate at 30 days (IG, 11 patients [29%]; CG, 7 patients [19%]; p = 0.41).

Conclusions and Relevance

Aggressive fluid and sodium restriction has no effect on weight loss or clinical stability at 3 days and is associated with a significant increase in perceived thirst. We conclude that sodium and water restriction in patients admitted for ADHF are unnecessary.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112hA3jW]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics and decongestion strategies in patients with HF — In patients with HF who have fluid retention, diuretics are recommended to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, and prevent worsening HF. For patients with HF and congestive symptoms, addition of a thiazide (eg, metolazone) to treatment with a loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who do not respond to moderate- or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte abnormalities. Loop diuretics are the preferred diuretic agents for use in most patients with HF, while thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide may be considered in patients with hypertension and HF and mild fluid retention. Metolazone or chlorothiazide may be added to loop diuretics in patients with refractory edema unresponsive to loop diuretics alone. Diuretics should be prescribed to patients who have evidence of congestion or fluid retention, and in any patient with a history of congestion, maintenance diuretics should be considered to avoid recurrent symptoms. The treatment goal of diuretic use is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, using the lowest dose possible to maintain euvolemia. With the exception of MRAs, the effects of diuretics on morbidity and mortality are uncertain, and diuretics should not be used in isolation but always combined with other GDMT for HF that reduces hospitalizations and prolongs survival. Hyponatremia complicates HF management.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 heart failure — vasopressin receptor antagonists — Arginine vasopressin has cardiovascular and renal effects mediated through at least 2 receptor subtypes (V1a and V2); vasopressin levels are often elevated in HF with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and appear to be associated with adverse outcomes in the setting of low ejection fraction after myocardial infarction (MI). Early studies with 2 vasopressin receptor antagonists showed favorable changes in hemodynamics and urine output without significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate, with reductions in body weight and edema and normalization of serum sodium in hyponatremia, but the duration and significance of these clinical effects are not clear, and longer-term clinical trials are under way in chronic HF.

### Congestion in heart failure: a contemporary look at physiology, diagnosis and treatment [^1152TpUS]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Congestion is the main reason for hospitalization in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and is an important target for therapy. However, achieving complete decongestion can be challenging. Furthermore, residual congestion before discharge from hospital is associated with a high risk of early rehospitalization and death. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of congestion is of great importance in finding better and more personalized therapies. In this Review, we describe the two different forms of congestion - intravascular congestion and tissue congestion - and hypothesize that differentiating between and specifically treating these two different forms of congestion could improve the outcomes of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Although the majority of these patients have a combination of both intravascular and tissue congestion, one phenotype can dominate. Each of these two forms of congestion has a different pathophysiology and requires a different diagnostic approach. We provide an overview of novel and established biomarkers, imaging modalities and mechanical techniques for identifying each type of congestion. Treatment with loop diuretics, the current cornerstone of decongestive treatment, reduces circulating blood volume and thereby reduces intravascular congestion. However, the osmolality of the circulating blood decreases with the use of loop diuretics, which might result in less immediate translocation of fluid from the tissues (lungs, abdomen and periphery) to the circulation when the plasma refill rate is exceeded. By contrast, aquaretic drugs (such as vasopressin antagonists) predominantly cause water excretion, which increases the osmolality of the circulating blood, potentially improving translocation of fluid from the tissues to the circulation and thereby relieving tissue congestion.

### From hospital to home: evidence-based care for worsening heart Failure [^114fZ5iH]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapies for decongestion

Prompt recognition of clinical congestion in worsening HF (Table 2) and complete decongestion should be priorities during hospitalization. Residual congestion at discharge is associated with an increased risk of readmission and death. As HF advances, patients may develop resistance to loop diuretics, requiring high-dose intravenous (IV) boluses, infusions, or a combination of different diuretics. Diuretic intensification with an IV formulation that is 2.5 times the equivalent oral dose is associated with improved net diuresis and symptom relief, but diuretic responsiveness may vary. Spot urine sodium levels less than 50 to 70 mmol/L 2 hours following IV diuretics may indicate inadequate natriuresis or diuretic resistance, suggesting a need to increase the diuretic dose. A natriuresis-guided diuretic strategy in the PUSH-AHF (Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure) randomized controlled trial (RCT) improved mean 24-hour urine sodium excretion compared with standard of care without increased adverse effects. Hemoconcentration can be another sign of diuretic effect, although it is not a target for decongestion. While associated with worsening kidney function, hemoconcentration is associated with a lower risk of mortality at 180 days.

Table 2
Parameters of Congestion in HF

Loop diuretics are the mainstay of decongestion therapy. They should be titrated to the degree of congestion and maintained at the lowest effective dose required to achieve euvolemia quickly while avoiding volume depletion or metabolic derangements. Among loop diuretics, the TRANSFORM-HF (ToRsemide compArisoN With furoSemide FOR Management of Heart Failure) RCT tested a strategy of torsemide vs oral furosemide for decongestion among hospitalized patients at a frequency and dosage determined by the treating clinician. There was no difference in the primary outcome of mortality across LVEF categories in patients recently facing HHF after a median of 17.4 months follow up; the effect of torsemide on decongestion parameters was not evaluated. Either loop diuretic remains a viable option for patients at risk for congestion following discharge.

### Diuretics: still the mainstay of treatment [^117WKERh]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment of acute decompensated heart failure is diuretic therapy. While there are no data showing a morbidity or mortality benefit from the use of chronic diuretic therapy, diuretics rapidly improve symptoms associated with volume overload. Thus, despite concerns that some diuretics may cause harm by neurohormonal activation, these agents continue to be the first-line treatment for patients with heart failure. There is no conclusive evidence that one means of diuresis is better than another. When administration of moderate doses of loop diuretics is not sufficient, patients can be treated with higher doses, continuous infusions, or the addition of a thiazide diuretic or aldosterone antagonist. Diuretics improve symptoms but should be used in addition to other agents that improve the long-term outcome of patients with heart failure.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112z6NhT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure hospitalization — diuretic management and ultrafiltration are summarized as follows: Evidence of persistent congestion at discharge has been reported in 25% to 50% of patients, and diuresis should not be discontinued prematurely because elevations in the range of 0.3 mg/dL do not predict worse outcomes except when patients are discharged with persistent congestion. In the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus versus continuous infusion or at a high dose versus a low dose; however, patients in the low-dose group were more likely to require a 50% increase in the dose at 48 hours. Addition of low-dose dopamine to diuretic therapy in the setting of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not improve outcomes overall, although a subset analysis showed increased urine output and weight loss in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% with significant interaction of effect with LVEF. Bedside ultrafiltration initiated early after admission increased fluid loss, with decreased rehospitalizations in some studies when compared with use of diuretics without systematic escalation, but was also associated with adverse events related to intravenous catheters.

INTERMACS profiles — advanced heart failure severity classification (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) defines seven clinical profiles with characteristic features: Critical cardiogenic shock is characterized by life-threatening hypotension with rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support and critical organ hypoperfusion often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate; progressive decline describes patients "dependent" on inotropes with continuing deterioration or refractory volume overload when inotropes cannot be maintained because of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance; stable but inotrope dependent indicates clinical stability on mild–moderate intravenous inotropes or temporary circulatory support with repeated failure to wean; resting symptoms on oral therapy at home includes frequent congestion at rest or with activities of daily living with possible orthopnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, disabling ascites, or severe lower extremity edema; exertion intolerant patients are comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity and are housebound; exertion limited patients are comfortable at rest without fluid overload and can perform minor activities outside the home but develop fatigue within a few minutes or with any meaningful physical exertion; advanced NYHA class III patients are clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, usually able to walk more than a block, but any decompensation requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should be classified lower. Modifier options include recurrent decompensations for Profiles 3 to 6 defined by frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 mo) for intravenous diuresis, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy; if a Profile 7 patient meets these criteria, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse; additional modifiers include recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, frequent ICD shocks or external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly) or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

### Decongestion strategies in patients presenting with acutely decompensated heart failure: a worldwide survey among physicians [^112e7z7Y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Decongestion strategies for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) characterized by volume overload differ widely. The aim of this independent international academic web-based survey was to capture the therapeutic strategies that physicians use to treat ADHF and to assess differences in therapeutic approaches between cardiologists versus non-cardiologists.

Methods and Results

Physicians were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire, capturing anonymized data on physicians' characteristics and treatment preferences based on a hypothetical clinical scenario of a patient hospitalized with ADHF. A total of 641 physicians from 60 countries participated. A wide variation in the management of the patient was observed. There was conservative use of diuretics, i.e. only 7% started intravenous furosemide at a dose ≥ 2 times the baseline oral dose, and infrequent use of ultrasound in assessing congestion (20.4%). Spot urinary sodium was infrequently or never measured by ≥ 85% of physicians. A third considered a patient with ongoing oedema as being stabilized. There were significant differences between cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of ADHF, the targets for daily body weight loss and urine output, diuretic escalation strategies (66.3% vs. 40.7% would escalate diuresis by adding a thiazide) and assessment of response to treatment (27.0% vs. 52.9% considered patients with minimal congestion as stabilized).

Conclusions

There is substantial variability amongst physicians and between cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of patients with ADHF, with regard to clinical parameters used to tailor treatment, treatment goals, diuretic dosing and escalation strategies.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Management of low blood pressure in ambulatory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients [^115u1rDk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Step II: Identify hypotensive factors unrelated to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and stop/reduce non‐heart failure with reduced ejection fraction blood pressure‐lowering therapies

Non‐drug related causes of hypotensive episodes should be investigated, such as diarrhoea, fever, dehydration, etc. In such cases, the cause of hypotension should be corrected, and chronic HF treatment should not be changed over the long term. However, transient discontinuation of HF therapies may be considered (especially for diuretics when dehydration is observed) until resolution of the acute event. Early re‐introduction should be attempted whenever possible.

In the absence of the aforementioned causes of hypotension, BP‐lowering treatments without evidence of morbidity‐mortality reduction in HFrEF patients should be decreased or stopped. Cardiovascular treatments not indicated in HFrEF, such as calcium channel blockers, centrally‐acting antihypertensive drugs or alpha‐blockers, should be reduced or discontinued, regardless of the form of administration. It is also critical to identify 'hidden' hypotensive drugs (such as alpha‐blockers in the context of prostate disease or intraocular beta‐blockers in case of glaucoma) and replace the latter with another drug class (Figure 2).

### Loop diuretic resistance in heart failure: resistance etiology-based strategies to restoring diuretic efficacy [^114hxaG5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are a cornerstone of symptom management for nearly all patients with heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a clinical problem with similar presentation despite diverse and multiple etiologies. Although the exact incidence is not known, diuretic resistance occurs frequently and can increase the length of hospitalization. Despite the prevalence of loop diuretic prescription in heart failure and frequency of diuretic resistance, current heart failure guidelines provide nonspecific guidance on strategies to restore diuretic efficacy. Providers are left with many questions regarding the optimum diuretic titration strategy in the setting of diuretic resistance. In light of these highly prevalent uncertainties, we present a case vignette-structured literature review of the mechanisms of diuretic resistance and recommend therapeutic strategies based on the resistance etiology to improve diuretic response in acute decompensated heart failure.

10.2. Fluid management and diuretics — Loop diuretics are commonly used as first-line therapy either with intermittent dosing or as a continuous infusion, and continuous infusions of loop diuretics may be of increased benefit in neonates and children with HF who are critically ill by increasing the likelihood of achieving a negative fluid balance and mitigating rapid fluid shifts, while a low sodium diet and fluid restriction are often considered there are no data (even in adults) to support this practice. Recommendations: An initial and ongoing assessment of fluid status should be performed in all patients admitted to the hospital with acute HF (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Diuretics are the first-line therapy for patients with acute HF with evidence of fluid overload (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Careful monitoring for side effects of anticongestive therapies, including renal function, electrolytes, and hypotension, should be performed in all patients with acute HF (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical trajectories and diuretic management in hospitalized HF — patients who are responding well to diuresis and are hemodynamically stable should have guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) up-titrated as tolerated, aiming to implement all 4 components of GDMT for HFrEF; intravenous (IV) diuretic agents should generally be continued until optimal decongestion is achieved, then patients should transition to the oral dose estimated for maintenance; in the large Optum database, there was a higher rate of early mortality and readmission in the 19% of patients who had IV diuretic agents stopped (for an average of 3 days) and then restarted before discharge; initiation of SGLT inhibitor during hospitalization should prompt reassessment of the diuretic regimen planned for discharge; for nonresponders or those who worsen, invasive monitoring and/or the addition of vasodilators or inotropic therapy may be considered, usually best guided by subspecialty consultation.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥ 20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Worsening of chronic heart failure: definition, epidemiology, management and prevention. A clinical consensus statement by the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^111tB2rr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Episodes of worsening symptoms and signs characterize the clinical course of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). These events are associated with poorer quality of life, increased risks of hospitalization and death and are a major burden on healthcare resources. They usually require diuretic therapy, either administered intravenously or by escalation of oral doses or with combinations of different diuretic classes. Additional treatments may also have a major role, including initiation of guideline-recommended medical therapy (GRMT). Hospital admission is often necessary but treatment in the emergency service or in outpatient clinics or by primary care physicians has become increasingly used. Prevention of first and recurring episodes of worsening HF is an essential component of HF treatment and this may be achieved through early and rapid administration of GRMT. The aim of the present clinical consensus statement by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology is to provide an update on the definition, clinical characteristics, management and prevention of worsening HF in clinical practice.

### Dietary sodium and fluid intake in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^11128zrK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium and fluid restriction has traditionally been advocated in patients with heart failure (HF) due to their sodium and water avid state. However, most evidence regarding the altered sodium handling, fluid homeostasis and congestion-related signs and symptoms in patients with HF originates from untreated patient cohorts and physiological investigations. Recent data challenge the beneficial role of dietary sodium and fluid restriction in HF. Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines have gradually downgraded these recommendations over time, now advising for the limitation of salt intake to no more than 5g/day in patients with HF, while contemplating fluid restriction of 1.5–2L/day only in selected patients. Therefore, the objective of this clinical consensus statement is to provide advice on fluid and sodium intake in patients with acute and chronic HF, based on contemporary evidence and expert opinion.

### Urinary sodium analysis: the key to effective diuretic titration? European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^111WLHZC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with heart failure, neurohumoral activation leads to increased renal sodium avidity across the entire renal tubules, resulting in a positive sodium and water balance, leading to decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. As the dose of diuretic therapy required to achieve euvolaemia is difficult to estimate due to considerable intra- and interindividual differences, the European Society of Cardiology recommends assessment of the diuretic response within hours either via evaluation of the urinary sodium concentration or via urinary volume after initial diuretic administration. All diuretic agents enhance sodium excretion to a different extent depending on their side of action across the renal tubules, and renal adaptation mechanisms due to neurohumoral stimulation. Impaired sodium excretion, even in the presence of fluid loss, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, assessing urinary sodium excretion is considered a good and direct marker of the diuretic efficacy. Such natriuresis-guided protocols have been tested prospectively by the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure and the Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure study, both demonstrating increased natriuresis and diuresis. Moreover, the Readily Available Urinary Sodium Analysis in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure study has demonstrated that a nurse-led natriuresis-guided protocol is feasible through the use of a point-of-care urinary sodium sensor, allowing an immediately readable urinary sodium result, enabling fast changes in diuretic therapy. This review summaries the rationale, current evidence and gaps supporting the role of urinary sodium concentration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Diuretic therapy in heart failure — supportive evidence indicates controlled trials increased urinary sodium excretion, decreased physical signs of fluid retention, and improved symptoms, QOL, and exercise tolerance; registry data revealed reduced 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared with no diuretic use after discharge; in outpatients, low-dose therapy is titrated until urine output increases and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily; diuretic resistance can be addressed by escalation of loop diuretic dose, intravenous bolus or continuous infusion, or combining diuretic classes; combining a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (e.g., metolazone) with a loop diuretic enhances natriuresis but, in a propensity-score matched analysis of hospitalized heart failure, adding metolazone increased hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality, whereas higher loop diuretic doses were not found to adversely affect survival; the DOSE trial supports the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretics.

### Decongestive treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: cardiorenal implications of ultrafiltration and diuretics [^116CqBdi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), treatment aimed at adequate decongestion of the volume overloaded state is essential. Despite diuretic therapy, many patients remain volume overloaded and symptomatic. In addition, adverse effects related to diuretic treatment are common, including worsening kidney function and electrolyte disturbances. The development of decreased kidney function during treatment affects the response to diuretic therapy and is associated with important clinical outcomes, including mortality. The occurrence of diuretic resistance and the morbidity and mortality associated with diuretic therapy has stimulated interest to develop effective and safe treatment strategies that maximize decongestion and minimize decreased kidney function. During the last few decades, extracorporeal ultrafiltration has been used to remove fluid from diuretic-refractory hypervolemic patients. Recent clinical studies using user-friendly machines have suggested that ultrafiltration may be highly effective for decongesting patients with ADHF. Many questions remain regarding the comparative impact of diuretics and ultrafiltration on important clinical outcomes and adverse effects, including decreased kidney function. This article serves as a summary of key clinical studies addressing these points. The overall goal is to assist practicing clinicians who are contemplating the use of ultrafiltration for a patient with ADHF.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure [^1178SLXV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion is a major reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure (HF). Therapeutic strategies to manage congestion include diuretics, vasodilators, ultrafiltration, vasopressin antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and potentially also novel therapies such as gut sequesterants and serelaxin. Uncertainty exists with respect to the appropriate decongestion strategy for an individual patient. In this review, we summarize the benefit and risk profiles for these decongestion strategies and provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach for different patients. An evidence-based initial approach to congestion management involves high-dose i.v. diuretics with addition of vasodilators for dyspnoea relief if blood pressure allows. To enhance diuresis or overcome diuretic resistance, options include dual nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics or natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Vasopressin antagonists may improve aquaresis and relieve dyspnoea. If diuretic strategies are unsuccessful, then ultrafiltration may be considered. Ultrafiltration should be used with caution in the setting of worsening renal function. This review is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives at the 9th Global Cardio Vascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Paris, France, from 30 November to 1 December 2012.
