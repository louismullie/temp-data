## Question

Does meloxicam have less cardiac side effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether meloxicam has fewer cardiac side effects compared with other NSAIDs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory baseline and whether there is a class effect for NSAIDs. Then, I should verify how meloxicam's COX-2 selectivity influences cardiovascular risk. Next, I will review head-to-head and comparative evidence versus other NSAIDs, including diclofenac, naproxen, and celecoxib. After that, I need to check special high-risk populations like post-MI and heart failure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and monitoring guidance, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling for meloxicam carries a boxed warning that NSAIDs increase the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal, and this risk may occur early and increase with duration of use; this applies to all NSAIDs, including meloxicam, so there is a class cardiovascular risk signal that I must not overlook [^1114pdnY] [^111cNjAE] [^112MSkyT].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic angle. Meloxicam is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, which reduces prostacyclin and can tilt the thromboxane–prostacyclin balance toward a prothrombotic state; this is the same theoretical concern that emerged with coxibs, and it explains why even preferential COX-2 blockade can increase cardiovascular risk, particularly at higher doses or with prolonged exposure [^117YWLkd] [^1158tDMn].

> Next, I should review comparative evidence. A pooled analysis of 28 trials including 24,196 patients found that meloxicam 7.5 mg daily had a lower risk of serious upper GI events than diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam, and importantly, thromboembolic events were less frequent with meloxicam than with diclofenac, with rates similar to piroxicam and naproxen; this suggests a more favorable cardiovascular profile relative to diclofenac, though absolute differences were small and follow-up was limited [^112Gatxu]. Hold on, I should verify consistency with broader syntheses; a high-quality network meta-analysis indicated that naproxen had the most favorable cardiovascular profile among NSAIDs, while diclofenac carried higher cardiovascular risk, and celecoxib at usual doses was approximately neutral, placing meloxicam somewhere in the middle rather than clearly safer than all comparators [^114tjZrc] [^115cpM1M].

> I will now examine real-world and post-MI data. Observational registry data from Korea in 108,232 post-MI patients showed that NSAID use markedly increased risks of cardiovascular and bleeding events, but among NSAID subtypes, celecoxib and meloxicam had the lowest hazards, with meloxicam associated with HRs around 3.03 for cardiovascular events and 2.80 for bleeding; while still elevated, these were lower than many other NSAIDs, suggesting that if an NSAID must be used after MI, meloxicam may be a relatively safer choice within the class, though avoidance is preferred when possible [^113U4yrP]. But wait, what if the baseline risk is very high? Danish registry data similarly show increased reinfarction, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality with NSAIDs after MI, reinforcing that even "lower-risk" NSAIDs like meloxicam still add risk in this population and should be avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh harms [^113U4yrP].

> Let me consider heart failure and hypertension. NSAIDs as a class can worsen heart failure via sodium retention and antagonism of renal prostaglandins, and professional society guidance advises avoiding NSAIDs in patients with established or decompensated heart failure; meloxicam shares this risk, so I should caution against its use in HF unless no alternatives exist and monitoring is planned [^113hfqfc] [^113sEDRZ]. I should double-check blood pressure effects; NSAIDs can raise BP and blunt the effects of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, so in patients with hypertension or those on RAAS blockade, meloxicam may exacerbate control and should be used at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^113sEDRZ].

> Next, I should review dose and duration effects. The cardiovascular risk appears dose related and increases with longer exposure; therefore, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration is a key mitigation strategy, and for meloxicam, many clinicians favor 7.5 mg daily rather than 15 mg when feasible to reduce COX-1 effects and overall risk, acknowledging that even 7.5 mg is not risk-free [^111cNjAE] [^113cATr4]. Hold on, I should verify whether 7.5 mg meaningfully changes COX-1 inhibition; pharmacodynamic data indicate partial COX-1 inhibition even at therapeutic doses, so dose minimization helps but does not eliminate risk [^113cATr4].

> I need to ensure I address aspirin interaction. Concurrent use of meloxicam with low-dose aspirin increases the risk of serious GI bleeding and does not reliably mitigate the cardiovascular thrombotic risk; thus, if aspirin is indicated for secondary prevention, gastroprotection with a PPI is prudent when an NSAID is necessary, and the NSAID should be used at the lowest dose and shortest duration with vigilant monitoring for GI bleeding [^111cNjAE] [^112NykmF]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup negates this; current evidence does not show that aspirin co-therapy neutralizes NSAID-associated cardiovascular risk, so the interaction remains clinically relevant [^111cNjAE].

> But wait, what about special formulations and acute pain settings. Intravenous meloxicam has been studied in perioperative populations with signals of reduced opioid consumption and generally similar cardiovascular event rates to placebo in pooled analyses, though these trials were not powered for hard cardiovascular endpoints; thus, short-term IV use may carry a different risk–benefit calculus in multimodal analgesia, but caution remains warranted in patients with high cardiovascular risk [^115oGaHw] [^114hFU28]. I should confirm that these data do not override the class warning; they do not, and labeling still advises using the lowest effective dose and monitoring for CV events even with short-term use [^111cNjAE].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. Contemporary guidance emphasizes individualized risk assessment, with naproxen or low-dose celecoxib often preferred in patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if meloxicam is used, it should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time with attention to GI and CV risk modifiers; in older adults, the Beers Criteria advise avoiding chronic NSAIDs unless alternatives are ineffective and gastroprotection is in place, which applies to meloxicam as well [^116kyLjX] [^1168c4gB]. For post-MI or ACS, cardiology guidance recommends avoiding NSAIDs when possible; if absolutely necessary, meloxicam may be among the relatively less harmful options, but the default remains avoidance and close monitoring if used [^113U4yrP] [^116R212h].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Meloxicam does not have fewer cardiac side effects than NSAIDs as a class; it carries a boxed warning for serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and increases MI and stroke risk, particularly with higher doses and longer duration. However, compared with some NSAIDs, especially diclofenac, meloxicam may have a more favorable cardiovascular profile, and in high-risk populations such as post-MI patients, observational data suggest lower hazard with meloxicam than with several alternatives, though absolute risk remains elevated and avoidance is preferred when possible [^1114pdnY] [^112vXNAA] [^113U4yrP]. Therefore, the clinically sound approach is to use meloxicam only when clearly indicated, at 7.5 mg daily when effective, for the shortest necessary duration, with GI risk mitigation as indicated, and with heightened vigilance in patients with cardiovascular disease or those on aspirin therapy [^111cNjAE] [^116kyLjX].

---

Meloxicam does not have fewer cardiac side effects than other NSAIDs. Like all NSAIDs, it increases the risk of **serious cardiovascular events** (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death) [^111cNjAE], and this risk can occur early in treatment and rises with duration of use [^115n97Cw]. Meloxicam is **not safer for the heart** than nonselective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and its cardiovascular risk is comparable to other NSAIDs, including COX-2 selective agents [^112vXNAA]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and avoid meloxicam in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk [^111cNjAE].

---

## Cardiovascular risks associated with meloxicam

Meloxicam, like other NSAIDs, **increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events**, including:

- **Myocardial infarction (MI)**: Increased risk of MI, including fatal events [^111cNjAE].
- **Stroke**: Increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular death**: Higher risk of cardiovascular mortality, particularly with prolonged use [^notfound].

These risks are **dose- and duration-dependent**, with higher risks observed at higher doses and with longer treatment periods [^115n97Cw]. The risk can manifest as early as the first weeks of treatment [^115n97Cw].

---

## Comparative cardiovascular safety of meloxicam

Meloxicam is often perceived as having fewer cardiac side effects due to its **COX-2 selectivity** [^115Sc2NG]. However, this perception is misleading. While COX-2 selectivity reduces gastrointestinal adverse effects, it does not confer cardiovascular safety. In fact, COX-2 selective NSAIDs, including meloxicam, have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk due to impaired prostacyclin synthesis, which promotes thrombosis [^117YWLkd].

Comparative studies and meta-analyses have shown that meloxicam's cardiovascular risk is **comparable to other NSAIDs**, including nonselective agents such as ibuprofen and diclofenac [^112vXNAA]. Notably, meloxicam has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to naproxen, which is often considered to have a more favorable cardiovascular profile [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Clinical evidence and professional guidelines consistently emphasize the **cardiovascular risks** associated with meloxicam:

- **FDA warnings**: The FDA has issued boxed warnings for meloxicam, highlighting the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including MI and stroke [^1114pdnY].
- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend avoiding NSAIDs, including meloxicam, in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk [^notfound].
- **AHA scientific statement**: The American Heart Association advises that NSAIDs, including meloxicam, should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible in patients with heart failure due to increased risk of hospitalization, MI, and mortality [^113hfqfc].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations are at **particularly high risk** of cardiovascular events with meloxicam:

- **Patients with established cardiovascular disease**: History of MI, stroke, or coronary artery disease [^notfound].
- **Patients with cardiovascular risk factors**: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking [^notfound].
- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk due to age-related cardiovascular vulnerability [^1174zKmq].
- **Patients with heart failure**: Increased risk of hospitalization, MI, and mortality [^113hfqfc].

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given the cardiovascular risks associated with meloxicam, the following **clinical recommendations** are advised:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration [^111cNjAE].
- **Avoidance in high-risk patients**: Avoid meloxicam in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk [^112NykmF].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative analgesics, such as acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs, particularly in high-risk patients [^115cpM1M].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and cardiovascular symptoms during therapy [^113sEDRZ].

---

Meloxicam does not have fewer cardiac side effects than other NSAIDs. It carries a **significant risk of serious cardiovascular events**, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. This risk is comparable to other NSAIDs and is dose- and duration-dependent. Therefore, meloxicam should be used cautiously, at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and avoided in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk.

5.2	Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with XIFYRM. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short- term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

 Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue XIFYRM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical
trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to
three years' duration have shown an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and
stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and
nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease
or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the
potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an
NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest
duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV
symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms
of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. Two
large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery
found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see
Contraindications (4.2)]. There is no consistent evidence that
concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV
thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of
aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^116fTTuE]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic):
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Avoid using in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Do not use in patients undergoing CABG.
- **Serious gastrointestinal adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, especially in elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitor for signs of bleeding.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: are they really atherothrombotic, and if not, why not? [^115RRVa6]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY: Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are increasingly being used in place of "conventional" nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is because they are just as effective as NSAIDs in relieving arthritic pain and yet less gastrotoxic. However, the cardiovascular safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been questioned because they selectively reduce prostacyclin production, thus disrupting the normal homeostatic balance and promoting a prothrombotic state. These theoretical concerns appear to be supported by the results of clinical trials demonstrating an increased risk of myocardial infarction with COX-2 inhibitors compared with a conventional NSAID, and indirect comparisons of the rates of myocardial infarction among patients treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor compared with aspirin in different trials. However, emerging data from animal, experimental and clinical studies suggest that COX-2 is atherogenic and thrombogenic, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be cardioprotective. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo have demonstrated no excess of cardiovascular events among patients allocated COX-2 inhibitors, and preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial of the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam, in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were treated with aspirin, demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients allocated the COX-2 inhibitor.

Conclusions

Continuing uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of any cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors, coupled with their widespread and increasing use, mandates prospective randomized evaluation of their efficacy and safety in patients at increased risk of future cardiovascular events.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of Meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, a component of SYMBRAVO, can cause serious GI adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with meloxicam. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective SSRIs; smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-Treated Patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue SYMBRAVO until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.3 Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue SYMBRAVO if these disturbances occur.

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of VIVLODEX in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If VIVLODEX is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

### FDA strengthens warning that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti… [^115n97Cw]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

- Non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, either of which can be fatal. There are a large number of studies that support this finding, with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased. Estimates of increased risk range from 10 percent to 50 percent or more, depending on the drugs and the doses studied. This risk may occur as early as the first weeks of treatment and may increase with duration of use. Based on our comprehensive review and the recommendations from the advisory committees, we are requiring label changes to reflect the following conclusions:

- A large number of studies support the finding that NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased.

Estimates of increased relative risk range from 10 percent to 50 percent or more, depending on the drugs and the doses studied.
- Several observational studies found a significant cardiovascular risk within days to weeks of NSAID initiation. Some data also showed a higher risk with longer NSAID treatment.
- There are observational data indicating that the thrombotic cardiovascular risk from NSAID use is dose-related. There is also some evidence of this dose-response effect from clinical trials of celecoxib.
- Some observational studies and the CNT meta-analysis suggested that naproxen may have a lower risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events compared to the other NSAIDs; however, the observational studies and the indirect comparisons used in the meta-analysis to assess the risk of the nonselective NSAIDs have limitations that affect their interpretability.

The variability in patients' risk factors, comorbidities, concomitant medications and drug interactions, doses being used, duration of treatment, etc., also need to be taken into consideration to make valid comparisons. Importantly, these studies were not designed to demonstrate superior safety of one NSAID compared to another.
- There is evidence of an increased cardiovascular risk from NSAID use by apparently healthy patients. Data from the CNT meta-analysis, individual randomized controlled trials, and observational studies showed that the relative increase in cardiovascular thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, patients with known cardiovascular disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess cardiovascular thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^112GEcqT]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ns-NSAIDs, being COX-1-inhibitors, all impair thromboxane A 2 synthesis and, as a consequence, platelet aggregation, although the magnitude and duration of this effect varies amongst the different compounds. With the exception of diclofenac and meloxicam, almost all ns-NSAIDs can interfere with the anti-aggregant effect of aspirin.

While the pharmacodynamic, negative interaction between ns-NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin has been clearly established by studies in healthy volunteers and patients, the clinical consequences of such interaction are still not definitely ascertained. Indeed, available epidemiological studies provided conflicting results, with only three out of six reports showing a reduction of the cardio-protective effect of aspirin. However, the few RCTs available are consistent in their findings that ns-NSAID use does worsen the CV outcome in patients taking low-dose aspirin. Indeed, in the Physicians' Health Study, the regular use of these agents was associated with an increased risk (RR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.25–6.56) of acute recurrent myocardial infarction. Similarly, in the Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial (TARGET), designed to assess the GI and CV safety of lumiracoxib versus naproxen and ibuprofen, a post hoc subgroup analysis of high CV risk patients (n = 3,042) taking low-dose aspirin (60%) found a higher CV event rate in ibuprofen users compared to lumiracoxib users (1.48 versus 0.85 events per 100 patient/years). Besides the CV harm, concomitant administration of ns-NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin can be followed by stroke recurrence in patients with prior cerebrovascular events.

5.1 Cardiovascular (CV) Thrombotic Events with NSAID Use

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. The risk of these events following single-dose local application of ZYNRELEF is uncertain.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, do not exceed the recommended dose. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events following treatment with ZYNRELEF, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. ZYNRELEF is contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

### Are COX-2 inhibitors preferable to non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with risk of cardiovascular events taking low-dose aspirin? [^114pjhUp]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. Only aspirin offers primary and secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, but trials have not answered directly whether low-dose aspirin is cardioprotective with COX-2 inhibitors. A large inception cohort study showed that concomitant use of aspirin reduced risk of cardiovascular events when given with rofecoxib, celecoxib, sulindac, meloxicam, and indometacin but not when given with ibuprofen. In large trials assessing gastrointestinal safety, there were fewer gastrointestinal events in patients using both COX-2 inhibitors and aspirin than in those using non-selective NSAIDs and aspirin; significantly fewer uncomplicated upper gastrointestinal events took place in the MEDAL trial. Analysis of VIGOR and two capsule endoscopy studies showed significantly less distal gastrointestinal blood loss with COX-2 inhibitors than with non-selective NSAIDs. Endoscopy trials showed that low-dose aspirin does not diminish the gastrointestinal benefits of COX-2 inibitors over non-selective NSAIDs. In an elderly epidemiological cohort receiving aspirin, both celecoxib and rofecoxib reduced risk of admission for gastrointestinal events. Comparison of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks is difficult: likelihood and severity of cardiovascular events differ between individuals, agents, and exposure. Mortality associated with gastrointestinal events is less frequent than with cardiovascular events, but asymptomatic ulcers can result in severe complications. Data support the conclusion that COX-2 inhibitors are preferable to non-selective NSAIDs in patients with chronic pain and cardiovascular risk needing low-dose aspirin, but relative risks and benefits should be assessed individually for each patient.

8.3	Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

 Females

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including XIFYRM, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including XIFYRM, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

Males

XIFYRM may compromise fertility in males of reproductive potential. In a published study, oral administration of meloxicam to male rats for 35 days resulted in decreased sperm count and motility and histopathological evidence of testicular degeneration at 0.3-times the MRHD based on BSA comparison [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is not known if these effects on fertility are reversible. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of XIFYRM has not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.4)].

Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of meloxicam injection, 197 patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

XIFYRM has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. For oral meloxicam, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Since meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the liver and hepatotoxicity may occur, monitor for adverse events in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for and the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Anaphylactic Reactions

Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible if they develop any type of rash or fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14, 5.15)].

Methemoglobinemia

Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Fetal Toxicity

Inform pregnant women of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus if ZYNRELEF or other NSAIDs are used starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with ZYNRELEF is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios because meloxicam can be detected in plasma beyond 48 hours after administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Intravenous meloxicam for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain: a pooled analysis of safety and opioid-reducing effects [^115oGaHw]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To describe the safety and tolerability of intravenous meloxicam compared with placebo across all phase II/III clinical trials.

Methods

Safety data and opioid use from subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain who received ≥ 1 dose of intravenous meloxicam (5–60 mg) or placebo in 1 of 7 studies (4 phase II; 3 phase III) were pooled. Data from intravenous meloxicam 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg groups were combined (low-dose subset).

Results

A total of 1426 adults (86.6% white; mean age: 45.8 years) received ≥ 1 dose of meloxicam IV; 517 (77.6% white; mean age: 46.7 years) received placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in intravenous meloxicam and placebo-treated subjects was 47% and 57%, respectively. The most commonly reported TEAEs across treatment groups (intravenous meloxicam 5–15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively) were nausea (4.3%, 20.8%, 5.8% and 25.3%), headache (1.5%, 5.6%, 1.6% and 10.4%), vomiting (2.8%, 4.6%, 1.6% and 7.4%) and dizziness (0%, 3.5%, 1.1% and 4.8%). TEAE incidence was generally similar in subjects aged > 65 years with impaired renal function and the general population. Similar rates of cardiovascular events were reported between treatment groups. One death was reported (placebo group; unrelated to study drug). There were 35 serious adverse events (SAEs); intravenous meloxicam 15 mg (n = 5), intravenous meloxicam 30 mg (n = 15) and placebo (n = 15). The SAEs in meloxicam-treated subjects were determined to be unrelated to study medication. Six subjects withdrew due to TEAEs, including three treated with intravenous meloxicam (rash, localized edema and postprocedural pulmonary embolism). In trials where opioid use was monitored, meloxicam reduced postoperative rescue opioid use.

Conclusions

Intravenous meloxicam was generally well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^112jug7F]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of the meta-analysis

Our analysis has several limitations. Firstly, we were unable to consider all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in our analysis: large scale randomised controlled trials are lacking for most of the older drugs and even for some newer ones, such as valdecoxib or meloxicam. Nevertheless, we were able to include all relevant cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, except valdecoxib, and the three most commonly used traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. By disregarding small studies we minimised the risk of small study effects. Small studies would have had minimal impact on the analysis anyway, because of low numbers of events. Secondly, we were able to obtain unpublished data only for the trials of celecoxib and lumiracoxib, whereas Merck, the manufacturer of rofecoxib and etoricoxib, was not willing to provide unpublished safety data. Therefore some data were missing for trials sponsored by Merck. This is disconcerting in the light of the safety concerns raised by our analysis for both drugs, rofecoxib and etoricoxib, manufactured by Merck. Thirdly, the quality of our analysis is limited by the quality of the underlying data. Although the methodological quality of included trials was generally satisfactory, the quality of reporting was often less than optimaland we found discrepancies in the reported number of events between different sources of information for major trials including ADVANTAGE (Assessment of Differences between Vioxx and Naproxen To Ascertain Gastrointestinal Tolerability and Effectiveness), VIGOR (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), and APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx). Several trials lacked independent adjudication of events, therefore bias in either direction cannot be excluded, including bias towards the null owing to non-differential misclassification of events or assessor bias in trials without independent adjudication. Nevertheless, the analysis restricted to trials with independent adjudication of events supported the robustness of our main analysis (see web extra appendix 2). Fourthly, one study explored the effects of dosage and regimen in a pooled analysis of six randomised placebo controlled trials of celecoxib and found that lower dosages and once daily regimens that avoided continuous interference of the drug with prostaglandin metabolism were associated with lower relative risks for the cardiovascular composite outcome than higher dosages and twice daily regimens. We were unable to satisfactorily deal with these matters in our analysis mainly because of the complexity of the network and the low number of patients treated with low dosages. In addition, regimens used in clinical practice might differ from the regimens used in the included clinical trials. Intermittent usage seems to be more common in clinical practice than the chronic long term usage in the trials, resulting in less intense drug use. Because none of the trials used intermittent regimens and drugs were used for at least one year in most of the trials we were unable to investigate the impact of drug use on cardiovascular outcomes. Data from the General Practice Research Database indicate, however, that about half of the patients have patterns of drug intake comparable to those evaluated in the trials included in this network meta-analysis, and we submit that the results of our study are applicable to these patients. Finally, we carried out several sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of the results. Unfortunately, owing to the low number of accumulated events, estimates from these analyses were imprecise and do not allow any meaningful conclusion. This is particularly true for the analysis restricted to patients with musculoskeletal conditions: many of the point estimates could not be derived at all and others seemed to contradict the main results, but credibility intervals were compatible with both, major benefits or detrimental harms.

### Drug insight: cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk – where are we now? [^117YWLkd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 1 mediates the production of thromboxane A2 in platelets, leading to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Conversely, COX2 catalyzes endothelial prostacyclin synthesis, which effectively counteracts thromboxane A2, triggering vasodilation and platelet inhibition. Selective COX2 inhibitors decrease prostacyclin production, potentially disrupting homeostasis and creating a prothrombotic state. The VIGOR study findings of increased cardiovascular risk with rofecoxib were subsequently confirmed by large meta-analyses, observational studies and recent APPROVe trial publication. The APC trial findings of increased cardiovascular risk with Celebrex (celecoxib) conflict with those in the ADAPT trial, the upcoming PreSAP publication, a case-control study by Graham et al. and prior large clinical trials, meta-analyses and observational studies of this drug. Therefore, while an adverse class effect is a possibility for COX2 inhibitors, the published data are inconsistent. Baseline cardiovascular risk in patients might contribute significantly to these findings. In light of the negative Vioxx (rofecoxib) publicity, however, COX2 inhibitors might forever remain underinvestigated. The relative selectivity of these compounds for COX2 is extremely variable, casting significant doubt on the class-effect hypothesis. Improved endothelial function has also been reported with celecoxib, leading to endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and associated decreases in C-reactive protein and LDL cholesterol. The addition of meloxicam to low-dose aspirin and heparin has improved clinical outcomes after acute coronary syndromes. These are the first studies suggesting improvement in endothelial function and reduction of inflammation with COX2 inhibition. Thus, more randomized controlled trials are needed to study the relative cardiovascular effects of different COX2 inhibitors, alone and in combination with aspirin.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1155uCY1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The time to onset of treatment effect was determined using the 2-stopwatch technique. Stopwatches were started when subjects received study medication. The first watch was stopped when pain relief was first perceptible, and the second watch was stopped when pain relief was considered meaningful.

Subjects rated the pain relief effect of study medication by assigning a GES (0 = poor, 1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, and 4 = excellent) at the time of rescue medication or 24 hours postdose if rescue medication was not used.

Safety was assessed throughout the study via AE monitoring, with AEs of special interest highlighted based on known association with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Additional safety evaluation included clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms, wound-site evaluations, pulse oximetry, and concomitant medication use.

### Is meloxicam as safe as other NSAIDs?… [^112Gatxu]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Synopsis: Meloxicam is an NSAID that preferentially inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 receptor. Investigators pooled data from 28 published and unpublished trials that included a total of 24, 196 patients to assess the safety profile of meloxicam. The duration of most trials was 60 days or less. Meloxicam in a dosage of 7. 5 mg or 15 mg per day was compared with diclofenac in a dosage of 100 to 150 mg per day, piroxicam in a dosage of 20 mg per day, or naproxen in a dosage of 500 mg twice per day. Seriousgastrointestinalcomplications included gastric or duodenal perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, and hemodynamically important GI bleeding. Thromboembolic events included myocardial infarction and stroke, but not deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The investigators who judged whether adverse events met the definitions used in this study were blinded to treatment allocation.

Fifty-four serious GI events occurred in less than 1 percent of any treatment group, meaning that all numbers needed to treat to harm would be more than 100. Significantly fewer GI events occurred in patients receiving the
7. 5-mg dosage of meloxicam compared with each of the other NSAIDs. At the 15-mg dosage, the risk with meloxicam was significantly less than the risk with piroxicam only. Thromboembolic events were less frequent with either dosage of meloxicam than with diclofenac. There were no differences in the risk of cardiovascular events occurring with meloxicam compared with piroxicam or naproxen, with trends favoring meloxicam. Bottom Line: Short-term meloxicam at the 7. 5-mg daily dosage is less likely than piroxicam, diclofenac, or naproxen to be associated with serious GI complications. However, the absolute risk differences are less than 1 percent.

Meloxicam has not been shown to be associated with heart attacks and strokes. A direct comparison with ibuprofen is needed.

### Piroxicam (Feldene) [^111bPUmh]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Piroxicam capsules, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects).
Piroxicam capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation).
Piroxicam capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain, or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, piroxicam capsules should be avoided because they may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Does multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and patient-controlled analgesia morphine offer advantages over morphine alone? Meta-analyses of randomized trials [^116xdMXc]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

The authors analyzed data from 52 randomized placebo-controlled trials (4,893 adults) testing acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors given in conjunction with morphine after surgery. The median of the average 24-h morphine consumption in controls was 49 mg (range, 15–117 mg); it was significantly decreased with all regimens by 15–55%. There was evidence of a reduction in pain intensity at 24 h (1 cm on the 0- to 10-cm visual analog scale) only with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs also significantly reduced the incidence of nausea/vomiting from 28.8% to 22.0% (number needed to treat, 15) and of sedation from 15.4% to 12.7% (number needed to treat, 37) but increased the risk of severe bleeding from 0% to 1.7% (number needed to harm, 59). Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors increased the risk of renal failure in cardiac patients from 0% to 1.4% (number needed to harm, 73). A decrease in morphine consumption is not a good indicator of the usefulness of a supplemental analgesic. There is evidence that the combination of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs with patient-controlled analgesia morphine offers some advantages over morphine alone.

Adverse Events

The majority of study subjects (146/181 [80.7%]) experienced ≥ 1 AE, but the overall incidence of subjects with an AE was lower in the meloxicam IV group than in the placebo group (69.9% vs 92.0%) (Table 5). There were no AE-related treatment discontinuations or deaths in either study group. The most commonly reported AEs were nausea, vomiting, hypotension, pruritus, and constipation (Table 6). The majority of events in the meloxicam IV group were of mild (79%) or moderate (20%) intensity. Fewer subjects reported serious AEs (SAEs) in the meloxicam IV group (3 vs 9). The SAEs in the meloxicam IV group were anemia, rectal hemorrhage, and syncope (1 each); SAEs in the placebo group were 2 instances of pulmonary embolism and 1 each of atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac failure, esophageal stenosis, cellulitis, hyponatremia, transient ischemic attack, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis.

Table 6.
Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 3 subjects.

Subjects experienced the following AEs of special interest: bleeding (4.3% vs 3.4%), cardiovascular (0% vs 9.1%), hepatic (3.2% vs 3.4%), renal (1.1% vs 1.1%), thrombotic (0% vs 4.5%), and wound healing (1.1% vs 4.5%). Opioid-related AEs also were experienced by fewer subjects in the meloxicam IV group (48.4% vs 70.5%). The most common AEs typically associated with opioid use were nausea (39.5% vs 59.1%), vomiting (16.1% vs 21.6%), constipation (10.8% vs 12.5%), and dizziness (6.5% vs 5.7%), respectively. No meaningful between-group differences were observed in clinical laboratory tests, including hematology, chemistry, or coagulation parameters.

### Risk of serious upper gastrointestinal and cardiovascular thromboembolic complications with meloxicam [^112vXNAA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk of serious gastrointestinal and thromboembolic complications with approved doses of meloxicam.

Methods

We pooled data from clinical trials of meloxicam at doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/d. A blinded gastrointestinal adjudication committee used prespecified criteria to identify gastric or duodenal perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or hemodynamically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. For analysis of thromboembolic complications, investigator-reported events were analyzed without adjudication.

Results

We analyzed data from 24,196 patients from 28 trials, most of whom had been followed for up to 60 days. Of these patients, 13,118 received meloxicam (10,158 received a daily dose of 7.5 mg and 2960 received 15 mg), 5283 were treated with diclofenac 100 mg, 181 received diclofenac 150 mg, 5371 were treated with piroxicam 20 mg, and 243 received naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Patients who received 7.5 mg of meloxicam daily had a 0.03% risk of serious upper gastrointestinal events, which was significantly lower than the risk in those who received diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam (P < 0.02). With the 15 mg daily dose of meloxicam, this risk was significantly different only when compared with piroxicam (P = 0.03). The risk of thromboembolic events in patients treated with meloxicam at either dose was lower than with diclofenac, but similar to that observed with piroxicam and naproxen.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis of 24,196 patients demonstrates that meloxicam has a favorable gastrointestinal and thromboembolic safety profile. However, only a small number of patients were followed for more than 60 days, and meaningful comparisons were not possible in this subgroup.

### GI-REASONS: a novel 6-month, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial [^116ixyVa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients taking nonstudy analgesics for ≥ 75% of the time was comparable between treatment groups: 13.8% of patients in the celecoxib group (6.8% acetaminophen, 12.8% over-the-counter NSAID, 14.2% opioid) and 14.9% of patients in the nsNSAID group (6.5% acetaminophen, 13.3% over-the-counter NSAID, 15.6% opioid). Approximately 3.5% of celecoxib and 3.0% of nsNSAID patients used aspirin, which was noted as a protocol deviation.

The most commonly used nsNSAIDs were meloxicam (42%), naproxen (21%), diclofenac (20%), and nabumetone (14%), but comparison of celecoxib with any of the individual nsNSAIDs was not conducted, as the study was neither designed nor powered for such comparisons. About one quarter (24.4%) of nsNSAID patients modified their drug regimen (dose changes, switching to another NSAID); 5.4% of celecoxib patients changed their dose. Treatment satisfaction improved from baseline in both groups. However, patients taking celecoxib reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking nsNSAIDs (P < 0.0001).

Overall and cardiovascular safety evaluation

Overall, adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between groups (Table 3). Adjudicated cardiovascular events were similar in both groups (celecoxib 0.4% vs. nsNSAID 0.3%). These included both Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration Combined Endpoint events (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death; eight celecoxib and six nsNSAID events) and cardiovascular events of special interest (unstable angina, coronary revascularization, transient ischemic attacks, venous and peripheral arterial vascular thrombotic events, and congestive heart failure; nine celecoxib and seven nsNSAID events; see Table 4 for more detail). There were seven deaths in total, five in the celecoxib group (three adjudicated as cardiovascular-related) and two in the nsNSAID group (none adjudicated as cardiovascular-related).

### Cardiovascular and bleeding risks associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after myocardial infarction [^113U4yrP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data are available regarding the risk for adverse clinical events with concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment after myocardial infarction (MI).

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the risk for cardiovascular and bleeding events according to groups of antithrombotic medications and subtypes of NSAIDs in patients with MI.

Methods

This was a nationwide cohort study to enroll a study population from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database in Korea between 2009 and 2013. Patients were divided into groups on the basis of the prescribed antithrombotic medications. The primary and secondary outcomes were thromboembolic cardiovascular and clinically relevant bleeding events. The risk for adverse clinical events was assessed by ongoing NSAID treatment and subtypes of NSAIDs.

Results

In total, 108,232 patients (mean age 64.2 ± 12.8 years, 72.1% men, mean follow-up duration 2.3 ± 1.8 years) with first diagnosed MI were enrolled. Concomitant NSAID treatment significantly increased the risk for cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.24 to 6.77; p < 0.001) and bleeding events (HR: 4.08; 95% CI: 3.51 to 4.73; p < 0.001) compared with no NSAID treatment. Among NSAID subtypes, the risk for cardiovascular and bleeding events was lowest with the use of celecoxib (HR: 4.65; 95% CI: 3.17 to 6.82; p < 0.001, and 3.44; 95% CI: 2.20 to 5.39; p < 0.001, respectively) and meloxicam (HR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.68 to 5.47; p < 0.001, and 2.80; 95% CI: 1.40 to 5.60; p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Concomitant NSAID treatment significantly increased the risk for cardiovascular and bleeding events after MI. Although NSAID treatment should be avoided after MI, celecoxib and meloxicam could be considered as alternative options in cases in which NSAID use is unavoidable.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): In patients with spontaneous ICH, regular long-term use of NSAIDs is potentially harmful because of the increased risk of ICH, and given bleeding risks and available alternatives, the regular (eg, daily) use of NSAIDs after an ICH is not recommended. Supporting data note that the use of NSAIDs is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, with large meta-analyses finding increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke with diclofenac and meloxicam and increased risk of ICH with any NSAID use, while one small study in ICH did not find an association for short-term outcomes but follow-up was limited to 90 days.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113cATr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although in vitro COX-2 selectivity is a chemical feature of the NSAID, COX-2 selectivity measured in whole blood following dosing depends on the dose administered.NSAIDs are administered at doses that are not bioequivalent with respect to the extent of inhibition of monocyte COX-2 (which represents a target for drug efficacy) obtained at maximal concentration of drug in the systemic circulation after dosing (C max). In particular, NSAIDs with short half-lives (eg, diclofenac) are often given at higher doses to extend their duration of clinical efficacy (analgesic or anti-inflammatory effect). As shown in Figure 3, diclofenac 50 mg three times daily is associated with a higher inhibitory effect (> 90% inhibition) over 8 hours following dosing compared with other NSAIDs. Different NSAIDs are associated with a differential impact of platelet COX-1 (which represents an index of drug-associated side effects) depending upon their COX isozyme selectivity. Thus, administration of high-dose diclofenac and meloxicam, which have comparable and intermediate COX-2 selectivity in vitro, results in partial inhibition of COX-1. Further, the anti-inflammatory and full analgesic effects of NSAIDs are associated with plasma concentrations that inhibit whole-blood COX-2 activity by 80% (IC 80). Therefore, for drugs such as diclofenac, lowering the dose will lead to circulating concentrations near the COX-2 IC 80 values, which correlate with adequate analgesia while reducing COX-1–mediated side effects.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^115qJR7z]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

However, there are conflicting data reported in the literature: in a national case–control study from Finland, Helin-Salmivaara et al. set out to evaluate the risk of ﬁrst MI associated with the use of NSAIDs in the general population. Over 33 000 patients with ﬁrst-time MI were identiﬁed and the authors found an increased risk of first-time MI with rofecoxib and etoricoxib but not celecoxib. They also found an increased risk with diclofenac, indomethacin, ibuprofen and naproxen.

In 2006, an analysis of non-selective NSAIDs showed that they too may be associated with cardiovascular (CV) risk. McGettigan and Henry conducted a systematic review of observational studies in which they examined cardiovascular (primarily MI) risk of Cox-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs. They looked at 17 patient–control and six cohort studies in a total of nearly 1 million patients, and found that CV risk was increased with rofecoxib as well as with diclofenac, indomethacin and probably meloxicam. Rofecoxib risk was increased at low and high doses, and was evident during the first 30 days of use as well as with long-term treatment. Their analysis showed that there was neither increased nor decreased risk with naproxen, which had previously been thought to be cardioprotective. Although the relative risk (RR) for ibuprofen was not statistically significantly increased compared with that for naproxen, the lower bound of its 95% CI approached 1 (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97, 1.18), which suggests a level of risk (Table 1). In the review, celecoxib showed an increased risk at a dose > 200 mg/day, while risk at 200 mg/day was not increased.

### Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events due to NSAIDs in the diabetic elderly population [^115rD3xx]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

However, beyond the risks from the unavoidable use of aspirin among patients with diabetes with high CV event risk, such patients are at further risk of negative CV outcomes from the use of NSAIDs other than aspirin. The safety profile of different NSAIDs among the group of those at high risk of CV events is not clear and difficult to study by clinical trial due to ethical issues. Furthermore, even though celecoxib was determined to be safe with regard to CV complications, unlike rofecoxib, the association between cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 selectivity and NSAID complications in real-world settings among those at high risk of CV events is an issue that requires further study. Moreover, NSAIDs known to have stronger COX-2 selectivity than celecoxib, such as meloxicam and nimesulide, as well as new COX-2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib, are currently on the market. There are earlier studies looking for an association of aspirin use with CV events among patients with and without diabetes, but none have evaluated the use of other NSAIDs. Therefore, we conducted a cohort study on elderly patients with diabetes to assess GIB and CV outcomes of NSAID users compared to non-users, and to identify differences in the risk of each outcome associated with different kinds of NSAIDs.

### Channelling of patients taking NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors and its effect on interpretation of outcomes [^115kYhAd]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

When new drugs with improved safety or efficacy are introduced, they may be preferentially prescribed to specific populations of patients. Safety and efficacy may be underestimated if such channelling effects are not recognized. Meloxicam and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors were developed as safer alternatives to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies of the use of meloxicam and COX-2-specific inhibitors demonstrate that both of these drugs are being prescribed to patients at increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse drug events. In the case of COX-2-specific inhibitors, this channelling appears to represent a prescribing pattern consistent with current recommendations. Subsequent analysis of the data, after adjusting for channelling bias, showed that the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity for meloxicam was similar to that for other NSAIDs, while COX-2-specific inhibitors reduced the risk of developing gastrointestinal adverse drug events by approximately 60%. These studies serve as examples of observed channelling bias and highlight the need for adjusting for channelling in order to provide a valid assessment of relevant outcomes for drugs likely to be preferentially prescribed to specific populations.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^116UjKWP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^112aprUe]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thus, clinicians and their patients face some dilemmas about how to balance the GI and CV risks, especially in patients known to be at increased risk for both, as occurs in many elderly patients. Cryer, in a submission on behalf of consumers to a 2014 FDA hearing that was contemplating a labeling change based solely on CV risk, emphasized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment: ' In the process of addressing cardiovascular health in the setting of NSAID use, which we applaud, we would not want you to inadvertently increase the risk of other untoward outcomes associated with NSAIDs, such as GI and renal toxicities '.

It is timely to review the area; thus, in a recent article published in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report on a recent consensus meeting that has updated earlier guidelines using more recent information.

The International COX-2 Study Group, a panel of independent physicians and scientists, convened January 28–30, 2005, in Washington, DC, to discuss the issues concerning the cardiovascular (CV) profile of coxibs. The purpose of the meeting was to review potential mechanisms by which inhibition of COX-2 by selective and nonselective NSAID could increase risk of CV events, to evaluate the similarities and differences between drugs based on mechanism and pharmacology, and to propose potential trial methodology to more definitively answer questions regarding cardiovascular risk.

Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and P2Y12 inhibitors — peri-procedural management for interventional pain procedures states that "aspirin and NSAIDs may be continued when the procedure is low-risk pain procedures", but "antiplatelet therapy is discontinued when medium- and high-risk procedures are planned"; for aspirin discontinuation the interval is "6 days for primary prevention (patients with no overt cardiovascular disease) and 4 days for secondary prophylaxis", based on platelet aggregation normalizing with "4 to 6 days"; for NSAIDs, "an interval of 5 half-lives of the NSAID is recommended before the procedure: 1 to 2 days for ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin; 4 days for naproxen and meloxicam; 6 days for nabumetone; and 10 days for oxaprozin and piroxicam", and "Aspirin and NSAIDs can be resumed a day after the procedure"; there is "no significant difference between the guidelines in managing the more potent antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, and prasugrel".

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^113mCNxr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Scarpignato et al. have produced a valuable summary of the current state of knowledge about the GI and CV risks of both nsNSAIDs and COX-2 selective drugs, which will be helpful for clinicians managing patients with osteoarthritis. As they emphasize, there are still uncertainties regarding CV risk profiles of commonly used NSAIDs, and results of some ongoing research directed at this are anticipated.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^117Ljd9e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis", with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong". The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores", that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs", and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo". Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib", "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen", and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen". Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction". Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids". Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip". For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption".

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111y2FcY]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs may be either nonselective in that they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, or selective in that they only inhibit COX-2 (coxibs). The COX-2 selective NSAIDs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, were the first members of the new class to be introduced in the 1990s in an attempt to reduce GI side effects associated with NSAID use. However, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to its association with an increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. Research published in the decade after rofecoxib's market withdrawal attempted to further elucidate the safety of NSAIDs, with an emphasis on determining whether the CV concerns associated with rofecoxib use were a class effect of coxibs. CV risk not only varied among different COX-2 selective NSAIDs (the CV risk was higher for rofecoxib than celecoxib), but when considered overall, serious CV events for nonselective NSAIDs compared with COX-2 selective NSAIDs occurred at approximately equal rates. In some studies, elevated risk was associated with certain nonselective NSAIDs, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the case of diclofenac. Thus, COX-selectivity is not binary, with the COX-2 isoform alone not defining the CV risk of an NSAID. Moreover, NSAIDs have been shown to have differential effects on blood pressure (BP), with rofecoxib, etoricoxib and the nonselective NSAID ibuprofen demonstrating greater increases in systolic BP than celecoxib.–This has obvious implications because hypertension is a known risk factor for CV adverse events. Finally, recent data from the PRECISION trial have shown the noninferiority of celecoxib when compared to ibuprofen and naproxen with regard to CV safety. Ibuprofen and naproxen, in contrast, had greater GI and renal toxicity.

### Nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cardiovascular risk: are they safe? [^114Gf4nG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess possible cardiovascular risks associated with use of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1985 through April 2007 and relevant studies were retrieved.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Peer-reviewed, prospective, double-blind, case-control, and cohort-design studies published in the English language literature were considered eligible for review. Previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews were also analyzed. In total, 17 case-control studies; 9 cohort studies; 1 prospective, double-blind study; 3 meta-analyses; and 1 systematic review of observational studies were identified.

Data Synthesis

Three studies were prospective and the remainder consisted of observational, retrospective studies, with most reporting acute fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction as the cardiovascular endpoint. Among the nonselective NSAIDs, diclofenac appears to pose the highest risk for cardiovascular toxicity; other agents trend toward a neutral effect with respect to cardiovascular risk. Although the data are suggestive, it remains unclear whether naproxen provides protective cardiovascular effects among patients on chronic therapy.

Conclusions

Currently available data are insufficient for defining evidence-based clinical guidelines for the use of NSAIDs, and the need for additional research, specifically randomized controlled trials, is evident. Diclofenac demonstrates a significant risk while naproxen appears to pose the lowest, albeit nonsignificant, risk for cardiovascular morbidity. Although the current clinical evidence may not warrant recommending naproxen as the preferred NSAID treatment, it may be prudent to avoid diclofenac for patients with cardiovascular risk factors requiring NSAID treatment.

### Evaluating the cardiovascular safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113dpnyJ]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Some drugs used to treat noncardiovascular conditions may adversely impact the cardiovascular status of individuals both with and without known cardiovascular disease. When the US Food and Drug Administration judges the potential cardiovascular safety signal to be of sufficient concern, it may require the pharmaceutical manufacturer of the drug in question to conduct a postmarketing (phase 4) randomized controlled trial (RCT). Although historically many phase 4 RCTs focused on efficacy (using a superiority design), contemporary phase 4 RCTs often are focused on safety and use a noninferiority design. The choices made by investigators during the planning stage of a postmarketing phase 4 RCT dedicated to the evaluation of cardiovascular safety can influence the ability to compare the standard and test agents. Multiple factors reflecting the conduct of a phase 4 RCT for a general medical condition may influence interpretation of a cardiovascular safety signal. The higher the rates of failure to adhere to the protocol and dropout from the study, the greater the risk of bias. Trials evaluating the cardiovascular safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when used for arthritis are difficult to conduct and even more challenging to interpret. Concerns include the comparison of drug regimens that do not provide comparable analgesic efficacy and problems with adherence to the protocol and retention in the study. On the basis of phase 4 RCTs of NSAIDs to date, it appears that a comparatively low dose of celecoxib administered to low-risk subjects is associated with approximately the same cardiovascular risk as NSAIDs with less cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity, but at the cost of not controlling arthritic pain as effectively.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^113syhvX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

As Scarpignato et al. note, and a recent FDA hearing concluded, the best evidence should come from a large randomized controlled trial in arthritis patients at high CV risk; such a study is now nearing completion. The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial, which was mandated by the FDA, has recruited more than 20,000 such patients. The last patient follow-up is scheduled for the end of 2015, so results can be anticipated during 2016. This study should give useful, real-world information to increase the evidence base for managing the high CV risk arthritis patient.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125d1Kk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for pain and inflammation but are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. While this risk is well established, most studies evaluate NSAIDs as a homogenous class, limiting clinical decision-making based on individual agent safety. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the risk of GI bleeding associated with individual NSAIDs. We searched PubMed from inception through January 2025 using MeSH and free-text terms for "gastrointestinal bleeding" and nine commonly used NSAIDs. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) for GI bleeding, with hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks (RRs) treated as approximations of ORs due to the rare event nature of GI bleeding. Of 6,711 records screened, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Substantial heterogeneity in study design, populations, and outcome ascertainment was observed. Celecoxib was associated with the lowest risk of GI bleeding (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.84–1.61). Among non-selective NSAIDs, ibuprofen had the lowest significant risk (OR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.71–3.03), while ketorolac showed the highest risk (OR 20.67, 95% CI: 14.56–29.34). Other agents, such as piroxicam and meloxicam, also demonstrated significantly elevated risks. The risk of GI bleeding varies widely among individual NSAIDs. Celecoxib appears to have the lowest GI risk, though cardiovascular safety must also be considered. These findings highlight the need for personalized NSAID selection and suggest that NSAIDs should not be treated as a uniform class when assessing bleeding risk.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115yBWuL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review identified 43 studies, comparing 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA at any joint) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants). Topical NSAIDs reduced pain and improved function in patients with OA. Diclofenac patches were the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious AEs were observed in randomised trials or observational studies in the general population. However, confirmation of the CV safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

What is already known on this topic?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis by many guidelines.
There are a number of topical NSAIDs. However, their relative efficacy remains largely unknown because there are few head-to-head comparative trials.
The safety of topical NSAIDs remains unclear, especially its systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events.

What are the new findings?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective to reduce pain and improve function in osteoarthritis.
Among all available topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for pain relief and piroxicam was the best option to improve function.
Other than salicylate gel, topical NSAIDs are safe. They are not associated with increased local or systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal and renal events; this can be concluded from both randomised trials and observational studies.

### Cardiovascular effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^117WtLpe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent and management often involves the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme inhibitors are newer selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that purport to exhibit less gastrointestinal toxicity than traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Cardiotoxicity has been an adverse outcome of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and this article will critically review the evidence.

Recent Findings

Although there is less than perfect evidence, both traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, with the possible exception of naproxen, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are associated with increased thrombotic cardiovascular risk. There is strong evidence supporting the cardiotoxicity of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, but less compelling evidence for the other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Observational studies have been helpful in providing confirmatory and complimentary evidence about this cardiotoxicity. The thrombotic cardiovascular risk begins upon drug introduction, continues throughout exposure and is greatest in patients with a high baseline cardiac risk profile. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are also associated with other nonthrombotic cardiovascular risks.

Summary

The totality of the evidence suggests that all cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiotoxicity. The cardiovascular risks of the different cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are not homogeneous, however, and are likely influenced not only by a class effect, but also by individual drug, dosage and patient characteristics.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^115cpM1M]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications and conclusions

The observation that cardiovascular risk is not clearly associated with specificity of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors implies that no prediction of cardiovascular risk can be made based on such specificity. Therefore the use of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs not covered by our analysis should be reconsidered, as well as the over the counter availability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac or ibuprofen. In general, naproxen seems to be the safest analgesic for patients with osteoarthritis in cardiovascular terms but this advantage has to be weighed against gastrointestinal toxicity and the need for concomitant prescription of a proton pump inhibitor in many patients. In the light of the results of one study, celecoxib 400 mg prescribed once daily may be considered as an alternative option. Other alternatives include paracetamol and opioids. Compared with placebo, however, paracetamol results in only a small reduction in pain and may be associated with clinically relevant hepatotoxicity, even in dosages recommended for musculoskeletal pain. The analgesic effect of opioids is somewhat more pronounced but outweighed by large increases in the risk of adverse events. In conclusion, the options for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain are limited and patients and clinicians need to be aware that cardiovascular risk needs to be taken into account when prescribing.

### An evidence-based review of the cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111y8d1x]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors, are commonly used medications for the relief of acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Because of the extensive use of these agents, adverse events that occur infrequently may still affect the overall risk/benefit ratio of this class of medications. Serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) events have been reported with NSAID use, but unfortunately, definitive evidence regarding the precise CV risk associated with these drugs, as a class and individually, is lacking. Therefore, it is an issue of public health importance that physicians be guided by careful assessment of the existing evidence to make reasonable choices in prescribing these medications. The investigators review the key clinical trials, meta-analyses of clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies on the subject of the CV safety of NSAIDs and identify key variables that define the CV risk of the NSAIDs. In conclusion, it is important that cardiologists, who are not among those physicians frequently prescribing NSAIDs, have a particular responsibility to have up-to-date, thoughtfully synthesized information about the CV risks of these drugs, especially when administered to patients receiving low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection.

### Identifying risk factors for cardiovascular events among active-duty service members and veterans prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [^116b9eDk]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 237,852 patients with a claim of a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, non-fatal cerebrovascular accident, or new heart failure) during the study period. During the study period, 231,967 patients had a pharmacy claim for an NSAID and encounter data for at least 6 months prior to the cardiovascular event (index date). Among those who received an NSAID prescription from VA/DoD during the study period, 2,319,670 patients without cardiovascular events who met selection criteria (see Figure 1) were assigned as controls.

Figure 1
Consort diagram.

Descriptive Analysis

Median age of cases was 69 and controls 49. As shown in Table 2, cases were more likely than controls to be older, black or other than white race, or male sex.

Table 1
Diagnostic Codes for Cardiovascular Events and Predefined Risk Factors

Table 2
Baseline Demographics & Predefined Risk Factors

Compared with controls, patients with cardiovascular events were more likely to have high disease burdens. As shown in Table 1, cases had significantly higher frequency of diagnosed conditions including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, arthritis, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, atherothrombotic disease, history of tobacco use, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and liver dysfunction. In addition to disease comorbidity, cases also reported higher frequency of previous cardiovascular events specifically history of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident.

VA/DoD prescription data indicated a higher percentage of cases receiving aspirin and anticoagulants compared to controls. COX-2 and non-selective NSAIDs were prescribed more often in cases, but COX-1 selective NSAIDs were prescribed more often in controls driven by ibuprofen which was prescribed more frequently in controls. All other individual NSAIDs were prescribed more frequently in cases including celecoxib, diclofenac, etodolac, indomethacin, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, sulindac, and several others with low prescription counts for both cases and controls. NSAIDs were prescribed more frequently across low/medium and high doses tracked.

### Ischaemic colitis in a patient taking meloxicam [^116mUVck]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The safety of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) preferential inhibitors such as meloxicam is debated. We describe a patient who presented with bloody diarrhoea after 15 mg meloxicam daily for 10 days for osteoarthritis. The endoscopic and histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of ischaemic colitis. Symptoms and endoscopic lesions quickly regressed within 1 week of meloxicam withdrawal. There was no evidence of another cause of colonic ischaemia. We suggest that meloxicam might have intestinal toxic effects when taken in high doses, because of reduced COX-2 selectivity.

### Cardiovascular risk and inhibition of cyclooxygenase: a systematic review of the observational studies of selective and nonselective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 [^111zr1yf]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence that rofecoxib increases the risk of myocardial infarction has led to scrutiny of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Regulatory agencies have provided variable advice regarding the cardiovascular risks with older nonselective NSAIDs.

Objective

To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies to compare the risks of serious cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted of electronic databases (1985–2006), scientific meeting proceedings, epidemiological research Web sites, and bibliographies of eligible studies.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were of case-control or cohort design, reported on cardiovascular events (predominantly myocardial infarction) with cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, NSAID use, or both with nonuse/remote use of the drugs as the reference exposure. Of 7086 potentially eligible titles, 17 case-control and 6 cohort studies were included. Thirteen studies reported on cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, 23 on NSAIDs, and 13 on both groups of drugs.

Data Extraction

Two people independently extracted data and assessed study quality with disagreements resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined using a random-effects model. A dose-related risk was evident with rofecoxib, summary relative risk with 25 mg/d or less, 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.79) and 2.19 (95% CI, 1.64–2.91) with more than 25 mg/d. The risk was elevated during the first month of treatment. Celecoxib was not associated with an elevated risk of vascular occlusion, summary relative risk 1.06 (95% CI, 0.91–1.23). Among older nonselective drugs, diclofenac had the highest risk with a summary relative risk of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16–1.70). The other drugs had summary relative risks close to 1: naproxen, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.07); piroxicam, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.70–1.59); and ibuprofen, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97–1.18).

Conclusions

This review confirms the findings from randomized trials regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with rofecoxib and suggests that celecoxib in commonly used doses may not increase the risk, contradicts claims of a protective effect of naproxen, and raises serious questions about the safety of diclofenac, an older drug.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^1168c4gB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The second issue worthy of comment is the conclusion the consensus group reached about whether some NSAIDs are safer than others from the standpoint of CV risk. Statement 8 reads: ' The risk of CV events associated with celecoxib use is similar to that associated with the use of most ns-NSAIDs'. Eighty-four percent of the panel agreed strongly or moderately, although only just over half the panel rated the level of evidence as high. They did not endorse earlier strong recommendations from bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Gastroenterology that naproxen should be the NSAID of choice for patients with high CV risk. Instead, the treatment-guidance algorithm they propose allows either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib as the preferred agents in patients with high CV risk, adding in a PPI to either if patients are judged to also be at high GI risk.

As Scarpignato et al. indicate, the evidence about whether naproxen has a lower CV risk has been conflicting; there is some pharmacokinetic basis to suspect it might. Aspirin exerts its prolonged anti-platelet effect because it irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase. However, other nsNSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, so their platelet inhibitory effect disappears as their plasma levels dissipate. Naproxen is one of the longer acting nsNSAIDs, with a plasma elimination half-life of about 14 hours; a small study of volunteers given a single dose of 1,000 mg found platelet aggregation still reduced after 24 hours in 60% of cases. Thus, it is plausible that twice daily dosing may offer some protection against thrombotic events.

Seemingly in support of this, a recent large meta-analysis (the CNT collaboration) found that a coxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen increased the rate of major vascular events by about a third (not quite significant for ibuprofen), but naproxen did not. However, a meta-analysis is only as strong as its component parts, and a particular weakness of the CNT meta-analysis was that it had to indirectly compare the effects of the different drugs. That is to say, studies of drug A versus drug B were combined with studies of drug A versus placebo to estimate relative risks for drug B versus placebo.

### Comparison of the incidence rates of thromboembolic events reported for patients prescribed rofecoxib and meloxicam in general practice in england using prescription-event monitoring (PEM) data [^115WLAwB]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Rofecoxib and meloxicam are classified as cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors. The Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) monitored the post-marketing safety of these drugs in England using the non-interventional observational cohort technique of prescription-event monitoring (PEM).

Objectives

To compare the incidence rates of selected thromboembolic (TE)(cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral venous thrombotic) events reported for patients prescribed rofecoxib and meloxicam in general practice.

Methods

Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions written by general practitioners (GPs) for meloxicam (December 1996 to March 1997) and rofecoxib (July to November 1999). Simple questionnaires requesting details of events recorded during/after treatment, indication and potential risk factors (including age, sex and NSAIDs prescribed within 3 months of treatment) were posted to prescribing GPs approximately 9 months after the first prescription for each patient. Incidence rates of the first event within each TE group were calculated; crude and age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios (RR) obtained using regression modelling.

Results

During the 9 months after starting treatment, 21 (0.14%) and 19 (0.10%) patients were reported to have cardiovascular TE events, and 74 (0.48%) and 52 (0.27%) cerebrovascular TE events, and 6 (0.05%) and 20 (0.10%) were reported to have peripheral venous thrombotic events for rofecoxib and meloxicam, respectively. Regarding time to first event, there was a persistent divergence between the two drugs from the start of treatment for both the cerebrovascular TE event group (log rank test P = 0.0063) and the peripheral venous thrombotic event group (log rank test P = 0.0264). Indication and use of a NSAID within 3 months prior to starting treatment had no statistically significant effect on the relative risk estimates of the event groups and was excluded from subsequent analyses. Adjusting for the two identified risk factors of age (age2) and sex, for rofecoxib the adjusted cerebrovascular TE event group rate was higher than for meloxicam [RR 1.68 (95% CI 1.15, 2.46)]; lower than meloxicam for the peripheral venous thrombotic event group [RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.11, 0.78)], and not different for the cardiovascular TE event group [RR 1.38 (95% CI 0.71, 2.67)].

Conclusions

This study reports a relative increase in the rate of cerebrovascular TE events and a relative reduction in peripheral venous thrombotic events in users of rofecoxib compared with meloxicam. There was no difference in the rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events. The incidence of these three groups of events reported in each of these two drug cohorts was low (less than 0.5%), therefore the relevance of our findings needs to be taken into consideration with other clinical and pharmacoepidemiological studies.

### Time dependent risk of gastrointestinal complications induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use: a consensus statement using a meta-analytic approach [^117SFPa4]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated document assessing the global, NSAID-specific, and time dependent risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications through meta-analyses of high quality studies.

Methods

An exhaustive systematic search was performed. Inclusion criteria were: RCT or controlled study, duration of 5 days at least, inactive control, assessment of minor or major NSAID adverse effects, publication range January 1985 to January 2003. The publications retrieved were assessed during a specifically dedicated WHO meeting including leading experts in all related fields. Statistics were performed conservatively. Meta-regression was performed by regressing NSAID adjusted estimates against study duration categories.

Results

Among RCT data, indolic derivates provided a significantly higher risk of GI complications related to NSAID use than for non-users: RR = 2.25 (1.00; 5.08) than did other compounds: naproxen: RR = 1.83 (1.25; 2.68); diclofenac: RR = 1.73 (1.21; 2.46); piroxicam: RR = 1.66 (1.14; 2.44); tenoxicam: RR = 1.43 (0.40; 5.14); meloxicam: RR = 1.24 (0.98; 1.56), and ibuprofen: RR = 1.19 (0.93; 1.54). Indometacin users had a maximum relative risk for complication at 14 days. The other compounds presented a better profile, with a maximum risk at 50 days. Significant additional risk factors included age, dose, and underlying disease. The controlled cohort studies provided higher estimates: RR = 2.22 (1.7; 2.9). Publication bias testing was significant, towards a selective publication of deleterious effects of NSAIDs from small sized studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis characterised the "compound" and "time" aspects of the GI toxicity of non-selective NSAIDs. The risk/benefit ratio of such compounds should thus be carefully and individually evaluated at the start of long term treatment.

### Comparison of the incidence rates of thromboembolic events reported for patients prescribed celecoxib and meloxicam in general practice in england using prescription-event monitoring (PEM) data [^115GdqUX]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Celecoxib and meloxicam are classified as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors. The Drug Safety Research Unit monitored the post marketing safety of these drugs in England using the non-interventional observational cohort technique of Prescription-Event Monitoring (PEM).

Objectives

To compare the incidence rates of selected thromboembolic (TE) (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral venous thrombotic) events reported for patients prescribed celecoxib and meloxicam in general practice.

Methods

Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions written by general practitioners (GPs) for meloxicam (December 1996-March 1997) and celecoxib (May and December 2000). Simple questionnaires requesting details of events occurring during/after treatment, indication and potential risk factors (including age, sex and whether NSAIDs had been prescribed within 3 months of treatment) were posted to prescribing GPs at least 6 months after the first prescription for each patient. Incidence rates of the first event were calculated; crude and adjusted rate ratios (RRs) were obtained using Poisson regression modelling.

Results

During the 9 months after starting treatment, 28 (0.16%) and 19 (0.10%) of patients were reported to have experienced cardiovascular TE events, 68 (0.39%) and 52 (0.27%) cerebrovascular TE events, and 17 (0.10%) and 20 (0.10%) experienced peripheral venous thrombotic events for celecoxib and meloxicam, respectively. Regarding time to first event, there was a persistent divergence between the two drugs from 30 days after the start of treatment for both the cardiovascular TE event group (log rank test P = 0.0153) and cerebrovascular TE event group (log rank test P = 0.0055). Indication and use of an NSAID within 3 months prior to starting treatment had no effect on the relative risk estimates of the event groups and was excluded in subsequent analyses. Adjusting for the two identified risk factors of age (age2) and sex, the cerebrovascular TE event group rate was higher for celecoxib than for meloxicam, RR 1.66 (95% CI 1.10–2.51), over the study period and no different for the cardiovascular TE event group, RR 1.72 (95% CI 0.87–3.40) or peripheral venous thrombotic group, RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.51–2.19).

Conclusions

This study reports a relative increase in the rate of cerebrovascular TE events in users of celecoxib compared to meloxicam. There was no difference in the rate of cardiovascular TE events or peripheral venous thrombotic events between users of these two drugs. The incidence of these three groups of events reported in each of these two drug cohorts was low (< 0.5%), therefore the relevance of our findings need to be taken into consideration with other clinical and pharmacoepidemiological studies.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^114NoXPY]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In a recently published article in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato and colleagues present the results of a consensus conference that addressed several aspects of the management of pain in patients with osteoarthritis. The main areas covered include the relative safety in regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events of non-selective 'traditional' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs. The role of co-therapy with proton pump inhibitors in enhancing gastrointestinal safety is also reviewed.

This commentary focuses on two areas that the consensus conference addressed, i) the whole length of gastrointestinal tract risk profile of the various NSAIDs (not just the ulcer risks in stomach and duodenum); ii) more recent information, but still some uncertainties, about the cardiovascular risks associated with the two classes of NSAID in general, and naproxen in particular.

Medication management — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults — NSAIDs are known to have increased side effects in the older adult; limit the length of NSAID courses and use the lowest effective dose. Avoid NSAIDs in older adults with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, reduced cardiac output, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, hepatic impairment, or anticoagulation. Traditional NSAIDs reversibly inhibit platelet function and may alter the cardioprotective effects of aspirin, and their use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants decreases platelet function in an additive manner; an increased risk of gastropathy is present, and pharmacologic gastroprotection is indicated. COX-2 selective agents are not associated with platelet dysfunction, but the patient may need gastroprotection if on concurrent low-dose aspirin.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116PpqFg]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Concerns have also been raised that the use of opiates may delay gastric and intestinal absorption of orally administered P2Y12 inhibitors, thereby delaying their pharmacodynamic effects in patients undergoing PCI, although the clinical relevance of these pharmacodynamic findings remains disputed. Use of nonaspirin NSAIDs should be avoided for management of suspected or known ischemia pain whenever possible, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with increased risk of MACE in patients with and without prior cardiac disease, with no documented benefit to support routine use in patients with ACS.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently used medications. NSAIDs profoundly modify prostaglandin homeostasis through inhibition of the enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX), especially COX-2. COX-2 inhibition is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes as demonstrated by recent trials using this type of drug. This review explores the latest available data, including recent, randomized, clinical trials, controversies, and pathophysiology of the adverse effects of COX-inhibition.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular risk [^113Uk6xF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which exist in at least two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin and older agents in this class are nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2. Newer agents termed "coxibs" are selective inhibitors of COX-2. Among the NSAID, only aspirin has been proven to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk, primarily through inhibition of COX-1-mediated platelet aggregation. It has been suggested that other nonselective agents, especially naproxen, may provide some lesser degree of cardioprotection, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Conversely, there are concerns that the COX-2 inhibitors may increase cardiovascular risk. However, mechanisms for this potentially adverse cardiovascular effect are unknown, and it is becoming increasingly clear that our understanding of the role of COX-2 in cardiovascular function is incomplete. Some studies have demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of COX-2 on cardiovascular function that could be negated by COX-2 inhibition, while other studies have reported improved endothelial function with COX-2 inhibitors. Additionally, the impact of combined therapy with aspirin and other COX inhibitors is not yet clear. This article will review the studies that have examined these issues.

### Recommendations for the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular disease risk: decades later, any new lessons learned? [^112KyYiH]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most prescribed pharmacologic therapies worldwide due to their therapeutic analgesic efficacy and relative tolerability. In the past several decades, various cardiovascular (CV) adverse events have emerged regarding both traditional NSAIDs (tNSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective (coxibs). This review will provide an updated report on the CV risk profile of NSAIDs, focusing on several of the larger clinical trials, meta-analyses, and registry studies. We aim to provide rheumatologists with a framework for NSAID use in the context of rheumatologic chronic pain management. Recent findings: In patients with and without CV diseases, the use of NSAIDs, both tNSAIDs and coxibs, is associated with an increased risk of adverse CV events, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events. These CV risks have increased within weeks of coxib use and higher doses of tNSAIDs. The risk of adverse CV events is heterogenous across NSAIDs; naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen appear to have lower increased CV risk among NSAIDs. A variation in CV risk is associated with multiple factors, including NSAID class, COX-2 selectivity, treatment dose and duration, and baseline patient risk. Summary: Many important questions remain regarding the safety of NSAIDs and whether the culmination of research performed could inform us whether specific patient subtypes or NSAID class may have a more favorable profile. tNSAIDs such as naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen may have a lower CV risk profile, while coxibs have a more favorable GI risk profile. In general, any NSAID can be optimized if used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time, especially among individuals with increased CV risk.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in total joint arthroplasty: the clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^112Mphh5]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with placebo: Oral or IV NSAIDs administered preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively do not appear to increase the risk of medical complications following primary TJA, and providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Among randomized clinical trials comparing perioperative oral NSAIDs and placebo, twelve studies reported on medical complications, and qualitative examination demonstrated no consistent difference between oral selective COX-2 agents (including Celecoxib and Meloxicam), oral non-selective NSAIDs, and placebo, with the exception of a lower incidence of postoperative fever with patients receiving an oral NSAID.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^112uzgdr]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Latest clinical trial data

Relevant studies that have been published since the last consensus document in this field are the PRECISIONand CONCERNclinical trials and a meta-analysis of individual patient data authored by Bally et al. The PRECISION trial was the first study of NSAIDs in high-CV-risk patients and the first to compare a c2s agent with naproxen and ibuprofen. All three NSAIDs provided effective pain relief in patients with OA or RA (with no clinically significant differences between groups). Celecoxib was noninferior to naproxen and ibuprofen for the primary CV-event end point and was associated with significantly fewer GI and serious renal events compared with the ns-NSAIDs.

The focus of the CONCERN study was adverse GI events. The trial included patients with arthritis who also had cardiothrombotic diseases requiring low-dose aspirin and a history of upper-GI-tract bleeding. Subjects were randomized to celecoxib 100 mg twice daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily, both in combination with a prophylactic proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). The primary end point was recurrent upper-GI-tract bleeding within 18 months. The cumulative incidence of primary end-point events with celecoxib was less than half that with naproxen. The rate of serious CV events (a secondary end point of the trial) did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. The key features and results of the PRECISION and CONCERN studies, along with the earlier MEDAL program that looked at long-term use of etoricoxib, are summarized in Table 1.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^115Sc2NG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of degenerative joint disease provides patients with an improved quality of life and better functional status; however, the procedure can result in moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. Historically, opioid medications have been the cornerstone of postoperative analgesia after TKA, but our improved understanding of pain physiology and transmission helped to usher in the era of multimodal analgesia. The premise of multimodal analgesia is to use nonnarcotic medications such as acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), among others, to reduce opioid-related adverse effects while providing improved pain management. For example, the tissue damage during TKA causes the release of arachidonic acid, the precursor to prostaglandins, resulting in a hyperalgesiac response from the peripheral nerves. Because NSAIDs block the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, causing a subsequent reduction in the hyperalgesiac response, NSAIDs can be used to reduce postoperative pain as an alternative to opioid medications.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are categorized based on their ability to selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform that is responsible for the production of prostiglandins. Nonselective NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) provide relatively equivalent inhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms while selective COX-2 NSAIDs are subcategorized as highly selective (eg, celecoxib) and preferentially selective (eg, meloxicam) COX-2 NSAIDs. Although meloxicam does have a preference for binding with COX-2, it also inhibits COX-1 at the higher dosage regimens of 15 mg daily. Because COX-1 is constitutively expressed throughout the body and plays a role in platelet function, protection of gastric mucosa, and renal function, it resulted in the development of the selective and preferentially selective COX-2 NSAIDs with the intention to limit the negative effect of COX-1 inhibition. Nevertheless, realizing the full benefit of highly selective COX-2 inhibition while avoiding the complications associated with COX-1 inhibition has not come to fruition.

The purpose of this study was to compare the complication rates related to COX-1 inhibition between those who receive either a nonselective (meloxicam 15 mg/d), preferential COX-2 (meloxicam 7.5 mg/d) or a highly selective COX-2 (celecoxib) NSAID after primary TKA and determine whether meloxicam, at a dose of 15 mg/d, is more cost-effective when considering the potential cost of increased complications related to COX-1 inhibition.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^114tjZrc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of cardiovascular safety data of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and placebo, naproxen seemed least harmful (fig 3). Safety profiles of individual drugs varied considerably depending on the outcome, and estimated rate ratios for comparisons with placebo were generally imprecise. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are mainly used for symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Clearly, as for any symptomatic treatment, doing more harm than good with this class of drugs should be avoided (primum non nocere). Taking this into account, we presented confidence levels (fig 4), which can be interpreted as confidence that a drug is associated with an increase in risk that is smaller than a specified threshold. For the primary outcome of myocardial infarction, the confidence that the increase in risk associated with the evaluated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not exceed 30% (the risk increase used as non-inferiority margin in the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term programme) is sufficiently high only for naproxen. Conversely, we are confident that several other drugs — ibuprofen, diclofenac, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib — are associated with a risk increase of more than 30% on several cardiovascular outcomes.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pancreatic cancer risk: a nested case-control study [^115StMbB]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Ever use of aspirin was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk in our study, which is not unexpected as the majority of aspirin users (83%) used low-dose aspirin only (< 300 mg) and data from cohort studies and large trials have not shown any decrease in pancreatic cancer risk in users of low-dose aspirin. Use of greater than five aspirin tablets per week (high dose, 325 mg) for 10 years or more in the Nurses' Health Study was associated with an increased the risk of pancreatic cancer compared with those who used aspirin for 1–5 years. Data from the two large randomised trials, with reliable post trial follow-up for more than 20 years, also suggested that high-dose aspirin may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer slightly. We did not see any increase in risk in subjects using high-dose aspirin but we were unable to assess risk in long-term users of high-dose aspirin as only 17% used this dose at any time.

Ever versus never use of COX-2 inhibitors and oxicams was associated with modest reductions in pancreatic cancer risk (20% and 30%, respectively) but statistical significance was not achieved and too few subjects took these preparations to allow a more detailed analysis of use of these drugs. Trials of COX-2 inhibitors in patients with colorectal adenomas or previous colorectal cancer have shown that these drugs can successfully prevent colorectal carcinogenesis but adverse effects on cardiovascular risk mean that they are also unlikely to be of benefit for the prevention of cancer, especially if a high-risk pre-malignant state is not clearly recognised. Meloxicam has been described as a preferential COX-2 inhibitor and as with piroxicam has shown inhibitory actions on human cancers. This is the first study to report on the use of oxicams and pancreatic cancer prevention and further analysis is warranted.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^113QFjo4]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results

Thirty one randomised controlled trials evaluating seven different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in the analyses (table 1, fig 1). Celecoxib was investigated most (15 trials) and compared with five different interventions. Ibuprofen was evaluated least (two trials) and compared with two different interventions, whereas etoricoxib was evaluated in three trials but compared with only one intervention. Etoricoxib and diclofenac had the largest number of patient years of follow-up (26 025 and 27 819 overall, respectively), whereas ibuprofen had the lowest number of patient years of follow-up (4832 overall). In total, 116 429 patients with 117 218 patient years of follow-up were covered in the analysis of the primary outcome (table 2). The methodological quality of included trials was generally high with all but two having adequate concealment of allocation, all having adequate blinding of patients and investigators, 16 having independent event adjudication, and 13 including all randomised patients in the analysis (table 1).

### Ketoprofen [^112uNrH7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of Ketoprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)].

Avoid the use of Ketoprofen capsules in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Ketoprofen capsules are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ketoprofen capsules, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

### An evidence-based approach to prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. third Canadian consensus conference [^111Segs8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To revisit our previous evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs).

Methods

Needs assessments were conducted among Canadian physicians to determine their educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the consensus meeting, held January 21–23, 2005, participants discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration, February 16–18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June 9–10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1) Patients should be fully informed about treatment options, including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited, coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI.

Conclusion

Coxibs continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment. This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients' risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.

### Primer: managing NSAID-induced ulcer complications – balancing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^112NykmF]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ulcer complications associated with the use of NSAIDs, in high-risk patients, are often caused by a failure to identify patients' risk factors, concomitant use of aspirin or multiple NSAIDs, and underutilization of gastroprotective agents. Current data suggest that cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors and some nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Physicians must, therefore, take into account both the gastrointestinal and the cardiovascular risks of individual patients when prescribing NSAIDs. In patients with a low cardiovascular risk, NSAIDs can be prescribed according to the level of gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a moderate gastrointestinal risk (one or two risk factors) should receive a COX2 inhibitor or an NSAID plus a PPI or misoprostol. Patients with more than two gastrointestinal risk factors or prior ulcer complications require the combination of a COX2 inhibitor and a PPI. Patients with a high cardiovascular risk (e.g. coronary heart disease or an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 10%) should receive prophylactic aspirin and combination therapy with a PPI or misoprostol irrespective of the presence of gastrointestinal risk factors. Naproxen is the preferred NSAID because it is not associated with excess cardiovascular risk. Patients with a high cardiovascular risk and a very high gastrointestinal risk should avoid using NSAIDs or COX2 inhibitors.

Conclusion

The overall experience with tNSAIDs in our study is generally congruent with a neutral effect on cardiovascular disease although there is a suggestion of a small excess risk with chronic exposure, especially for non-fatal MI. The summary estimate for the tNSAID group is composed of substantial variation in risk between the three studied individual tNSAIDs suggesting a biologically plausible heterogenity in cardiovascular risk. Our study suggests either no effect or a small reduction of cardiovascular risk during sustained treatment with naproxen, a small increased risk with diclofenac, and an undetectable risk with ibuprofen. Larger observational studies and, if at all possible, randomised clinical trials will be necessary to address this hypothesis of mechanistic heterogenity amongst tNSAIDs with respect to cardiovascular risk.

### FDA labeling of NSAIDs: review of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cardiovascular disease [^1134Wzhe]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been extensively used worldwide for both chronic and acute musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions. Extensive evidence has linked NSAID use with adverse cardiovascular events. This review article aims to review the existing evidence on the risk of cardiovascular and coronary events in both selective and nonselective NSAIDs, the time course of NSAIDs associated with cardiovascular risk, and specific populations that may be at increased risk.

### Cardiovascular risk and COX-2 inhibition in rheumatological practice [^111bbVA2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The use of specific COX-2 inhibitors in place of standard nonsteroidals for the treatment of arthritis appears to reduce the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity in this group of patients. However, the role played by these inhibitors in the generation or exacerbation of ischaemic cardiovascular disease is less clear. Clinical studies demonstrate that hypertension can be induced or aggravated by COX-2 inhibitors to a degree similar to that which occurs with standard nonsteroidals. Endothelial dysfunction, an indicator of cardiac ischaemia, may also be exacerbated by specific COX-2 inhibition and there is much debate as to whether these changes lead to an absolute increase in ischaemic cardiac events. These effects on cardiovascular risk factors appear all the more important in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where there is an increase in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease. Here we review the available data on COX-2 inhibition and cardiovascular disease and conclude that all patients who started these agents should have a careful assessment and modification of any cardiovascular risk factors.
