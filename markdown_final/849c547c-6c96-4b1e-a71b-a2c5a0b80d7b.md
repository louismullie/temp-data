## Question

Treatment for lichen sclerosos

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for lichen sclerosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing core treatment principles and risks. Then, I should verify first-line therapy specifics and dosing regimens. Next, I will review maintenance strategies and adjunctive skin care. After that, I need to examine second-line options for refractory disease. I will then consider pediatric nuances, surgical indications, and follow-up and biopsy thresholds. Finally, I should reconcile differences across guidelines and synthesize an integrated, pragmatic algorithm that reflects the evidence and expert guidance.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't miss the big picture. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory condition with no cure; goals are symptom control, prevention of scarring and architectural change, and mitigation of malignant transformation risk, which is commonly cited in the 2–6% range for vulvar SCC over a lifetime, warranting long-term surveillance and experienced care teams managing patients across dermatology, gynecology, urology, or trained primary care settings [^112hfLuL] [^116SL6W9] [^113MdKLw] [^115YoK7V].

> Wait, let me verify first-line medical therapy because this anchors everything else. Multiple high-credibility guidelines align that ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are first-line for anogenital LS, with clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1% as preferred agents, and EADV 2022 reinforces proactive use while BASHH 2025 provides a practical taper over 12 weeks with review at 3 months; importantly, 30 g of ultra-potent steroid should last at least 3 months, which helps calibrate safe quantities and counters steroid phobia [^116ZawHT] [^115kpLbT] [^116UREav] [^1147Z9TH] [^114bny4A] [^112Za6QS] [^113jEYrM].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation and skin care because vehicle and irritant avoidance materially affect outcomes. Ointment bases are preferred over creams to minimize preservatives and contact dermatitis, and all patients should receive emollients as soap substitutes and barrier agents while avoiding vulval irritants and mechanical triggers, with counseling to reduce excessive cleansing and tight synthetic clothing that can perpetuate trauma and inflammation [^114sJGMt] [^114boKtE] [^114LhfJa] [^112Za6QS] [^111S1KWK] [^114Zu6n9].

> Let me consider maintenance therapy carefully, because relapse is common and the surveillance horizon is long. Proactive twice-weekly clobetasol 0.05% or mometasone 0.1% is endorsed to maintain remission and may help reduce malignant change risk; titration based on disease activity is reasonable when stable, and ACOG supports individualized long-term regimens to normalize color and texture and prevent scarring; I should note that high relapse rates are reported in long-term cohorts and pediatrics, underscoring the need for maintenance and follow-up, though those supporting data are lower quality and should be interpreted cautiously [^113jEYrM] [^117PyZzR] [^114Xgb69] [^116QJVLm] [^113YD3Ss] [^115QKoGj].

> I need to check second-line pathways for refractory or steroid-intolerant cases so I can escalate prudently. Topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus are reasonable when steroids are unsuitable or insufficient, with pediatric preference for tacrolimus 0.03%; use with caution given theoretical malignancy concerns in a precancerous dermatosis, though guideline endorsements exist; beyond TCIs, options include intralesional triamcinolone for hyperkeratotic steroid-resistant foci after biopsy excludes neoplasia, photodynamic therapy for vulvar disease though it is painful and time-consuming, and systemic retinoids in specialist hands for recalcitrant disease; notably, an arm-based network meta-analysis suggests clobetasol remains top-ranked with tacrolimus close behind for remission probability, informing expectations when switching classes [^112oH3hQ] [^112oH3hQ] [^116cGNvp] [^116EtEeW] [^113KWdTB] [^115kBu1z] [^117GhLs5] [^113D3myU] [^117XifKD] [^115BPaiU] [^114T64e9] [^113PsD7T].

> But wait, what about pediatric-specific management nuances, I should confirm those distinctly. Pediatric females can follow the same clobetasol 3-month taper with emollients and then consider tacrolimus 0.03% twice weekly for maintenance to reduce recurrences; pediatric males with phimosis not responding to 1–3 months of potent-ultra potent steroids should be referred for circumcision, with attention to meatal stenosis and timing of follow-up, and many children will still require careful long-term monitoring given recurrence risks and limited high-quality pediatric data [^115GxUZm] [^113KWdTB] [^1144BgGe] [^114dwWoE] [^113PLgby] [^114ohJ4A] [^115QKoGj].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and principles in females, because medical therapy alone does not reverse all architectural change. Indications include functional impairment such as dyspareunia from introital stenosis or synechiae after optimized medical care, where carefully selected procedures (de-adhesiolysis, perineotomy, perineoplasty or Z-plasty) may restore function; these should be combined with perioperative anti-inflammatory treatment and postoperative dilation or early resumption of intercourse to reduce restenosis risk [^116aEvkQ] [^117WHVHB].

> I will now examine surgical considerations in males to ensure completeness. When disease is confined to the foreskin and glans and fails guideline-recommended steroids, circumcision with complete foreskin removal is preferred, with histopathologic evaluation to confirm LS and exclude dysplasia, and pre- and postoperative topical steroid courses improve outcomes; for distal urethral involvement, urethroplasty with oral mucosal grafts is favored over skin, and selected cases may need glans resurfacing or procedures addressing clitoral phimosis analogs in females for symptomatic relief, all in experienced hands [^114U2Ehc] [^117Tuj1A] [^116A3GpX] [^112m46ZB] [^113TtxqT].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence, biopsy thresholds, and patient education, because missing neoplasia is a key hazard. Early after induction, reviews every 1–6 months until stability, then annual visits, are recommended, and in quiescent, uncomplicated cases with confident self-management, annual primary care review is acceptable; biopsy is warranted for persistent hyperkeratosis, erosions, erythema, new papules or warty lesions, treatment-resistant or pigmented areas, or when escalating to second-line therapy; structured education should cover adherence, trigger avoidance, and red flags for cancer such as nonhealing ulcers and new papules or wart-like lesions [^116SL6W9] [^112NCFo6] [^113n6M1c] [^111zKMoH] [^112NCFo6] [^113Wr7M8].

> Let me think about special circumstances such as extragenital LS, because management differs subtly. For extragenital disease, potent to ultrapotent topical corticosteroids remain first-line and can be used under occlusion in selected sites or combined with topical calcipotriol per EADV guidance, with EDF 2024 likewise supporting potent agents for extragenital involvement [^116UsU2i] [^116waT9h].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "medium-potency" steroids were the universal starting point, but that's not quite right; I should correct and reconcile guidance. European and UK guidelines generally prioritize ultra-potent agents, especially clobetasol, as first-line for genital LS with a defined taper and proactive maintenance, whereas ACOG allows medium- or high-potency options initially, emphasizing individualized long-term control; practical reconciliation is to start with ultra-potent ointment for active genital disease unless contraindicated, consider mometasone if intolerant to clobetasol, and maintain proactive dosing with clear safety messaging that 30 g should last at least 3 months to minimize atrophy risk [^116ZawHT] [^1147Z9TH] [^114bny4A] [^111uPWGF] [^113jEYrM] [^115SyzHo] [^116QJVLm].

> Now, let me integrate this into a cohesive clinical pathway so it's actionable. Begin with clobetasol 0.05% ointment induction once daily for one month, alternate days for one month, then twice weekly for one month, paired with emollient soap substitutes, trigger avoidance, and a 3‑month review; if improved, continue proactive twice-weekly clobetasol or mometasone and then titrate to the lowest effective frequency, with explicit counseling that a 30 g tube should last at least 12 weeks; if disease persists or steroids are unsuitable, add or switch to a TCI (tacrolimus 0.1% adults, 0.03% pediatrics) and consider intralesional triamcinolone for focal hyperkeratosis after biopsy excludes neoplasia, with PDT or systemic retinoids reserved for specialist management in recalcitrant cases; refer males with steroid-refractory phimosis for circumcision with pre/postoperative steroid support and histopathology, and consider targeted female procedures for persistent introital stenosis, all while scheduling follow-up every 1–6 months until stable and annually thereafter, with clear biopsy triggers and cancer-symptom education [^114bny4A] [^112Za6QS] [^113jEYrM] [^112oH3hQ] [^117GhLs5] [^113D3myU] [^117XifKD] [^114U2Ehc] [^117Tuj1A] [^116aEvkQ] [^116SL6W9] [^112NCFo6].

---

First-line treatment for lichen sclerosus is **ultra-potent topical corticosteroids** [^116UREav] (clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1%) applied once daily for 4 weeks, then every other day for 4 weeks, and twice weekly for 4 weeks [^114bny4A], with review at 3 months and individualized maintenance thereafter [^113jEYrM]. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1%) [^112oH3hQ] are reserved for **steroid-intolerant or refractory cases** [^116EtEeW] [^112vfzCm]. Emollients [^114LhfJa] and avoidance of irritants [^114Zu6n9] are **recommended adjuncts**. Circumcision is indicated [^114U2Ehc] for male phimosis unresponsive to medical therapy [^117Tuj1A], and minor vulvar procedures are used for persistent introital stenosis [^117WHVHB]. Regular follow-up is **essential** [^116SL6W9] to monitor response, adherence [^112NCFo6], and malignancy risk [^112NCFo6].

---

## Topical corticosteroids (first-line therapy)

- **First-line therapy**: Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids [^114boKtE] (clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1%) [^113jEYrM] [^114bny4A].

- **Induction regimen**: Apply once daily for 4 weeks, then alternate days for 4 weeks, then twice weekly for 4 weeks [^114bny4A]; review at 3 months and individualize thereafter [^112Za6QS].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Proactive maintenance (e.g. twice weekly) [^113jEYrM] to maintain remission [^117PyZzR] and prevent malignant change.

- **Safety**: Long-term use is generally safe [^113jEYrM] with minimal risk of atrophy or systemic effects [^113YD3Ss].

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors (second-line therapy)

- **Indication**: Use when corticosteroids are unsuitable or ineffective [^116EtEeW] [^112vfzCm].

- **Agents**: Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment [^116EtEeW] or pimecrolimus 1% cream [^112oH3hQ].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for symptom control and maintenance [^116EtEeW], but less effective than corticosteroids for appearance [^113PsD7T].

- **Safety**: Generally safe [^116EtEeW]; transient burning/itching may occur [^112vfzCm].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Emollients**: Use during standard therapy [^114LhfJa] to reduce irritation and restore barrier function [^114sJGMt].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Avoid soaps, detergents, fragrances, and tight clothing [^114Zu6n9] [^111S1KWK].

- **Patient education**: Provide information [^113Wr7M8] on adherence, self-examination, and recognizing progression or malignancy [^112NCFo6].

---

## Surgical interventions

Male circumcision is indicated [^114U2Ehc] for phimosis unresponsive to medical therapy; the complete foreskin should be removed and submitted for histopathology [^117Tuj1A]. Female procedures, such as de-adhesion, synechiolysis, or perineoplasty, are considered when **introital stenosis persists despite medical therapy** [^117WHVHB] [^116aEvkQ].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should occur **every 1–6 months** [^116SL6W9] until stable, then annually [^113n6M1c]. Monitoring should assess response, adherence, and malignancy risk; patients should be encouraged to self-examine [^112NCFo6] and promptly report changes [^112dUbXq].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients should receive **ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids** [^113PLgby]; circumcision is recommended for refractory male phimosis [^11335euE] [^1144BgGe]. For **extragenital LS**, use potent topical corticosteroids [^116waT9h]; consider calcipotriol [^116UsU2i] or acitretin [^114i2Rbv] for refractory disease.

---

Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are **the cornerstone of LS management** [^116UREav], with calcineurin inhibitors as second-line options [^116EtEeW]. Emollients [^114LhfJa], avoidance of irritants [^111S1KWK], and patient education [^112NCFo6] support management. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^117WHVHB]; regular follow-up is essential to monitor response and malignancy risk [^116SL6W9].

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly occurs in adult women, although it may also be seen in men and children. It primarily affects the genital area and around the anus, where it causes persistent itching and soreness. Scarring after inflammation may lead to severe damage by fusion of the vulval lips (labia), narrowing of the vaginal opening, and burying of the clitoris in women and girls. In men and boys, it may cause tightening of the foreskin if treatments are not started early. Affected individuals have an increased risk of genital cancers.

### Lichen sclerosus: A review and practical approach [^111jUSjt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic dermatitis predominantly found in the anogenital area. It can occur in patients of any age group, sex, or race but is most commonly present in Caucasian peri- or postmenopausal women. Although the etiology of LS remains uncertain, an autoimmune process is believed to underlie this condition. With many cases going unreported, the incidence is still unknown.

There is no cure for LS, but treatment offers control of the condition for three primary reasons: relief of symptoms and discomfort, prevention of any or further anatomical changes, and a theoretical prevention of malignant transformation. Although many treatments have been suggested over the years, only potent or ultra-potent corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice. After initial therapy, some patients may use corticosteroids as needed, while others might require twice-weekly maintenance therapy.

Surgery plays no role in uncomplicated LS; it should be limited exclusively to patients with malignancy and to correct scarring secondary to the disease. Lichen sclerosus is associated with a 4–6% risk of squamous cell carcinoma, making long-term follow-up essential in these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^111zKMoH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of lichen sclerosus (LS) is usually clinical. When the clinical features are typical, histologic examination is not always essential. However, in the early stages of the disease, the diagnosis can be difficult. The main differential diagnoses are lichen planus (LP), lichen simplex chronicus, vitiligo, immunobullous disorders such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, and vulvar or penile intraepithelial neoplasia. In clinically inconclusive cases, a histologic examination is advisable and might close the gap but should never be interpreted in isolation.

One-third of men having sufficient symptoms and signs to be clinically diagnosed with LS showed only nonspecific histology on biopsy or in the circumcised prepuce. A nonspecific biopsy does not rule out LS, but classic histologic findings confirm the diagnosis. Patients under routine follow-up will need a biopsy if:

- **Suspicion of neoplastic change**: There is a persistent area of hyperkeratosis, persistent erosion, or erythema, or new warty or papular lesions.
- **Area resistant to adequate treatment**: Despite treatment, the area does not respond.
- **Extragenital LS with overlap features**: Features suggest an overlap with morphea.
- **Pigmented areas**: Exclude an abnormal melanocytic proliferation.
- **Second-line therapy considerations**: Second-line therapy is to be used.

There are instances when it can be impossible to differentiate between LS and LP either on the basis of the clinical or the histologic features. These cases are described as overlap syndrome and often show a poor response to treatment.

### Fractional CO2 laser treatment as adjunctive therapy to topical steroids for managing vulvar lichen sclerosus [^1156Fg76]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The need for second-line or adjunctive therapies to augment topical corticosteroid standard-of-care is well recognized. Medical providers have explored various therapies to address symptoms and active disease. Published accounts reflect variable success in treating recalcitrant VLS with medical therapies, such as intralesional corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, oral or topical retinoids, and immunosuppressors. Surgical modalities are currently the main treatment for architectural changes arising from chronic VLS.

An ideal adjunctive therapy for VLS would augment topical corticosteroid therapy to achieve and maintain remission in recalcitrant cases and address architectural change as a means to improve sexual dysfunction. Studies on fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser as a treatment modality for other vulvovaginal conditions suggest its potential efficacy in treating recalcitrant VLS. In these studies, vaginal treatment with fractional CO2 laser has been shown to reconstitute normal vaginal flora, drive collagenogenesis and tissue remodeling, and alleviate symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Fractional CO2 resurfacing has also been shown to be successful in achieving remission in patients with severe hyperkeratotic VLS that are unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. Following CO2 laser treatment, these patients' VLS became manageable with topical corticosteroid treatment. Significantly, CO2 laser has also been successful in treating clitoral phimosis caused by VLS.

This study assesses the long-term outcome and safety profile of fractional CO2 laser therapy as adjunctive treatment.

### An arm-based network meta-analysis on treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus and a call for development of core outcome sets [^113PsD7T]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present systematic review is to evaluate the available medical treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus, using an arm-based network meta-analysis protocol.

- **Data sources**: We searched Medline (1966–2019), Scopus (2004–2019), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL (1999–2019), Clinicaltrials.gov (2008–2019) databases, and Google Scholar (2004–2019) database along with the reference list of all included studies.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All observational, randomized, and single-arm studies that evaluated medical treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus were considered eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review.

- **Study appraisal**: A network meta-analysis was carried out in R 3.4.3 using the pcnetmeta package, which uses a Bayesian hierarchical model based in Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence simulation.

- **Results**: Sixteen studies were included in this present meta-analysis, which recruited 954 women with vulvar lichen sclerosus. Their quality was evaluated with the JADAD, Cochrane risk of bias, and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions-I tools. Clobetasol treatment ranked as the best treatment for disease remission after evaluating rank probabilities with a 40% chance of ranking first compared with tacrolimus (38%). However, the density plot revealed partial overlapping with tacrolimus. The lowest probability of experiencing a relapse was observed with pimecrolimus (15% [2–48%]); however, the density plot revealed significant overlapping with mometasone furoate, testosterone, and clobetasol.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113DdK1Y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder of genital and extragenital skin. It is a debilitating disease, causing itch, pain, dysuria and restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest an autoimmune-induced disease in genetically predisposed patients, reducing the perceived impact of hormonal factors. Preceding infections may play a provocative role, though the connection with Borrelia remains controversial. Trauma and an occlusive moist environment may also act as precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids are the primary therapeutic options. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered alternatives for patients who fail therapy with ultrapotent corticosteroids or have contraindications to their use. Topical and systemic retinoids may be beneficial in selected cases, while phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS may be options in rare cases refractory to standard treatments. Surgery is limited to addressing scarring that leads to functional impairment. In men, circumcision is effective in most cases, but recurrences are well documented.

Anogenital LS is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review updates the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS affecting both the female and male genitals and extragenital areas.

Regarding patient education for lichen sclerosus, especially with respect to general counseling, EDF 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients on several aspects:

- **Recognition of LS changes**: Identify signs pointing towards disease progression or cancer development, such as ulceration, non-healing lesions, papules, or wart-like lesions.

- **Adherence to treatment**: Understand the importance of sticking to prescribed treatments to help prevent disease progression.

- **Avoidance of trigger factors**: Learn how to avoid specific factors that may exacerbate the condition.

- **Awareness of autoimmune symptoms**: Be aware of symptoms associated with autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113KFEqx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder affecting both genital and extragenital skin. It is a debilitating disease that causes itchiness, pain, dysuria, restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest an autoimmune basis for LS in genetically predisposed patients, moving away from a significant role for hormonal factors. Preceding infections may provoke the condition, although the role of Borrelia remains controversial. Trauma and a moist, occlusive environment can act as precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of LS treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered alternatives for patients who have either failed therapy with ultrapotent corticosteroids or have contraindications for corticosteroid use. Topical and systemic retinoids may be beneficial in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS are considered in rare cases that are refractory to standard treatments.

Surgery is limited to addressing scarring processes that cause functional impairment. In men, circumcision is effective in the majority of cases, though recurrences are documented. Anogenital LS is associated with an elevated risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS affecting female and male genitals and extragenital skin.

### The role of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lichen sclerosus [^115kBu1z]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a propensity to affect the mucocutaneous anogenital area. Topical corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for this condition and constitute an effective therapeutic modality. However, in patients with corticosteroid-resistant disease, when long-term remission is not sustainable, or in those intolerant to these agents, topical calcineurin inhibitors may be considered. Studies have demonstrated their efficacy and tolerability; however, concerns remain with regard to their malignant potential with long-term use. As lichen sclerosus is a potentially precancerous dermatosis, topical calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in this disorder.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115QKoGj]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment practices for lichen sclerosus (LS) in both girls and boys emphasize the importance of using emollients to reduce irritation and restore the skin barrier.

In girls, a systematic review of pediatric LS found that ultrapotent topical corticosteroid ointment, typically clobetasol propionate 0.05% (CP 0.05%), is the most effective treatment for inducing remission, with improvement observed in 99% of patients within 4–12 weeks. The typical treatment duration is up to 3 months, followed by intermittent maintenance therapy. Despite initial therapy with CP 0.05%, recurrences were reported in 67% of girls within 1 year, with 37% requiring additional treatment after 3 months.

Tacrolimus 0.03%‐0.1% ointment also shows improvements in LS symptoms, though it may be less effective than CP 0.05%. It is often used alongside CP 0.05% or as a bridge during remission. Research by Anderson indicates that tacrolimus 0.1% can be a promising option for maintenance therapy, though it may initially cause a brief burning sensation upon application.

After treatment with potent topical corticosteroids (TCS), Ellis and Fischer prescribed individualized maintenance regimes using moderate- or mild-potency TCS, successfully preventing scarring and disease progression in adherent patients. Surgery is typically not recommended for girls with LS, though introitus-plasty may occasionally be warranted in adolescence when LS is inactive.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113YD3Ss]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up in 83 women, with a median follow-up time of 4.7 years, confirmed a high relapse rate of 84% at 4 years. Despite this, even with long-term, ultrapotent, topical corticosteroid maintenance treatment, tolerance in this cohort was excellent; surprisingly, no atrophic effects were observed.

Several studies have shown that less potent topical corticosteroids, such as mometasone furoate or triamcinolone, are also effective in treating vulvar LS. Cattaneo et al. treated 31 women with biopsy-proven vulvar LS using a regimen of 0.1% mometasone furoate cream applied once daily for 4 weeks, then twice weekly for 8 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, all women had significant improvements in the gross aspects of the disease and a dramatic decrease in symptoms, with nearly all subjects achieving complete symptomatic remission. No adverse effects were observed. The use of a less potent topical corticosteroid could be safer, particularly for the long-term maintenance treatment of LS. To minimize corticosteroid exposure, it is the successful practice of many clinics to lower the potency and frequency of applied corticosteroids once remission has been achieved and maintenance therapy is required.

In the treatment of childhood vulvar LS, an excellent response to a potent topical corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%) without serious adverse events was first described in a small case series in 1997. Other authors have confirmed these results in prepubertal girls treated with ultrapotent topical corticosteroids, likewise without significant adverse effects.

### Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1121oBLP]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review is to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of genital lichen sclerosus (LS), its urologic manifestations, and available treatment options.

Materials and Methods: The Medline/PubMed and Embase databases were systematically reviewed for publications related to LS. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, references were assessed for relevance to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of LS through title and abstract review by two independent reviewers, yielding 186 articles for assessment.

Results: The contemporary understanding of the epidemiology and histology of LS is reviewed herein. Additionally, three hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanism contributing to disease presentation are explored in detail: infectious etiology, primary immune dysregulation, and the isotraumatopic response. We summarize the available biological evidence supporting each hypothesis. This discussion provides context for understanding LS morbidity and may spur new avenues of research. For clinicians, we review the clinical presentation of the disease, including the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. Medical and surgical treatment options are also detailed.

Conclusion: LS remains a potentially insidious disease that may lead to debilitating urinary and sexual dysfunction. Cross-disciplinary research should aim for earlier detection, as well as more effective and durable treatment options. The exact cause of LS remains unknown.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus: An update for dermatologists [^113MdKLw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is an important skin disease that is common in women in their 50s and beyond; however, it can also affect females of any age, including children. If not treated, it has the potential to cause significant and permanent scarring and deformity of the vulvar structure. In addition, if untreated, it is associated with a 2–6% lifetime risk of malignant squamous neoplasia of the vulva. Lichen sclerosus has been considered a difficult-to-manage condition; however, both serious complications can potentially be prevented with early intervention with topical corticosteroid, suggesting that the course of the disease can be treatment-modified.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Pathophysiology and treatment [^116ZTUXo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic disorder of the skin and mucosal surfaces, most commonly seen on the female genital skin, though it can occur on other areas of the body. It affects individuals of any age group, but is more frequently observed in elderly women. The exact cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown. There have been reports of family members with this condition, suggesting a potential genetic link. Additionally, an autoimmune connection is possible.

Currently, ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are the preferred medical treatment. Other treatments used for this condition include testosterone, progesterone, tacrolimus, surgery, and phototherapy. Surgery should be limited to symptomatic patients who do not respond to multiple medical treatments due to a high recurrence rate following surgery.

The risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is approximately 5% in women with vulvar lichen sclerosus. This necessitates close surveillance by both the healthcare provider and the patient. This review discusses the history, clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus, along with issues related to pregnancy and sexual function in affected patients. Additionally, specific problems encountered by children with lichen sclerosus are reviewed.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115njFh1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Studies concerning pediatric lichen sclerosus are limited, and, at the time of writing, there have been no studies comparing the course of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls. We sought to examine all publications on boys and girls with lichen sclerosus and assess and compare epidemiology, symptoms and signs, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in the Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were information on children ages 0–18 years and a clinical or histologic diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. Literature from 1985 to 2021 was reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 1780 articles were retrieved from the search, of which 90 articles were eligible for inclusion. Boys and girls present similarly on many aspects; nonetheless, treatment and follow-up are approached differently.

- **Conclusions**: Though the clinical approach is often different, lichen sclerosus in boys and girls demonstrates many similarities. More research is needed, especially on follow-up, to gain a better understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Conservative management of penile and urethral lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1161Sexa]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Low credibility.

We evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of currently available conservative management options for penile and urethral lichen sclerosus.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of existing literature on lichen sclerosus was conducted utilizing the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. References were assessed for relevance to nonsurgical management of male genital lichen sclerosus by title and abstract by three independent reviewers, then reviewed in full and in duplicate by five independent reviewers.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies describing conservative management of histologically confirmed penile and urethral lichen sclerosus in male patients were included in the final review. We present available evidence supporting the use of four major treatment modalities represented in the existing literature: topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, platelet-rich plasma, and CO2 laser. We also briefly discuss the limited studies on the use of oral acitretin and polydeoxyribonucleotide injections. Outcomes assessed include symptoms, clinical appearance, quality of life, sexual satisfaction, adverse effects, and long-term efficacy of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay of conservative management of penile and urethral lichen sclerosus. Literature supports the use of other therapies such as tacrolimus and platelet-rich plasma as alternatives or adjuvant treatments when escalation of treatment is necessary. Future research should further explore the efficacy and safety of newer therapies through additional controlled clinical trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^114T64e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Systemic retinoids have been used in the past with considerable success in severe vulvar LS, but in women of childbearing age, the teratogenic risk limits their use. Surgery should be limited to patients with associated malignancy or to patients who need correction of functionally restricting, scarring processes. Phototherapy and PDT are possible third-line therapies in cases resistant to the aforementioned treatments. Genital LS is associated with scarring and an increased risk for vulvar and penile SCC. Long-term follow-up and ongoing suppressive treatment are mandatory.

### A survey of experts regarding the treatment of adult vulvar lichen sclerosus [^111hnG17]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this work was to survey physician members and fellows of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease to determine expert opinion regarding the management of adult vulvar lichen sclerosus.

A cross-sectional design was used. An electronic survey was emailed to all members and fellows of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease. Responses were analyzed using univariate methods. Subgroup analyses were performed to report treatment differences between gynecologists and dermatologists and between physicians in the United States and Europe.

In total, 128 (42%) of 305 providers responded to the survey. Analysis was confined to the 114 physician respondents who treat patients with lichen sclerosus. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% is the most common first-line agent used in lichen sclerosus (85%). The most common second-line agents used are tacrolimus (39%), other topical steroids (28%), and intralesional steroids (13%). Most physicians (59%) start all patients with lichen sclerosus on drug therapy at an initial visit, regardless of symptoms. Dermatologists are more likely to treat all patients (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) than gynecologists (p < .01). Most physicians (64%) continue maintenance therapy in all patients. Gynecologists are more likely than dermatologists to treat only when patients are symptomatic versus using maintenance therapy (p = .03). Physicians practicing in the United States are more likely than those practicing in Europe to treat all patients with lichen sclerosus.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^1176NjrT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

A complete clearance of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is achieved in a minority of patients treated with a standard 12-week duration corticosteroid treatment. The aim of this pragmatic, retrospective, open label, comparative trial was to assess the effectiveness, in terms of complete clearance, of a 24-week treatment with mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment (MMF) and to compare it with a 12-week therapy.

We included VLS patients treated with MMF administered for five consecutive days per week for 24 weeks (group A). The following were assessed:

- **Clearance in Global Subjective Score (GSS), Global Objective Score (GOS) or both**
- **Changes of these parameters and dyspareunia at treatment completion compared to baseline**
- **Safety profile**:

All these assessments were compared with the same outcomes recorded among VLS patients who had previously undergone a 12-week MMF treatment (group B). Twenty-nine patients were included in group A, and 32 in group B. The rates of patients who achieved the clearance of GSS, GOS, or both parameters did not significantly differ between groups A and B. The groups did not differ in any of the effectiveness outcomes assessed. A 24-week duration corticosteroid treatment does not seem to provide significant therapeutic benefits in comparison with standard 12-week courses, especially considering the occurrence of complete clearance.

### Lichen sclerosus: Review of the literature and current recommendations for management [^115igr6h]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We reviewed the literature regarding the clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, and medical and surgical management of lichen sclerosus in men.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of the literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, and other electronic databases between 1950 and 2006 using the keywords "lichen sclerosus", "balanitis xerotica obliterans", and "urethral stricture". Our search resulted in 1,268 sources containing the words "lichen sclerosus" or "balanitis xerotica obliterans". We reviewed 68 articles in peer-reviewed journals and 2 chapters on this subject.

- **Results**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, lymphocyte-mediated skin disease first described in 1887. It shows a predilection for the anogenital area in both men and women. Much has been discovered regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and histological features of this disease process over the last century, including the discovery of a strong association between lichen sclerosus and squamous cell carcinoma. The techniques of medical and surgical management of this disorder are still being elucidated. Biopsy of the initial lesion for definitive diagnosis and long-term follow-up of affected patients are well-established, critical elements in the management of lichen sclerosus.

- **Conclusions**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, debilitating condition that may progress to cause significant voiding complications. Biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of having lichen sclerosus to rule out squamous cell carcinoma. Further research is needed to improve the prevention and understanding of this condition.

### Systemic therapy for lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^115cW3CK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory process affecting predominantly anogenital skin, with extragenital involvement in up to 20% of cases. The mainstay of therapy for anogenital LS is topical immunosuppression. However, in treatment-refractory cases, severe, or hypertrophic disease, systemic modalities may be used. Currently, there are no guidelines for systemic therapy in LS.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to provide a review of the literature on the use of systemic therapies for LS, including demographic and clinical features of LS, as well as reported outcomes.

- **Methods**: A primary literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science, from the year the journal was published until June 2022.

- **Results**: Ultimately, 71 studies consisting of 392 patients were included. Of these, 65% (n = 254) had anogenital disease, 9% (n = 36) had extragenital disease, 19% (n = 73) had both anogenital and extragenital disease, and in 7% (n = 29) of cases, the location was not specified. The most frequent therapies, stratified by total cases, included oral retinoids (n = 227), methotrexate (n = 59), hydroxychloroquine (n = 36), and systemic steroids such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, oral triamcinolone, and other systemic steroids (n = 60). Overall, 76% (n = 194) of anogenital, 94% (n = 34) of extragenital, and 81% (n = 59) of patients with both anogenital and extragenital involvement were reported to have clinical or symptomatic improvement.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, many therapies have been used for lichen sclerosus, reflecting a variety of approaches to this condition.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^116AyTAc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The ideal treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) should aim at inducing relief of symptoms, reversing signs, and preventing further anatomical changes. Adherence to long-term treatment was also shown to prevent progression towards cancer. On the basis of the immunological pathophysiology of VLS, high-potency topical corticosteroids represent the first-line treatment in the active phase of the disease. Consistent with this, there is strong evidence that potent and ultra-potent corticosteroids have an excellent effect on both symptom control and, although to a lesser extent, on reversal of clinical signs. This evidence is largely based on trials of 12-week duration, which is the conventional duration of trials assessing the effectiveness of topical treatments in the active phase of the disease.

Despite significant improvement in symptoms and signs, a recent retrospective study highlighted the fact that complete cure of VLS occurs in a minority of patients treated with 12-week therapies. This means that, at treatment completion, most patients may still have substantial residual disease, with possible negative effects on their well-being and quality of life. In this regard, one might wonder if treatment courses that are longer than the conventional duration may provide therapeutic advantages and increase the chance of complete clearance.

The present study purposely assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of a 24-week treatment with a potent corticosteroid. A comparison was also made with the treatment outcomes achieved with a standard 12-week duration.
