## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the radius of the largest sphere that fits in the central void of a cube, touching eight identical spheres arranged at the corners, each of diameter 20, with the cube's side length 40. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the coordinate system and the centers of the eight corner spheres. Then, I should verify the distance from the cube's center to any corner sphere's center. Next, I will consider the geometry of the central sphere touching those eight spheres and derive its radius. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and select the closest option from the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the setup and coordinates. The cube has side length 40, so I will place its origin at the center, making the cube extend from −20 to +20 along each axis. Each corner sphere has diameter 20, so its radius is 10, and because each sphere touches three faces, its center is 10 units away from each of those faces. Thus, the centers of the eight corner spheres are at (± 10, ± 10, ± 10), which I should verify aligns with the constraint that the cube's half-width is 20 and the sphere radius is 10, so the spheres indeed fit snugly at the corners [^notfound].

> Now, I need to find the distance from the cube's center (0, 0, 0) to any corner sphere's center. Using the 3D distance formula, that distance is √(10² + 10² + 10²) = √300 = 10√3. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: 10² is 100, three of those is 300, and √300 simplifies to 10√3, which is approximately 17.32, so that checks out [^notfound].

> Next, I should consider the central sphere. The largest sphere that fits in the void and touches all eight corner spheres will have its center at the cube's center (0, 0, 0), and its surface will just meet the surfaces of the eight corner spheres. Therefore, the distance from the central sphere's center to any corner sphere's center equals the sum of their radii. If R is the radius of the central sphere, then 10√3 = 10 + R, so R = 10√3 − 10 = 10(√3 − 1). Hold on, I should verify that logic: yes, the center-to-center distance equals the sum of radii when two spheres touch externally, so this subtraction is correct [^notfound].

> I will now examine the numerical value. √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3 − 1 ≈ 0.732, and 10 × 0.732 ≈ 7.32. Therefore, R ≈ 7.32, which is closest to option B, 7.3. Wait, let me double-check the multiplication: 10 × 0.732 is indeed 7.32, so rounding to one decimal place gives 7.3, confirming the choice [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I misapplied the geometry? Could the central sphere be larger if it doesn't sit exactly at the cube's center? Let me reconsider: symmetry dictates that the maximal inscribed sphere touching all eight identical corner spheres must be centered at the cube's center, and the distance argument remains valid, so the radius calculation stands. Thus, the closest answer is B, 7.3 [^notfound].

---

The largest sphere that fits in the central void, touching all eight corner spheres, has a radius of **10(√3 − 1) ≈ 7.32**. This is closest to option **B. 7.3**.

---

## Geometric setup

- **Cube dimensions**: side length 40, centered at the origin, with corners at (± 20, ± 20, ± 20).
- **Corner spheres**: diameter 20, radius 10, centered at (± 10, ± 10, ± 10).
- **Central sphere**: radius r, centered at (0, 0, 0), touching all eight corner spheres.

---

## Distance calculation

The distance from the cube center to any corner sphere center is:

√(10² + 10² + 10²) = 10√3

For the central sphere to touch a corner sphere, the distance between centers equals the sum of radii:

10√3 = 10 + r

Solving for r:

r = 10√3 − 10 = 10(√3 − 1) ≈ 7.32

---

## Conclusion

The largest sphere that fits in the central void has a radius of **approximately 7.32**, which is closest to option **B. 7.3**.

Model generation

Clusters were generated by choosing the positions of identical spheres according to geometric construction rules. All models correspond to one or multiple domains with perfect, sheared, or otherwise deformed FCC crystal structure. Deformations were chosen to maximize symmetry and packing fraction. MCCs were constructed in five steps by placing 130 tetrahedral grains, each with (m + 1)(m + 2)(m + 3)/6 spheres (Mackay core with m shells). Multiple tetrahedra share spheres at vertices, edges, and faces. The first step follows Mackayby placing 20 tetrahedral grains around a common vertex with the constraint that spheres in each shell touch spheres in the previous shell. In step two, 20 identical tetrahedra were placed over the faces such that the top shells of the Mackay icosahedron acted as mirror planes. In the third step, the gaps were filled by connecting existing vertices. These tetrahedra were slightly more deformed than the previous ones. In the fourth step, vertex regions were filled with pentagonal bipyramids made from five tetrahedral grains such that symmetry was preserved. These tetrahedra had the largest deformation. In the fifth step, all spheres outside of a central sphere with truncation radius R cut were removed. Clusters with FCC structure for the free energy calculations in Fig. 5h were generated by applying only the truncation step to a single FCC grain. The model generation was implemented in a Python code.

Cluster type classification

MCC type for clusters assembled in experiment or simulation was identified by evaluating the characteristic rectangular features (width a + 1, height l + 1) and truncated triangle features (edge lengths (m − l − a)/2 + 1 and l + 1) with an integer l that describes the amount of vertex truncation. Vertex truncation varies from cluster to cluster (Supplementary Figure 17) broadening the minima in Fig. 5h.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

### Phase separation of a microtubule plus-end tracking protein into a fluid fractal network [^ae9d81ce]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Data fitting with Gaussian blobs: To estimate the mass distribution on the length scale of many Bik1 dimers, we fit the SAXS data using 4000 Gaussian blobs with a standard deviation σ of 40 Å. The blobs are arranged in a spherical volume with a diameter of 10,000 Å, which is large enough to cover the largest length scale that can be resolved by our SAXS measurements. The use of Gaussian blobs for our data fitting approach is convenient as the real space and the reciprocal space representations are described by Gaussians. This approach provides a possible configuration that is orientationally averaged for the fit to the SAXS data, as many droplets contributed to a measurement. Therefore, the scattering curve for the fit is calculated as the average resulting from 300 random orientations of the momentum transfer vector. Least-square fits to the SAXS data were performed using a self-developed code written in the Julia language.

The form factor of the sphere containing the Gaussian blobs must be suppressed, as it would disturb the fit at low q. This is achieved by using a Gaussian window placed at the center of mass of the set of blobs used to fit the measurement and decaying from the origin to the outward. The scattering amplitudes of all blobs in the volume are multiplied with this window function, which corresponds to a convolution with a Gaussian in reciprocal space. The window function is used with a standard deviation σ w = 3000 Å, which sets the q resolution of the fit to 2π/ σ w ≈ 0.002 Å − 1.

Data fitting with spherocylinders: Our SEC-SAXS results revealed an elongated, cylindrical conformation for the Bik1 dimer, which is considerably different than Gaussian blobs. They further suggested that the overall conformation of the protein is dominated by its two-stranded coiled coil with little if any, contributions from its N- and C-terminal domains. Based on our computational analysis, this coiled coil can be divided into three segments that are connected by flexible linkers. To fit our SAXS data with a more realistic representation of the Bik1 dimer, we thus constructed three models with increasing complexity: model 1 consists of a single spherocylinder with a radius of 12 Å and a length of ≈300 Å; model 2 consists of two linked spherocylinders with radii of 12 Å and lengths of 155 Å and 135 Å, respectively; model 3 consists of three linked spherocylinders with radii of 12 Å and lengths of 155 Å, 76 Å, and 50 Å, respectively.

### A 3D ray traced biological neural network learning model [^d041c40c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The plus markers in Fig. 2 e show the probability of forming a neural connection compared to the neural connection length normalized to r n using RT-3 as a raytracing method. In this figure, the RT-3 radius is 40 r n and has a diameter of 80 r n. Consider a single neuron that is the starting point for a ray. When the ray moves further away from the starting neuron, the number of cells for the ray to terminate increases exponentially. This is reflected in Fig. 2 e, where the probability of forming a neural connection increases quadratically as the neural connection length increases linearly. The quadratic relationship holds until the neural connection length reaches close to the network radius, where the probability of forming a neural connection peaks. Afterward, the probability decays because the neurons outside of the 40 r n radius sphere are prohibited to connect. Moreover, the probability of forming a neural connection is zero when the neural connection length is greater than the diameter of the neural network sphere. At sufficiently low density, the neuron length distribution is nearly unchanged by the density. The probability distribution is further confirmed from theoretic analysis under low-density approximation detailed in the "Neural connection length probability distribution function" section and displayed as solid lines with the same color. As shown, at a low density of(red color), the simulation data (plus markers) displays large fluctuation due to low cell counts inside the cluster sphere, and at the largest density of(purple line), the theoretical model does not match the probability well as the low-density approximation is no longer satisfied. Meanwhile, at the densities in between, the theoretic model is in close agreement with the simulation.

Figure 2 f shows that the number of neural connections also changes with the density. When the density is low at(blue solid line), the number of neural connections per neuron is 400. As the density increases to(red solid line),(yellow solid line), and(purple solid line), the number of connections per neuron drops to 300, 200, 150, and finally at(dark red line) to around 15 connections per neuron. This is due to glial cells and the other neurons blocking the number of connections when the neural network is very dense.

Step 2: Embed steric information

Based on standardized 3D structure, herein we took the chlorine atom of aryl halides as an example to illustrate the generation of steric information. With the chlorine atom at the center, a sphere of radius 10 Å was built. The radius of this sphere can be customized depending on the sizes of the molecules in the dataset. In our study, there were a number of fairly large molecules with more than 180 atoms. 10 Å was assigned as the radius of the sphere to ensure the full description of the steric environment. The distance between the van der Waals surface and the spherical surface was calculated and mapped to the sphere. The steric mapping of the distance on the sphere was encoded as a two-dimensional matrix using equirectangular projection. Based on the selected number N (default is 10) of grids, the polar angle θ (0– π) dimension was evenly segmented to N parts (θ i = π / N), and the azimuth angle φ (0–2 π) dimension was evenly segmented to 2 N parts (φ j = π / N). This provided N × 2 N distance matrix; in our study, a 10 × 20 matrix was generated for each atom. This 10 × 20 matrix was embedded into the node of the molecular graph to describe the steric information of the atom. Repeating the process for each atom in the molecule, the steric information was embedded in the nodes of the molecular graph.

Step 3: Embed electronic information

Starting with the standardized 3D structure, the density matrix was generated by PySCFat the B3LYP/def2-SVP level. Taking the chlorine atom as an example, a 7 × 7 × 7 cubic grid with the chlorine atom at the center was generated. The side length of the cube was the van der Waals diameter of chlorine. According to the Cartesian coordinates of the chlorine atoms and the 7 × 7 × 7 cubic grid, the Cartesian coordinates of the 7 × 7 × 7 cubic grids' center position were obtained. By evaluating the electron density of the 7 × 7 × 7 cubic grids' center position, a 7 × 7 × 7 tensor was generated and further used as the electronic information for embedding into the node of the molecular graph. Repeating the process for each atom in the molecule, the electronic information was embedded in the nodes of the molecular graph.

(J) Distribution of the number of GC dendrites per MF rosette. (C)–(F) are at the same magnification, with scale bar on (F) applying to all panels. Scales, 1 mm in (A), 20 μm in (B)–(F), and 2 μm in G.

We examined the likely spatial extent of a local GC layer network by building a 3D anatomical model of MF-GC connectivity (Figure 1 H), using our measured parameters together with existing measurements of MF rosette spacing (20 μm parasagittal and 60 μm mediolateral;). The claw-like ending of each GC dendrite contacts a single MF rosette. GC dendrites rarely exceed 30 μm (e.g. 4% in the cat;,), making the likelihood of a GC being innervated by two or more rosettes from the same MF low. The number of GC dendrites is therefore equal to the number of MF synaptic connections per GC (d). Moreover, the MFs that converge onto a GC typically arise from multiple precerebellar nuclei. To recreate these conditions, model GCs were placed at random in a sphere at the measured anatomical density within a central subfield of MFs to minimize edge effects (Figure 1 H). Each model GC made synaptic connections to randomly selected MF rosettes, with the constraint that the dendritic length should be close to 15 μm. In practice, they rarely exceeded 20 μm (Figure 1 I), as observed experimentally. Since the maximum distance between two GCs that could share the same MF input was ∼40 μm, the largest ball of tissue that could be expected to have independent inputs was 80 μm in diameter, which is comparable to the thickness of the GC layer in rodents. Our anatomically constrained model of this "local GCL network" contained 176 MF synaptic rosettes and 509 GCs (Figure 1 H). For an average of four dendrites per GC, a single MF rosette made synaptic connections with an average of 12 different GCs (Figure 1 J), consistent with estimates of 15–20 in monkey and cat.

### Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures responsible for mechanical properties in covalent amorphous solids [^e9ebd21b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Filled polygons represent cycles transforming into boundaries. Sequence of empty and filled polygons depicts the concept of children: the red triangle is a child of the blue pentagon, and the yellow triangle is a child of the green hexagon. h Persistence diagram obtained from the filtration process. Squared radii (Å 2) are used as birth and death radii. Colors correspond to the polygons in the filtration process.

In addition to the inhomogeneous atomic displacement, another key aspect is the interplay between softness and the medium-range order (MRO), which is a distinctive feature of amorphous structures. Generally, MRO refers to atomic organization on a scale of 5–20 Å, which does not appear in purely random configurations. In covalent amorphous materials, network structures consist of polyhedral units created by atomic bonds that share corners, edges, and faces. Figure 1b shows an example of a corner-sharing network. The organization of the bond-length scale within polyhedral units is called the short-range order (SRO), whereas the MRO corresponds to the relative angles and connectivity between polyhedra. The angle between two adjacent polyhedra corresponds to the dihedral angle formed by four atoms, the restriction of which corresponds to the smallest MRO scale. When the angles between multiple polyhedra are correlated, the atomic ring structures are constrained and an MRO is imposed on a longer scale. However, the relationship between the MRO in these covalent amorphous networks and softness remains unexplored.

Challenging new ideas

Equal-sized spheres are frustrated in three dimensions, so that packing is non-ideal around every atom. Thus, the distance between symmetrically-placed spheres in the first shell of an icosahedron is 5% larger than the distance to the icosahedron centre. This frustration can be overcome by packing tetrahedra of equal-sized hyperspheres on the curved surface of a four-dimensional sphere, but adding unequal spheres is a much simpler three-dimensional approach to reduce frustration. For example, the gaps in an icosahedron disappear when the central sphere has a radius that is 0.9022 that of the surrounding spheres, eliminating packing frustration around the central sphere. Structures built from such efficiently packed clusters are more efficiently packed than equal-sized spheres but remain frustrated, since packing around the first shell atoms is still inefficient. This frustration is apparent by the gaps between clusters–called β and γ sites in the ECP model. In principle, packing frustration can be further reduced by filling β and γ sites, but these sites are typically smaller than metallic atoms so that filling these sites pushes the surrounding clusters apart and actually decreases global packing efficiency. Thus, unequal spheres can reduce packing frustration relative to systems of equal-sized spheres, but most atoms remain inefficiently packed. This example uses iscosahedra — the same is true for structures of efficiently packed clusters with different total coordination numbers.

Here we further reduce packing frustration and increase global packing efficiency by establishing the specific conditions for efficient packing around all atoms simultaneously in systems of unequal spheres. Simply stated, if every atom is efficiently packed locally, then the structure may be more efficiently packed globally. This becomes apparent by realizing that atoms in the first shell of one efficiently packed cluster are the centres for other efficiently packed clusters (Fig. 4). Simultaneous efficient packing and self-consistency are achieved only on average throughout the structure, since some variability in actual partial coordination numbers, and hence in local packing efficiency, is expected due to kinetic constraints. Using atomic volumes and measured densities, global packing fractions above 0.70 and as high as 0.76 are typical for the most stable binary metallic glasses. The face-centred cubic (fcc) cluster-packing scheme of the ECP model is still an essential feature, since it gives the medium-range atomic order observed in metallic glasses.

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^d9a97c99]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is commonly believed that the most efficient way to pack a finite number of equal-sized spheres is by arranging them tightly in a cluster. However, mathematicians have conjectured that a linear arrangement may actually result in the densest packing. Here, our combined experimental and simulation study provides a physical realization of the finite sphere packing problem by studying arrangements of colloids in a flaccid lipid vesicle. We map out a state diagram displaying linear, planar, and cluster conformations of spheres, as well as bistable states which alternate between cluster-plate and plate-linear conformations due to membrane fluctuations. Finally, by systematically analyzing truncated polyhedral packings, we identify clusters of 56 ≤ N ≤ 70 number of spheres, excluding N = 57 and 63, that pack more efficiently than linear arrangements.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^02791c69]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A, The frequency obtained by averaging withinincluding the whole magnetic microstructure. B, The volume outsidehas been coarse grained. C, The magnetic microstructure has been nulled within, and the frequency is calculated at the point. The frequency is induced by an external field. The mesoscopic region is tested as a cube, sphere and cylinder.

3.1.3 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

The purpose of the next simulation was to validate Equation (21) describing the MRI‐measured Larmor frequency when the sample consists of a slowly varying magnetic microstructure, and quantify the error we obtain when (b1) we filter the measured Larmor frequency (as described in Equation 8), (b2) neglect the sampling PSF (as explained in Appendix A.2) and finally (b3) partition the magnetic microstructure in order to compute the macroscopic contribution (cf. Equation 57 in Appendix A.2) to the measured Larmor frequency.

Figure 5 illustrates the sample used to test the error from these three points. We constructed a sample consisting of 27 cubes, denoted, stacked(blue square in Figure 5A). Each cube had side length(see Figure 5) and contained a configuration of cylinders with a randomly chosen axially symmetric orientation dispersion and volume fraction(i.e. different for each cube). Susceptibility variations were introduced by randomly choosing a normalized microscopic susceptibilityfor each cube (in reality, but as we only consider field ratios the absolute magnitude is irrelevant). The sample was further partitioned into smaller cubeswith center points denotedand with side length, i.e. one‐third of the larger cubes(indicated by the orange square in Figure 5A). This construction ensured a sample with a more slowly varying microstructure across, as seen at, since the abrupt edges between the cubesare far away. Thus, every large cubewith a distinct magnetic microstructure contained 27 smaller cubes, and so the entire sample was partitioned into 729 cubesstacked.

### Universal hidden order in amorphous cellular geometries [^a54cfed4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Partitioning space into cells with certain extreme geometrical properties is a central problem in many fields of science and technology. Here we investigate the Quantizer problem, defined as the optimisation of the moment of inertia of Voronoi cells, i.e., similarly-sized 'sphere-like' polyhedra that tile space are preferred. We employ Lloyd's centroidal Voronoi diagram algorithm to solve this problem and find that it converges to disordered states associated with deep local minima. These states are universal in the sense that their structure factors are characterised by a complete independence of a wide class of initial conditions they evolved from. They moreover exhibit an anomalous suppression of long-wavelength density fluctuations and quickly become effectively hyperuniform. Our findings warrant the search for novel amorphous hyperuniform phases and cellular materials with unique physical properties.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

Adhesion experiments

In the adhesion experiments, we directly image the deformation of the silicone gel during contact and subsequent quasi-static separation using an inverted optical microscope. We illuminate the sample with a low-Numerical Aperture (N. A.) condenser and image using a ×40 (N. A. = 0.60) air objective. To prepare the gel substrates in an appropriate geometry for visualization, we deposit a ~300-μm-thick layer of PDMS along the millimeter-wide edge of a standard microscope slide, as in the zero-force brightfield experiments of ref. The silicone surface is flat parallel to the long edge of the microscope slide and very slightly curved (radius of curvature ~700 μm) in the orthogonal direction. This creates a very-nearly flat solid silicone surface that presents a flat edge clearly visible from the side. For the rigid, spherical indenters, we use untreated silica spheres (Polysciences, 07668) attached to the tapered ends of initially 1-mm-wide glass rods pulled to roughly 10 μm in diameter. We use two-part 5-min epoxy (Elmer's) to attach the spheres to the rods, waiting 6–10 min after mixing before applying the glue to the spheres. This ensures that the glue does not flow over the sphere and change its surface properties. By mounting the glass rods on a three-axis micromanipulator stage (Narshige MMO-023), we are able to control manually the position of the individual spheres with sub-micrometer precision. Although high-speed imaging indicates that the initial contact deformation is complete in about a second, we allow the initial contact to equilibrate for ~10 min after first touch. We then quasi-statically move the spheres away from the surfaces (D < 0) by slowly moving the micromanipulator by 2 μm every 20 s, taking an image of the sphere adhered to the deformed substrate just before each step. We confirmed that these are stable configurations by extending the time between steps to 60 s, as well as by leaving a sphere and substrate in an adhered but highly deformed configuration for up to an hour, and observed no difference in the substrate deformation profile. We continue to increase the separation between sphere and silicone gel substrate until the adhesion becomes unstable. Given the small size of the particles, we would expect gravity to be negligible, but as the images are taken from the side, gravity is always normal to the plane of the images and hence has no role in the substrate deformation. We process each brightfield image from the adhesion experiments to locate the surface with precision of about 100 nm over a 427-μm field of view using the method and software developed in ref.and described in detail therein. We measure the contact point between the adhered spheres and the PDMS surface, as well as the curvature of the surface near contact by fitting the measured profiles, with a shape that is the intersection of two surfaces of constant total curvature that meet at the contact line. We use the same algorithm and software developed for and described in detail in ref. with the exception that we fix the contact angle to zero based on previous measurements. From these fits, we measure the domain of constant curvature as the path length over which the constant curvature fit describes the data well, defined as the region over which the fit residuals remain small.

### A size-adaptive RF coil for MRI of the pediatric human brain at 7 T [^b0a8f2e4]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Noise correlation matrices, collected with the coil loaded using the pediatric head phantom at the coil's smallest and largest size, are given in Figure 8. At the smallest size of the Rx former, the mean noise correlation was 14.1% and the maximum noise correlation was 58.9% (channels 21 and 27). At the largest size of the Rx former, the mean and maximum noise correlation values were 11.9% and 53.2% (channels 11 and 20), respectively. At the smallest and largest size of the array, seven and five channel combinations were above 40%, respectively.

FIGURE 8
Noise correlation matrices for the receive (Rx) coil array with the former at its (A) smallest and (B) largest size using the pediatric head phantom as a load.

Sagittal SNR maps acquired in the pediatric head phantom are shown for the smallest (Figure 9A) and largest size configurations of the Rx array (Figure 9B). Central SNR was determined by taking the mean value (± SD) of a 40‐mm diameter spherical ROI at the center of the phantom. The mean central SNR values for the small and large size coil configurations were 88 ± 9 and 78 ± 7, respectively. Peripheral SNR was determined using a 15‐mm thick spherical surface ROI with an outer radius of 65 mm. The mean peripheral SNR for the small and large size configurations was 77 ± 28 and 68 ± 29, respectively. The SD of the peripheral SNR was higher than the central SNR because of the larger ROI. Overall, adjusting the size of the coil to better fit the dimensions of the pediatric head phantom yielded a 13% increase in central SNR and a 14% increase in peripheral SNR.

Formation and imaging of binary colloidal crystals

To form DD crystals, we use an aqueous suspension containing two types of similarly sized microspheres with diameters of roughly 400 nm, which have been engineered to have controllable and chemically specific interactions. For the two species 'A' and 'B', our four adjustable parameters are two 'like' attraction strengths, U AA and U BB, one 'unlike' one, U AB = U BA, (defined as positive-valued parameters) and the spheres' diameter ratio, σ A / σ B. The interactions are realized and modulated by grafting various amounts of complementary DNA strands to the two particle species' surfaces, see Methods for details. When two microspheres bearing complementary DNA sequences come near contact, DNA hybridization leads to molecular bridges that pull the spheres together. At sufficiently high DNA densitythe attraction resembles an isotropic, reversible interaction potentialwith a range of about 30 nm. All particle pairs also exhibit a soft repulsion near contact due to the compression of their DNA brushes, having a range of roughly 10 nm. Since both length scales are much shorter than a particle radius, we consider the particles to act nearly as 'sticky' hard spheres, whose packing is determined by the size of their hard cores, but with an additional energy benefit when spheres with complementary DNA are in contact. Temperature provides a convenient means to modulate the colloidal interactions, since DNA bridges dissociate at elevated temperature. To form crystals, we place a binary suspension of 20% total particle volume fraction in a slowly cooling hot water bath. As the temperature falls, the attractive interactions become gradually stronger until crystals form by homogeneous nucleation.

The resulting, typically polyhedralcrystallites are permanently crosslinked by enzymatic ligation, mounted in a high-index mounting medium and imaged on a confocal microscope. The two particle types are stained with different dyes: smaller A spheres in green, and larger B spheres in red, which can be imaged separately. With the particle sizes and mounting medium we use, the crystallites are effectively transparent, and we can observe both their global shape and lattice structure throughout their depth. While confocal microscopy cannot resolve the three-dimensional structure of sub-micron lattices in the depth direction, it can resolve the particle arrangement and spacing in two-dimensional focal plane slices. The resulting images resemble the superposition of two adjacent crystal planes parallel to the focal plane. By matching these patterns to computer-rendered lattice models from different viewing angles, for an ensemble of crystallites and two colour channels, the three-dimensional lattice structures can be reliably inferred.

### A phase diagram for jammed matter [^5695d25e]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The problem of finding the most efficient way to pack spheres has a long history, dating back to the crystalline arrays conjectured by Kepler and the random geometries explored by Bernal. Apart from its mathematical interest, the problem has practical relevance in a wide range of fields, from granular processing to fruit packing. There are currently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres (random loose packing) gives a density of approximately 55 per cent. On the other hand, the most compact way to pack spheres (random close packing) results in a maximum density of approximately 64 per cent. Although these values seem to be robust, there is as yet no physical interpretation for them. Here we present a statistical description of jammed states in which random close packing can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of jammed matter. Our approach demonstrates that random packings of hard spheres in three dimensions cannot exceed a density limit of approximately 63.4 per cent. We construct a phase diagram that provides a unified view of the hard-sphere packing problem and illuminates various data, including the random-loose-packed state.

### Shape-dependent ordering of gold nanocrystals into large-scale superlattices [^e12f17e2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of individual building blocks into highly ordered structures, analogous to spontaneous growth of crystals from atoms, is a promising approach to realize the collective properties of nanocrystals. Yet the ability to reliably produce macroscopic assemblies is unavailable and key factors determining assembly quality/yield are not understood. Here we report the formation of highly ordered superlattice films, with single crystalline domains of up to half a millimetre in two dimensions and thickness of up to several microns from nanocrystals with tens of nanometres in diameter. Combining experimental and computational results for gold nanocrystals in the shapes of spheres, cubes, octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra, we investigate the entire self-assembly process from disordered suspensions to large-scale ordered superlattices induced by nanocrystal sedimentation and eventual solvent evaporation. Our findings reveal that the ultimate coherence length of superlattices strongly depends on nanocrystal shape. Factors inhibiting the formation of high-quality large-scale superlattices are explored in detail.

### An analytic expression for the ultimate intrinsic SNR in a uniform sphere [^7f107f6a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (UISNR) is normally calculated using electrodynamic simulations with a complete basis of modes. Here, we provide an exact solution for the UISNR at the center of a dielectric sphere and assess how accurately this solution approximates UISNR away from the center.

Methods

We performed a mode analysis to determine which modes contribute to central UISNR - ζ(r→0). We then derived an analytic expression to calculate ζ(r→0) and analyzed its dependence on main magnetic field strength, sample geometry, and electrical properties. We validated the proposed solution against an established method based on dyadic Green's function simulations.

Results

Only one divergence-free mode contributes to ζ(r→0). The UISNR given by the exact solution matched the full simulation results for various parameter settings, whereas calculation speed was approximately 1000 times faster. We showed that the analytic expression can approximate the UISNR with < 5% error at positions as much as 10–20% of the radius away from the center.

Conclusion

The proposed formula enables rapid and direct calculation of UISNR in the central region of a sphere. The resulting UISNR value may be used, for example, as an absolute reference to assess the performance of head coils with spherical phantoms.

### Measuring the size of individual particles from three-dimensional imaging experiments [^f215a900]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Often experimentalists study particulate samples that are nominally monodisperse. In reality, many samples have a polydispersity of 4–10%. At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual particle size from images of a dense sample. Here we propose a method to estimate individual particle radii from three-dimensional data of the particle positions. We first validate our method with simulations. We then apply our method to experimental data of colloidal suspensions observed with confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size distribution in situ. Finally, we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes. We show that nucleation occurs in regions that are more monodisperse than average.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### A complex sum method of quantifying susceptibilities in cylindrical objects: the first step toward quantitative diagnosis of small objects in MRI [^2cccec77]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

A complex sum method of quantifying the magnetic susceptibility of a long, narrow cylinder embedded in a uniform medium has been developed. The radius of the cylinder can be as small as one pixel. The susceptibility inside the object is extracted from the magnetic resonance complex images, using two concentric circles around the axis of the cylinder. The numerical simulations of this complex sum method are in good agreement with the phantom studies. Specifically, the method was tested with a susceptibility difference of -9 ppm to mimic air/tissue interface in the human body at 1.5 T with an echo time of 5 ms. Phantom studies using an air-filled cylinder in a solidified gel have shown that the susceptibility of the gel cannot be determined by the usual least-squares-fit method but can be determined by the complex sum method to within 5–10% of the expected value.

### Transverse slot antennas for high field MRI [^f4702fe0]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Numerical Comparison of Dipole and Slot Arrays

The Comsol Multiphysics 5.2 FEM solver was used to model the following coil array arrangements: a four‐channel dipole array, an eight‐channel dipole array, a four‐channel curved slot array, a four‐channel curved slot array where the longitudinal‐oriented edges of the conductive plates are folded away from the phantom and the same four‐channel folded antenna with a length (along z) identical to that of the dipole simulations. The evaluation was conducted to compare the potential performance of slot antenna arrays relative to dipole antenna arrays that are often arranged to encircle the body in high‐field imaging. The arrays were arranged around a cylinder with radius of 20 cm and length of 80 cm. The choice of a 40 cm diameter was chosen as if to accommodate large patients 20 with the coils placed 2 cm away from the phantom surface. The radius of the array was chosen such that imaging of large subject would be possible. Dipole tuning was performed by altering the length of the dipole resulting in a dipole length of 45 cm. For each slot antenna, a plate with arc length of 32 cm and longitudinal dimension of 30 cm contained an aperture of 30 cm by 1 cm.

### Label: BUSPIRONE HCL tablet… [^37f74c10]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

Buspirone hydrochloride is a white crystalline, water soluble compound with a molecular weight of 422.
0. Chemically, buspirone hydrochloride is 8 — butyl]-8-azaspirodecane-7, 9- dione monohydrochloride. The empirical formula C21H31N5O2
- HCl is represented by the following structural formula: Each tablet for oral administration containing 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of buspirone hydrochloride USP. The 5 mg and 10 mg tablets are scored so they can be bisected. Thus, the 5 mg tablet can also provide a 2. 5 mg dose, and the 10 mg tablet can provide a 5 mg dose. The 15 mg tablet is provided in a special tablet design. This tablet is scored so it can be either bisected or trisected. Thus, a single 15 mg tablet can provide the following doses: 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.

5 mg, or 5 mg. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Buspirone is rapidly absorbed in man and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. In a radiolabeled study, unchanged buspirone in the plasma accounted for only about 1% of the radioactivity in the plasma. Following oral administration, plasma concentrations of unchanged buspirone are very low and variable between subjects. In animal models predictive of anxiolytic potential, 1-PP has about one quarter of the activity of buspirone, but is present in up to 20-fold greater amounts. Therapeutic levels of aspirin, desipramine, diazepam, flurazepam, ibuprofen, propranolol, thioridazine, and tolbutamide had only a limited effect on the extent of binding of buspirone to plasma proteins.

### Mapping model units to visual neurons reveals population code for social behaviour [^2864549b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

We considered two types of stimulus sequences: a moving spot and a moving fictive female. The moving spot (black on isoluminant grey background) had three different stimulus sequences (Fig. 2b, c). The first stimulus sequence was a black spot with fixed diameter of 20° that moved from the left to right with a velocity chosen from candidate velocities {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80} ° s −1; each sequence lasted 2 s. The second stimulus sequence was a spot that loomed from a starting diameter of 80° to a final diameter of 180° according to the formula, where r / v is the radius-to-speed ratio with units in ms and t is the time (in ms) until the object reaches its maximum diameter(that is, t = t final − t current). A larger r / v corresponds with a slower object loom. We presented different loom speed ratios chosen from candidate r / v ∈ {10, 20, 40, 80} ms. Once a diameter of 180° was reached, the diameter remained constant. The third stimulus sequence was a spot that linearly increased its size from a starting diameter of 10° according to the formula θ = 10 + v ⋅ t, where v is the angular velocity (in ° s −1) and t is the time from stimulus onset (in seconds). The final diameter of the enlarging spot for each velocity (30°, 50°, 90° or 90°, respectively) was determined based on the chosen angular velocity v ∈ {10, 20, 40, 80} ° s −1. Once a diameter of 90° was reached, the diameter remained constant.

### Multitier mechanics control stromal adaptations in the swelling lymph node [^0ceecb15]. Nature Immunology (2022). High credibility.

For 3D analysis, large 3D volumes (xy: 306 × 306 µm, z: 50–500 µm) were acquired from Ce3D-cleared thick vibratome sections using a Apochromat LWD λS ×40/1.15 water 0.60-mm WD objective on a spinning-disk microscope (Dragonfly, Andor). Acquired 3D stacks were corrected for fluorescence intensity in the z axis using the 'bleach correction (histogram matching)' function in Fiji. Imaris was then used to generate a 3D binary image of the TRC network by utilizing a surface detection feature from the TRC network fluorescence channel. A custom MATLAB script was subsequently used to fit 3D spheres in the 3D gaps of the network analog to the 2D approach. Weighted area fractions were calculated by multiplying the area fraction for each circle (2D) or sphere (3D) with the corresponding circle or sphere diameter, respectively.

Parallel-plate compression experiments

Explanted popliteal LNs were cleaned from adipose tissue under a stereomicroscope and placed on a glass plate within the 37 °C, RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)-filled incubation chamber of a MicroSquisher device (CellScale). LNs were oriented to have their long axis along the field of view of the camera. Compression was performed with a glass plate glued onto either a 0.304-mm or a 0.408-mm diameter 40-GPa tungsten filament with a length of 60 mm. The glass slide on the compression probe was coated with Poly-HEMA (Sigma-Aldrich) to reduce sticking of the samples. LNs were then compressed to 75% of the initial height by lowering the upper plate down in a time span of 30 s. Lateral side views of LNs were recorded up to 20–60 min after onset of the experiment, while resistant forces were measured on the upper plate. Compression protocols, images and force acquisition were realized with the SquisherJoy software (CellScale). Length, height, contact area and curvature of LNs were manually measured before compression and at the equilibrium time points using Fiji. The recorded compression force together with the measured geometrical parameters was used to calculate volumes, Young's modulus, effective resistance and viscosity using a generalized Kelvin model. This was done as follows:

### A computational toolbox for the assembly yield of complex and heterogeneous structures [^0deafad0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The self-assembly of complex structures from a set of non-identical building blocks is a hallmark of soft matter and biological systems, including protein complexes, colloidal clusters, and DNA-based assemblies. Predicting the dependence of the equilibrium assembly yield on the concentrations and interaction energies of building blocks is highly challenging, owing to the difficulty of computing the entropic contributions to the free energy of the many structures that compete with the ground state configuration. While these calculations yield well known results for spherically symmetric building blocks, they do not hold when the building blocks have internal rotational degrees of freedom. Here we present an approach for solving this problem that works with arbitrary building blocks, including proteins with known structure and complex colloidal building blocks. Our algorithm combines classical statistical mechanics with recently developed computational tools for automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation allows efficient evaluation of equilibrium averages over configurations that would otherwise be intractable. We demonstrate the validity of our framework by comparison to molecular dynamics simulations of simple examples, and apply it to calculate the yield curves for known protein complexes and for the assembly of colloidal shells.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^2f24595e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All the simulations started from the crystalline state unless otherwise specified and were performed at each temperature independently. To construct a crystalline structure, the unit-cell structure was first determined and then duplicated along two primary lattice vectors. In our polygonal systems, we determined the unit-cell structure by careful examination on the final structure from the REMD simulations described below. For triangle, the unit-cell contains two monomers with opposite body-orientations, as shown in Fig. 2c; for the other four polygons, the unit-cell is just a monomer. The exact values of the two primary lattice vectors were calculated by geometrical construction, taking the effective radius of each L-J particle into account. For the simulations of the triangular system starting from a crystalline structure with a locally disordered region, the initial configuration is prepared by the following procedure: At a relatively high temperature of T = 2.88, the triangular system becomes amorphous spontaneously. When this happens, we select a snapshot with a small disordered region (about 30 monomers). This snapshot is then used as the initial configuration for related simulations.

Aneurysm diameter measurement is quick and easy, but suffers from the pitfalls of being "too rough and ready". When semi-automated segmentation took 7–10 minutes to estimate volume, it was not a practical tool for busy, routine clinical practice. Today, the availability of automatic segmentation in seconds is bound to make volume measurement, along with 3D ultrasonography, the tools of the future. There can be no debate.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^82717ed8]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In general, the size of the mesoscopic sphere necessary to achieve a given accuracy depends on the structural universality class of the medium and its correlation length, as demonstrated in Figure 8, showing the scaling of the mean squared difference between the model estimate and ground truth. The observed power law decay can be explained from the decay of the structural correlation functionfrom inclusions residing outside the mesoscopic sphere (as derived in Appendix C). Hereis the microstructural dimension whiledenotes the structural exponent.

In Simulation (b), we computed the MRI Larmor frequencyin a sample with a slowly varying magnetic microstructure. This was done using our full model (Equation 21), and compared with a ground truth calculation (Equation 56). Figure 9 shows that the SD of the ratio between the two field estimates decreases when the voxel width compared with the size of the cylinders increases, and confirms that using the full model (Equation 21) on these particular samples can estimate the ground truth MRI Larmor frequency with high accuracy. For example, assuming a radius around 0.5 μm, voxels should ideally be larger than around 20 μm, which is well below standard clinical resolution, if SD should be below 5%. However, as shown in Simulation (a), the deviation would decrease further for higher volume fractions. In addition, neglecting the mesoscopic contribution and using the elementary dipole field instead of the voxel‐averaged one when computing the macroscopic contribution resulted in substantial deviations from ground truth. This underscores that we cannot replace the mesoscopic Lorentz sphere with an empty void, as for the molecular Lorentz cavity. By doing so, we neglect an important contribution to the MRI Larmor frequency.

In Simulation (c), we tested the accuracy of the mesoscopic dipole tensorfor a population of infinitely long cylinders, Equation (43), compared with explicitly calculatingusing Equation (18). Our model agreed with our analytical solution, Equation (43), and previous results for parallel cylinders. The degree of orientation dispersion was varied to make the effect of structural anisotropy clear.

### Space-and time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to probe assembly of silver nanocrystal superlattices [^a8125546]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 5a shows Porod plots (Iq 4 against q) for a nanocrystal solution under a 57 V cm −1 applied field for 55 min. Nanocrystal assembly is negligible in the solution away from the anode by more than 50 µm, and the scattering data are form factors of individual nanocrystals. The black open circles in the plots are the measured scattering data, and the blue curves are the best fits made by assuming a collection of non-interacting solid spheres with a Gaussian size distribution, whererepresents the average diameter and δ its standard deviation, as described in Supplementary Methods. According to the fits, nanocrystals in the solution prior to applying electric fields have a diameter of 7.1 ± 1.1 nm with a polydispersity of 15.5% throughout the entire solution (Supplementary Fig. 8). After applying a field of 57 V cm −1 for 55 min, nanocrystals 50, 500, 1000, and 1400 µm away from the anode have diameters and percent polydispersity of 7.4 ± 0.9 (12.2%), 6.9 ± 1.1 (15.9%), 6.5 ± 1.3 (20.0%), and 5.6 ± 1.5 nm (26.8%), respectively. Larger nanocrystals have been preferentially accumulated near the anode and the size polydispersity has been reduced by 21%, compared to that of the original solution.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^e343ca2d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This implies that we can approximate the operatorwith a total cost of about. This operator agrees with our target operatorat leading order in z, and has an inner-product error of about z 2. This can be improved to z 3 by using the next order in the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, but going to even higher orders becomes prohibitively expensive. It is at this point that we make our heuristic step. In the Euclidean group example, we saw that the complexity geometry has so many degrees of freedom that by making minor deformations of the path we can correct small errors at small extra cost, in a way that is not captured by any finite order of the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, and is instead an emergent feature in the IR. Compared with the SU(2) example in the section ' Berger sphere ', the task of compiling in U(2 N) is complicated by the fact that there are many more directions in which to err; on the other hand, there are correspondingly more directions in which we can wiggle the path to eliminate the error, and as a statistical matter, we expect that to dominate. If the small inner-product errors can be corrected by wiggling the path, then we can synthesizefor z < 1 at cost k n 2 (k). To generateat larger values of z, the triangle inequality (for any) guarantees that the complexity grows no faster than linearly with coefficient k n 2 (k). This argument heuristically shows that the binomial metric is in the same universality class as the infinite-cliff metric, and therefore upper-bounds the critical schedule:The upper-bound equation (17) holds at all but the largest k, where the analysis becomes unreliable. Note also that although the binomial metric does not have a curvature as small as the exponential metric, it is still very moderate ∣ κ ∣ ≤ O (N) compared to the cliff metric. The reasoning that leads to equation (17) is heuristic, because to eliminate error it appeals to a statistical argument. In ref. it is shown that there is a weaker result that can be proved. The study also shows that any unitary that can be reached with a path that in the binomial metric has a lengthcan be approximated to within inner-product error ϵ by a path that in the infinite-cliff metric has a lengthOur conjectures imply that this can be improved from polynomial to linear-with-additive-constant and from approximate to exact.

### Capillary flow experiments for thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of protein liquid-liquid phase separation [^9ab0f4a8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Affinity determination

The capillary is filled with a solution of interaction partner of known concentration. A small injection of 40 nl of the labeled biomolecule + interaction partner is then carried out and it is pushed through the capillary by the solution of interaction partner. The laminar flow in the capillary causes deformation of the plug, which is measured by a fluorescence detector. The degree of this deformation depends on the diffusivity of the labeled biomolecule. Hence, diffusivity is directly measured which can be converted to hydrodynamic radius through the Stokes–Einstein relation. The change in hydrodynamic radius can then be fitted to the binding models described in the following section.

PEG3000 was added to 50 µM Ddx4n1 in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM TCEP to a final concentration of 0–7%. The influence of CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 was investigated at a concentration of 100 µM Ddx4n1 and a bivalent salt concentration between 0 and 10 mM. Influence of protein concentration was investigated at a Ddx4n1 concentration between 100 and 163 µM. The influence of ssDNA was investigated at a concentration of 128 µM Ddx4n1 and an ssDNA concentration between 0 and 30 µM, with the addition of the fluorescent Ddx4n1YFP. Ddx4n1-YFP was added to the 500 µM Ddx4n1 stock solution to a final concentration of 200 Nm (0.5–20 µl). When the Alexa488 labeled DNA was used as indicator it was at a Ddx4n1 concentration of 112 µM, 0–26 µM ssDNA and 0.5% labeled DNA. Fluoresbrite spheres were diluted 4000 times for the 6 µm spheres and 400,000 times for the 1 µm spheres in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl prior to Capflex analysis. For all samples, a capillary of inner diameter of 75 µm and a length of 1 m was used.

### Susceptibility-induced T (2)-shortening and unrestricted diffusion [^81230563]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

In this work, discrepancies between recent theories for susceptibility-induced T(2)-shortening and classical results, namely outer sphere theory and diffusion through local fields with random gradients, are considered. These discrepancies are assigned to the use of unrestricted diffusion in the new theories.

### Pseudometrically constrained centroidal voronoi tessellations: generating uniform antipodally symmetric points on the unit sphere with a novel acceleration strategy and its applications to diffusion and three-dimensional radial MRI [^6a19285a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that uniform sampling measurements that are endowed with antipodal symmetry play an important role in image quality when the raw data and image data are related through the Fourier relationship. Currently, it is extremely challenging to generate large and uniform antipodally symmetric point sets suitable for three-dimensional radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this long-standing problem in a unique and optimal way.

Methods

The proposed method is based on constrained centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric.

Results

The time complexity of the proposed tessellations was shown to be effectively linear, i.e., on the order of the number of sampling measurements. For small sample size, the proposed method was comparable with the state-of-the-art method (a direct iterative minimization of the electrostatic potential energy of a collection of electrons antipodal-symmetrically distributed on the unit sphere) in terms of the sampling uniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is infeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak and ringing artifacts, when compared with those of the commonly used methods.

Conclusion

This work proposed a unique and optimal approach to solving a long-standing problem in generating uniform sampling points for three-dimensional radial MRI.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^0a807599]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Typically, such image-based analyses are based on implicit, a priori, assumptions of the macroscopic symmetry of the system. These approaches fail when multiple crystallographic phases and/or extended defects are present. Finding atoms without a reference to a global lattice is a general particle search problem, a well explored area with multiple available algorithms. That said, adaptation of these algorithms to an atom search is non-trivial, especially when multiple atom types are present. Other approaches circumvent atom finding by analysis of image segments that contain features of interest to extract relevant information. However, contrast-based image analysis methods are prone to error propagation, especially in the case of lower-quality images, significant computational time cost for large images and multiple image arrays, and rather extensive user involvement and expertise. Notably, steps have been taken to ameliorate these complications through the use of correcting algorithms including parameters such as orientation of the detector and environmental distortions. These image processing techniques are quite powerful and ensure maximal data veracity before the analysis is initiated. Conjoined with such a powerful and extensive suite of image processing software, contrast-based methods have achieved impressive results that extend into the realm of three-dimensional reconstruction and internal structure mapping.

Nevertheless, once all atoms are found, a bigger challenge arises: without the global lattice as an intuitive vehicle for interpretation of the local structural data, we need to find completely new ways to categorize, analyse and interpret. Here we aim to explore whether a universal physical description of the system, including local and global symmetries, phases, and topological defects, can be built up only from the local information, obviating the overall lattice structure. We propose an approach based on the multivariate statistical analysis of the coordination spheres of individual atoms, made up by an array of values that represent a variety of metrics between an atom and its nearest or next nearest neighbours, to reveal preferential structures and symmetries. We test this approach on a mixed-phase system with a variety of nearest neighbour environments and show how a framework for interpretation of this new type of structural data can be developed.

The capacity for self-renewal is thought to be a critical property of tumor-initiating cells. This capacity is often associated with the ability to generate spheres in vitro. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Barrett et al. show that cells lacking sphere-forming ability can still be very efficient at propagating tumors.

### Finding defects in glasses through machine learning [^a51d17fc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Iterative training procedure

We finally introduce an approach to optimally employ our ML model to process new data: the iterative training procedure. To produce the results reported in Fig. 3 we trained the model once using a subset of the already available data. This is a natural way to proceed when the goal is to process new data that are very similar to the training set, and the training set is itself large enough. However, since the goal of the proposed ML model is to ultimately drive the landscape exploration and collect new samples, the single-training approach may encounter two types of problems. First, at the beginning there may be not enough data and, second, the findings of the model do not provide any additional feedback.

To solve both problems we introduce the iterative training procedure. The idea of iterative training is to use the predictive power of ML to create and expand its own training set, consequently enhancing its performance by iteratively retraining over the new data. Compared to standard active learning methods, iterative training does not focus on new samples with the highest model uncertainty, but instead it iterates the predictions on the samples below the threshold of interest. Details on the method and parameters are discussed in Supplementary Note 3. In practice, we start from a training set of K 0 ~ 10 3 −10 4 randomly selected pairs to have an initial idea of the relation between input and output. We then use the ML approach outlined in Fig. 2 to predict the K i = 500 pairs with the lowest QS. For these TLS candidates, we perform the full procedure to calculate the true QS and determine whether the pair is a DW or a TLS. In the Supplementary Fig. 6, we report the result of this procedure when we process a new set of trajectories from the same polydisperse soft sphere potential as in ref. In general the first few iterations of iterative training have a poor performance. In fact, we find that > 70% of the first K i pairs are actually non-DW. After collecting additional K i measurements, we retrain the model. We report in Tab. 2 the average time for each step of the ML procedure. The retraining can be done in ~10 min, after which the model is able to predict the next K i pairs with lowest QS. Overall, to process N ISpairs we estimate that the computational time of the iterative approach is. If N ISpairs > 10 9 it is possible to significantly reduce t i by permanently discarding the worst pairs, but this is not needed here. We iterate this procedure N i t e r times, until the last batch of K i candidates contains less than 1% of the total number of TLS. We believe that continuing this iterative procedure would lead to the identification of even more TLS/DW, but this is out of the scope of this paper.

### Structured multimaterial filaments for 3D printing of optoelectronics [^2df16233]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Final light-emitting filament

The filament consists of a multimaterial functional domain (FD) that comprises of an active light-emitting wire that has a 0.20 mm-diameter inner copper electrode, layered by an 18 µm-thick dielectric and lastly capped by an 18 µm-thick electroluminescent (EL) ZnS-phosphor outer layer. A conductive tungsten electrode (diameter of 50 µm) is spaced 0.05–0.1 mm away from the ZnS, and a 40 µm-diameter conductive BiSn cylindrical core is centrally situated with no connection to tungsten and ZnS. The 0.5–0.7 mm diameter material polycarbonate (PC) holds all of these materials and interfaces in position. Lastly, a 0.2–0.4 mm thick cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), which envelopes the cylindrical polycarbonate core, serves as the printable thermoplastic.

Laser-induced capillary breakup

The laser used here has a wavelength of 808 nm, spot size of 50 µm, operating at pulse mode with frequency of 5 kHz and a duty of 2%. The fiber is translated at a speed of 1.4–2.8 µm/s relative to the laser. This wavelength is chosen because the polycarbonate cladding is transparent to the laser. Thus, we can achieve the effect of "inside-out" heating", in which the filament is not deformed from Rayleigh instability, thus retaining its cylindrical shell necessary for the print process. Focusing the laser onto the BiSn metal core, BiSn absorbs the energy and becomes heated. The heat is being transferred to surrounding polycarbonate. The temperature of the surrounding polycarbonate increases beyond its glass transition temperature, decreasing its viscosity. The formation of flowy PC matrix helps shape the BiSn core into thermodynamically-stable spheres. Using a laser set-up also allows one to obtain spheres only at desired localized spatial positions along the length of the fiber. This can be done by translating the fiber to the position desired while the laser position is fixed. Smaller pixel-spheres can be attained by reducing the spacing between the tungsten wire and the phosphor surface. Higher pixel density can be achieved by increasing the diameter of the BiSn cylinder while keeping the spacing between the tungsten and phosphor surface constant.

### Analogue of dynamic hall effect in cavity magnon polariton system and coherently controlled logic device [^c2b3df58]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Device description

The cross-cavity with planar dimensions 40 × 40 mm was fabricated on a very low-loss laminate substrate with a dielectric constant of 2.20 ± 0.02 over a wide frequency range. The thickness of the substrate was 1.57 ± 0.05 mm with a copper thickness of 17.5 μm on both sides. The fabricated cavity includes two identical orthogonal half-wavelength microstrip line resonators that have a length and width of 20 and 1 mm, respectively. The coupling gap between the feed lines and the resonator was 2.0 mm. This value controls the quality factor of the cavity and has been optimized using electromagnetic simulations.

A 1 mm diameter YIG sphere is located in the intersection of the cross-cavity. The YIG magnon mode follows the Kittel dispersion equation, where μ 0 is the vacuum permeability, γ = 2 π × 26.0 GHz T −1 is the gyromagnetic ratio and μ 0 H a = 3.0 mT is the anisotropy field of the YIG sphere. The static magnetic field H is applied perpendicularly to the plane of the cross-cavity.

Measurement setup

The frequency spectra are measured using a vector network analyzer with an input power of −5 dBm. Through a feedline port, microwave transmission is characterized, and the external coupling strength between the feedline port and the X-cavity is measured to be. In the section demonstrating polaritonic logic device, the microwave are divided into two paths to excite the X-cavity with a relative phase delay. By inserting a phase shift into one path, the quantity of the phase delay can be precisely tuned.

Theory

Details about the theory of X-CMP transport are provided in Supplementary Notes 1, 2, and 3.

### Phase nucleation in curved space [^e8324386]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Nucleation and growth is the dominant relaxation mechanism driving first-order phase transitions. In two-dimensional flat systems, nucleation has been applied to a wide range of problems in physics, chemistry and biology. Here we study nucleation and growth of two-dimensional phases lying on curved surfaces and show that curvature modifies both critical sizes of nuclei and paths towards the equilibrium phase. In curved space, nucleation and growth becomes inherently inhomogeneous and critical nuclei form faster on regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Substrates of varying shape display complex energy landscapes with several geometry-induced local minima, where initially propagating nuclei become stabilized and trapped by the underlying curvature.

### A statistical solution to the chaotic, non-hierarchical three-body problem [^7dff7dc7]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The three-body problem is arguably the oldest open question in astrophysics and has resisted a general analytic solution for centuries. Various implementations of perturbation theory provide solutions in portions of parameter space, but only where hierarchies of masses or separations exist. Numerical integrations 1 show that bound, non-hierarchical triple systems of Newtonian point particles will almost 2 always disintegrate into a single escaping star and a stable bound binary 3,4, but the chaotic nature of the three-body problem 5 prevents the derivation of tractable 6 analytic formulae that deterministically map initial conditions to final outcomes. Chaos, however, also motivates the assumption of ergodicity 7–9, implying that the distribution of outcomes is uniform across the accessible phase volume. Here we report a statistical solution to the non-hierarchical three-body problem that is derived using the ergodic hypothesis and that provides closed-form distributions of outcomes (for example, binary orbital elements) when given the conserved integrals of motion. We compare our outcome distributions to large ensembles of numerical three-body integrations and find good agreement, so long as we restrict ourselves to 'resonant' encounters 10 (the roughly 50 per cent of scatterings that undergo chaotic evolution). In analysing our scattering experiments, we identify 'scrambles' (periods of time in which no pairwise binaries exist) as the key dynamical state that ergodicizes a non-hierarchical triple system. The generally super-thermal distributions of survivor binary eccentricity that we predict have notable applications to many astrophysical scenarios. For example, non-hierarchical triple systems produced dynamically in globular clusters are a primary formation channel for black-hole mergers 11–13, but the rates and properties 14,15 of the resulting gravitational waves depend on the distribution of post-disintegration eccentricities.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^2d2d6711]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Three‐axis measurement based on diameters (Eqn. 5)

For this LVV estimate, the short‐axis slice was identified that had the largest orthogonal in‐plane diameters. These diameters were multiplied by the length from each of the 12 long‐axis slices to get 12 independent estimates of the LVV. The results are shown in Figure 7 C and Table 4. The LVEF error for the first long‐axis slice was 23.6% (an underestimation). The mean and SD in LVEF error over all 12 slices was −32.8 ± 10.7%. The LV volume was consistently underestimated and the measurement uncertainty was 21% when using this approach.

Single long‐axis view area‐length method (Eqn. 6)

This method relies on only a single long‐axis image to compute the in‐plane area and longitudinal extent. The results are shown in Figure 7 D and Table 4. The LVEF measurement uncertainty is ≈40% when using this approach.

Bi‐plane long‐axis area‐length (Eqn. 7) and the Dodge‐Sandler correction (Eqn. (8))

For these methods, the in‐plane cavity area from each of 2 orthogonal long‐axis slices was combined via the respective equations. Six sets of measures were made, from orthogonal pairs of the 12 available long‐axis slices. The results are shown in Figure 7 E and 7 F, and Table 4. Using Equation 7, the LVEF % error ranged from 5.5 to 29.0, with mean and SD error of 16.7 ± 10.0%. With the Dodge‐Sandler correction the LVEF % error ranged from 13.5 to 39.7, with mean ± SD error of 26.0 ± 11.1%. LVV was consistently underestimated and the LVEF measurement uncertainties were 20% and 22% when using these methods.

Teichholz's formula (Eqn. (9))

The greatest short‐axis diameter seen on a long‐axis slice was used to compute the LV cavity volume via Equation (11). The results are shown in Figure 7 G and Table 4. The LVEF % error ranged from −52.4 to 36.3, with mean ± SD error of 10.3 ± 23.0%. The LV volume was consistently overestimated and the LVEF measurement uncertainty was ≈46%.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### A contrast-oriented algorithm for FDG-PET-based delineation of tumour volumes for the radiotherapy of lung cancer: derivation from phantom measurements and validation in patient data [^b24ed21b]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

An easily applicable algorithm for the FDG-PET-based delineation of tumour volumes for the radiotherapy of lung cancer was developed by phantom measurements and validated in patient data.

Methods

PET scans were performed (ECAT-ART tomograph) on two cylindrical phantoms (phan1, phan2) containing glass spheres of different volumes (7.4–258 ml) which were filled with identical FDG concentrations. Gradually increasing the activity of the fillable background, signal-to-background ratios from 33:1 to 2.5:1 were realised. The mean standardised uptake value (SUV) of the region-of-interest (ROI) surrounded by a 70% isocontour (mSUV(70)) was used to represent the FDG accumulation of each sphere (or tumour). Image contrast was defined as C = (mSUV(70)-BG)/BG where BG is the mean background - SUV. For the spheres of phan1, the threshold SUVs (TS) best matching the known sphere volumes were determined. A regression function representing the relationship between TS/(mSUV(70) - BG) and C was calculated and used for delineation of the spheres in phan2 and the gross tumour volumes (GTVs) of eight primary lung tumours. These GTVs were compared to those defined using CT.

Results

The relationship between TS/(mSUV(70) - BG) and C is best described by an inverse regression function which can be converted to the linear relationship TS = a x mSUV(70)+b x BG. Using this algorithm, the volumes delineated in phan2 differed by only -0.4 to +0.7 mm in radius from the true ones, whilst the PET-GTVs differed by only -0.7 to +1.2 mm compared with the values determined by CT.

Conclusion

By the contrast-oriented algorithm presented in this study, a PET-based delineation of GTVs for primary tumours of lung cancer patients is feasible.

### Solving the where problem and quantifying geometric variation in neuroanatomy using generative diffeomorphic mapping [^e40ef6d2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

A current focus of research in neuroscience is to enumerate, map and annotate neuronal cell types in entire vertebrate brains, particularly mouse. To facilitate this, neuroanatomical atlases have been developed to establish predefined coordinate systems and corresponding images –. Mapping data from experimental observations to these reference coordinates enables statistical ensembles to be built from multiple samples and multiple laboratories, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a–e. This mapping problem is generally approached through image registration, which is well established for the case of high quality samples and images acquired from the same modality. In modern neuroscience heterogeneous images are produced leading to four main challenges to registration as shown in Fig. 1 f–i. Images may be 2D or 3D, and tissue may have dramatically different shapes associated to different preparations. Imaging modalities are continually being developed, and include different contrast mechanisms from reference atlases, and neuroimages include substantially different signals from reference atlases, such as experiment-specific fluorescence signals, damaged or missing tissue, or other artifacts.

### Left-right-alternating theta sweeps in entorhinal-hippocampal maps of space [^7132af48]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The linear track task

Five rats with MEC–parasubiculum implants, of which two also had hippocampal implants, shuttled back and forth on a 200 cm linear track with liquid rewards delivered at each end (chocolate-flavoured oat milk dispensed by tube). When the rat consumed a reward at one end of the track, the reward port at the opposite end was refilled. Before surgery, rats were trained on the track task until they consistently completed around 40 laps in one training session. Recording sessions lasted 45–66 min, with 18–48 min of running between reward sites.

The wagon-wheel task

Two rats with MEC–parasubiculum implants were tested on a wagon-wheel track, an elevated circular track 10 cm wide with two perpendicular cross-linking arms spanning the diameter of the circle. The track was fitted with eight reward wells, placed halfway between each of the five junctions. Each of the wells could be filled with chocolate oat milk by attached tubing. At any given time, a pseudorandom subset of 1–4 of the wells was filled to encourage steady exploration of the entire maze. Before surgery, the rats were trained to asymptotic performance levels, for which they obtained at least 30 rewards per 30-min session.

The m-maze task

One rat with probes implanted in the hippocampus and the MEC–parasubiculum was tested on an m-shaped maze, consisting of a central arm connected to two side arms through a T junction (arm lengths of 1.2 m, a T length 1.1 m and a track width of 10 cm). Reward wells were placed at the ends of each arm and were remotely filled with a liquid reward. The rat was trained to visit each of the side arms alternately, returning to the central arm between each visit to the side arms (centre–right–centre–left–centre–right and so on), receiving rewards at the end of each successful trajectory. Before being exposed to the m-maze, the rat was trained to shuttle back and forth on a linear track daily for around a week with multiple sessions each day. After 2–3 days with repeated exposure to the m-maze, the rat displayed almost perfect task performance and was implanted. The data shown in Extended Data Fig. 8 were obtained during the night after surgery.

### Spatially fractionated radiation therapy in sarcomas: a large single-institution experience [^ed8d288a]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

Patients

Sarcoma patients with metastatic disease or unresectable localized disease treated with SFRT from December 1, 2019, through June 1, 2022, at Mayo Clinic Rochester were retrospectively reviewed on an institutional review board–approved protocol. Use of SFRT for advanced sarcomas was at physician discretion. In general, SFRT was recommended when the intent of treatment was to elicit reduction in tumor size, provide durable local control, and/or provide symptom relief in tumors not amenable to stereotactic body radiation therapy. A total of 53 patients with 61 SFRT treatments were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with palliative intent in the setting of metastatic disease with the purpose of tumor response and symptom relief. Patients were treated with curative intent in the setting of localized, unresectable disease primarily to optimize local control.

SFRT therapy

All patients received SFRT as the sole therapy or before a course of consolidative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). SFRT was delivered using brass, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) lattice, or proton therapy techniques as previously described by our institution, including dose to organs at risk. The recommended prescription dose was 16 to 20 Gy delivered in a single fraction based on the report from Mohiuddin et al that a higher response rate is seen with an SFRT dose of ≥ 15 Gy. In general, 20 Gy was administered whenever feasible. 16 to 18 Gy was administered when the tumor was in close proximity to normal tissues sensitive to RT (eg, bowel).

In general, brass GRID plans used a commercial brass block (.decimal) to deliver a single static field with either a 6 or 10 MV beam. The diameter of the holes at isocenter was 1.4 cm and were spaced 2.1 cm center-to-center in a hexagonal pattern. VMAT plans used 2 to 4 arcs and 6 MV flatting filter free beams. Spherical lattice points were placed throughout the physician contoured gross tumor volume (GTV) and optimized using 3 concentric ring structures to confine the highest doses to the center of the spheres and maximize dose sparing between the spheres. Sphere placement followed guidelines of a 1 to 1.5 cm sphere diameter, 2 to 3 cm sphere center-to-center separation, and sphere edge placement at least 1 cm away from any organ at risk. For proton SFRT, one field with a hexagonal spot scanning pattern was first applied. This was followed by a 2-step optimization process to reduce both the spot spacing and tubular shaped dose regions to a 1 cm radius.

Materials and methods

Data were acquired on a variety of PET scanners (Table 1) from the major vendors, with a number of different reconstructions from systems equipped both with and without time of flight (ToF) and resolution recovery (RR). Each site followed an identical experimental protocol utilizing the NEMA 2007/IEC 2008 PET Body Phantom (Data Spectrum Corporation, NC), with a volume of about 10 L containing a "cold" (nonradioactive) solid insert (diameter 51 mm) and six fillable spheres of various diameters (∅ 10, 13, 17, 22, 28 and 37 mm) filled to an approximate eight-to-one sphere-to-background ratio with 90 Y-chloride (YCl 3) provided in a constant specific activity (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

a Including two systems with the new continuous bed motion technology

Each site was required to measure the phantom volume and the delivered 90 Y solution in the departmental dose calibrator for comparison with the shipping certificate. The entire delivery vial was added to a volume of 1,300 ml, and this solution was used to fill the phantom spheres, before the reminder of solution was added to the background compartment, with the addition of EDTA/DTPA to the contents to prevent the YCl 3 sticking to the phantom walls. This allowed an eight-to-one sphere-to-background ratio, in keeping with the NEMA NU 2–2007 image quality guidelines, and was thought to require minimal phantom manipulation and activity handling at sites. Residual in the vial was estimated through re-measuring the vial in the dose calibrator after reconstitution to the initial volume with water. Residual in the needle and syringe was taken as negligible.

### Solving conformal defects in 3D conformal field theory using fuzzy sphere regularization [^6df0cfb3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients.

### Neurons exploit stochastic growth to rapidly and economically build dense dendritic arbors [^65c721f6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The mean-field model reveals that arbor expansion is driven by length fluctuations.

a Measured arbor diameters are plotted from 24–120 h AEL along the anterior-posterior (AP) and left-right (LR) axes. Growth initiates at 16 h AEL from a soma of size 10 µm (black hollow circle). Cubic regressions used to fit the front speed are shown in solid lines. b Dendrite length density along the LR axis is normalized by its central density. Solid lines show the mean front profiles at 24 (red), 48 (purple), and 96 (yellow) hours AEL, averaged from individual neuron front profiles shown in faded lines aligned at 10% of their central length density. The lower 25% of the densities are fitted with exponential functions (dashed lines) to estimate the decay length. c Allowed values of the front speedand decay lengthby Eq. (16). The marginally stable solution coincides with the global minimum of the front speed confined on the-curve (solid circles). The average measured front speed and decay length along the LR axis are visualized by solid triangles. d Numerical solutions of the dendrite density at 1600 min from an initial isotropic sigmoid front of radius ~10 µm. The computation uses parameters at 48 h AEL. e, f Front speed and front decay length from measurements along AP and LR axes, theoretical predictions, and numerical solutions at 24, 48, and 96 h AEL. All errors are standard deviations. Those for the theory are estimated by bootstrapping (Methods: Statistical Analysis).

To predict the front speed and decay length, we solved Eqs. (1)-(3) in a co-moving frame. To facilitate solution, we made three well-justified assumptions in the distal front: we omitted the internal dendrite density (because terminal branches are in the majority), we dropped the collision term (because it is second order in density, which is small), we set the radial transport termto zero (because it decays as). Using an exponential trial solution, we obtained a constraint Eq. (16) on the allowed values ofversusas shown in Fig. 6c. The marginally stable solutionmust satisfy. This condition pinpoints the emerging front speedas the minimal speed along the-curve, which corresponds to a singular solution for the decay length.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^d6563994]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative imaging (QI) — challenges and sources of error emphasize that advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms and distilled into selected "biomarkers" to evaluate their ability to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, and emergent QI metrics vary among centers in the methods of acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation; technological advances contribute to difficulty in standardization. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including 1) technical issues (e.g., depth of inspiration, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution), 2) nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest (e.g., comparing regions, lobes, or airways), and 3) lack of a well-defined reference space, as well as 4) inaccurate landmark coregistration for evaluating paired images obtained at different lung volumes and 5) failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Imagining a way out of the gravity bias: preschoolers can visualize the solution to a spatial problem [^1d4e57db]. Child Development (2011). Low credibility.

Can young children visualize the solution to a difficult spatial problem? Forty-eight 3-year-olds were tested in a spatial reasoning paradigm in which they were asked to predict the path of a ball moving through 1 of 3 intertwined tubes. One group of children was asked to visualize the ball rolling down the tube before they made their predictions, a second group was given identical instructions without being asked to use visual imagery, and a third group was given no instructions. Children in the visualization condition performed significantly better than those in the other conditions, suggesting that encouraging young children to use visual imagery may help them to reason through difficult problems.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^66cbd16d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative imaging metrics for pulmonary assessment — precision, bias, and unbiased sampling are defined with study design implications. "Bias" refers to systematic errors leading to inaccuracy, whereas "Precision" refers to measurement reproducibility and depends mainly on sampling design and sample characteristics; bias cannot be detected or reduced by more measurements and is avoided a priori by rigorous design using unbiased methods. In a well-designed study, precision is tuned so the within-subject coefficient of error ("noise") is significantly smaller than between-subject biological variation ("signal"). Unbiased sampling designs guarantee statistically representative samples and generally must be spatially randomized, with available approaches including systematic uniform random sampling, isotropic uniform random sampling, stratified sampling, fractionator sampling, and proportionator sampling. The report cautions that voxel-by-voxel automated image analysis ensures neither accuracy nor precision and does not remove the need to follow stereological sampling principles, and illustrates applications where systematic sampling of micro-CT images has been used to compare surface versus core alveoli and to correlate ex vivo small airway gas trapping with in vivo tissue measurements in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to characterize terminal bronchiole loss, narrowing, and obstruction.

### Mimicking focused ultrasound with a loop coil in acoustic radiation force imaging [^d0c447d5]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Full‐width‐at‐half‐maximum simulation

Figure 3 shows how the FWHM of thefield measured in a slice parallel to a loop coil depends on the coil's radius and distance of the slice from the coil. Combinations of coil radius and slice distance that result in constant FWHM are depicted with isocontours. Tracing each contour from left to right along the slice distance axis, the teardrop shape of the coil's dipole field is reflected in the upward slope of each contour, until it rapidly drops off starting at a slice distance of approximately 2/3 the coil diameter. A FWHM of 20 mm can be achieved with a coil diameter of 20 mm, 13.3 mm from the coil as well as with a 10 mm diameter, 19 mm from the coil. A larger FWHM of 30 mm can be achieved with a coil diameter of 30 mm and a slice position 19 mm from the coil, as well as with a coil diameter of 10 mm, and 29 mm from the surface of the coil.

Calculations were made over a range of coil diameters from 5 to 50 mm and transverse slice distance 5 to 70 mm away from the surface of the DC loop. Isocontours are shown at 10 mm FWHM intervals, where the left‐most contour represents a 10 mm FWHM, and the right‐most contour represents a 70 mm FWHM. A white "x" indicates the 20.5 mm FWHM of the 2‐turn, 20 mm‐diameter loop at a slice distance of 15 mm from the coil's surface.

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^da58db0d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Linear, planar and cluster conformations for colloids in a vesicle.

Experimental images obtained through a combination of bright-field and confocal microscopy, along with simulation snapshots, representing cluster, plate, and linear configurations. The insets provide schematic representations of the cluster arrangement observed in experiments. The scale bars in all experimental images are 5 μ m.

Additionally, we find bistable regions due to the combined membrane, shape, and solvent fluctuations driven by the colloids inside the vesicle. These regions are identified in simulations by calculating the order parameter κ 2 as a function of time. Fig. 1 (j, k) demonstrate bistability between linear-plate and plate-cluster conformations, respectively, for N = 4, where we can clearly see that the order parameter κ 2 fluctuates between the values corresponding to the different conformations. We denote these bistable state points as left and right green triangles in the state diagram in Fig. 1 (a). Fig. 1 (b–i) show time-lapse snapshots of a bistable state point in both experiments and simulations, where we observe that a vesicle in an initial planar configuration transitions to a linear conformation (Movie S2). The transition is reversible as the colloids return to a planar conformation at longer times. To highlight the robustness of our methods, we convincingly demonstrate the transition of the particles from a linear arrangement to a clustered state both in simulations and experiments. This transition is achieved by precisely controlling the surface area-to-volume ratio of the vesicle through osmotic imbalances across the membrane, as depicted in Fig. S3 and Movie S3.

As mentioned earlier, the reduced volume ν also provides insight in the packing behavior of the colloids when the surface area of the vesicles remains constant. Although it is challenging to meet this requirement in experiments at fixed N, in simulations the surface area values for the vesicles remain nearly constant for a given N (see Table S1). As a result, our in silico realization of the finite sphere packing problem unequivocally confirms that packing efficiency is maximized in the linear conformation when compared to the plate or cluster arrangements, as evidenced by the consistently lower values of ν observed across all values of N. To emphasize this aspect, we present a state diagram in Fig. S1 that explicitly reports the packing fraction for the state points analyzed in the simulations. We also note that the packing efficiency significantly increases as the number of colloids enclosed within the flexible container increases.

### Arrays of giant octagonal and square cylinders by liquid crystalline self-assembly of X-shaped polyphilic molecules [^f105c6e2]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Nanopatterning by molecular self-assembly has been a topic of intense research in pursuit of 'bottom-up' methods of generating structures for use in nanotechnology. The systems most widely studied have been two- and three-dimensional morphologies of block copolymers. However, T- and X-shaped polyphilic liquid crystals have recently been shown to have great potential for generating soft honeycomb-like structures, surpassing those of polymers in both complexity and degree of order. The cell cross-section of the liquid crystals honeycombs has so far been limited by small molecular size. Here we overcome this limitation by exploiting the inability of the polyphiles to simultaneously achieve optimal packing and complete nanophase separation. This frustration results in a two-dimensional periodic honeycomb consisting of giant octagonal and square cylinders with circumferences of 12 and 8 molecules, respectively. In addition to forming large cells, the two-molecule-long bendy walls give this structure extra versatility and stability.

### Data handling in radiation therapy in the age of image-guided radiation therapy [^a798f736]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) in the modern sense includes large volumetric image sets and high-resolution planar images. In addition to the issue of the sheer size of the data under consideration in IGRT is the critical need for the data to be available in the necessary situation in a timely and reliable fashion. Standards exist for the format of much of the data needed to perform IGRT, but the information workflow is not "standardized" (formal or ad hoc) and details of the use of the standards are only recently being constrained to ensure interoperability. Depending on the interpretation of the scope of IGRT or the desired workflow of the IGRT system, not all of the information that needs to be exchanged between systems is yet standardized nor is the means to exchange the information. The organization of the different types of data needed for IGRT for easy navigation is addressed by commercially available products from multiple vendors; however, this is also an area in which standards and consistency in the clinical environment are catching up to the market. The critical questions a clinician needs answers to include the following: (1) What kinds of data will I need to store and communicate between the pieces of my IGRT system? (2) How much storage will I need to address the volumes of data produced? (3) How long do I need to store (and be able to access) the data? (4) How will the pieces of my IGRT system communicate the necessary information between them (what standards or technical frameworks apply and do the pieces conform or adhere to them)? (5) What are the time constraints on getting information from "where it is" to "where it needs to be"? and (6) Is my IGRT system as a whole capable of providing me with the workflow necessary for my clinical environment or, alternatively, what do the providers of my IGRT system need to do to enable my required workflow? The body of this article examines these issues in greater detail to enable clinicians and clinical support personnel to frame the questions in a practical manner and develop answers that assist in the successful deployment of IGRT.

### Observation and control of casimir effects in a sphere-plate-sphere system [^5ddfd725]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The interaction between three objects give rise to many fascinating phenomena such as chaos of astronomical objects, Efimov bound states of ultracold atoms, and frustrated states of quantum spin systems. It is intriguing to consider the potential of three-body interactions arising solely from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations (virtual photons) –. As quantum electromagnetic fluctuations exist everywhere in the universe and in human-made devices, the Casimir effect is ubiquitous. However, the Casimir effect is often neglected or treated as a detrimental effect in micro-electromechanical systems and nano-electromechanical systems. It will be beneficial to develop useful applications of the Casimir effect. One application of the Casimir effect is to provide a new approach to couple mechanical resonators. Different from optomechanical coupling with real photons in cavity optomechanics –, optomechanical coupling with virtual photons will not suffer from cavity loss and thus will not require a high-quality cavity. Compared to electrostatic coupling, the Casimir effect does not require charge and will work for both conductors and insulators. Compared to the optical force, the Casimir force works for both transparent and opaque materials. Meanwhile, the use of the Casimir force does not prevent the use of the electrostatic force and the optical force. They may be combined to achieve more advanced functions. In addition, the Casimir effect is energy efficient as it does not require a voltage source or a light source to maintain, which will be particularly important for devices operating in the quantum regime at low temperatures.

Recently, the Casimir effect was used to increase the quality factor of a mechanical resonatorand couple two separate mechanical resonators. In addition, the Casimir effect has been utilized to realize nonlinear oscillation, quantum trapping and self-assembling. While the paradigm of Casimir effect between two objects has been extensively explored –, the Casimir force between three macroscopic objects has not been detected yet. The Casimir effect between three objects will be important in studying gravity at short distances as a metal film is often used to separate two test masses to shield electrostatic interactions –. Precision measurement of the Casimir effect has been used to search for a new force beyond the standard model. Beyond its fundamental interest, a Casimir system with three objects can open the route to realize crucial technological building blocks such as a transistor-like three-terminal device with quantum vacuum fluctuations.

### Spatially fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (lattice) for large tumors [^a1713d86]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

This study was approved by our institutional review board. We retrospectively identified 12 large tumors > 10 cm in 11 patients previously treated at our institution. Patient and tumor characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record. A step-by-step guide to the Lattice SBRT contouring and treatment planning process is available in Supplementary Material E1. The Lattice SBRT prescription was created on the assumption that the tumor planning target volume (PTV) should receive at least a standard 5-fraction palliative dose of 2000 cGy. Spatially fractionated techniques have traditionally created a peak–valley dose gradient of approximately 100% to 30%; therefore, a simultaneous integrated boost of 6670 cGy was selected as a Lattice boost dose prescription.

To generate the desired high-gradient dose distribution, our Lattice SBRT technique uses a geometric arrangement of spherical vertices, each with a diameter of 1.5 cm, 6-cm center-to-center spacing, and separation of 3.0 cm between each successive axial plane of spheres. A representative schematic is shown in Figure 1. The selection of these Lattice SBRT planning technique dimensions was based on previously published approaches, which used boost target vertices of 1 to 2 cm in diameter, spaced 2 to 3 cm apart throughout the gross tumor volume (GTV). These vertices are defined within a physician-contoured GTV (GTV_2000), which included all visually identifiable gross disease. The GTV_2000 was expanded by 0.5 to 1.0 cm to create the PTV_2000, which was to receive 2000 cGy in 5 fractions. To generate the geometric lattice, the axial plane with the largest cross dimension within the GTV_2000 was first selected. Then, a 3 × 3 × 3 cm grid guide was overlaid on the GTV_2000, and the high-dose target vertices were placed at the grid intersections using a 1.5 cm diameter 3-dimensional brush to create the PTV_6670. The PTV_6670 high-dose target vertices were alternated with 1.5 cm diameter avoidance vertices (ie, PTV_Avoid) such that the center of a PTV_6670 vertex was 3 cm apart from a PTV_Avoid vertex. This process was repeated every 3 cm in the superior–inferior direction with vertices offset by 3.0 cm with respect to axial slices above and below. All PTV_6670 vertices extending outside of a 5 mm contraction of the GTV_2000 were completely removed to minimize spill of the 30 Gy isodose volume outside the PTV_2000. Additionally, any PTV_6670 vertices located within 1.5 cm of an OAR were completely removed to limit the dose to normal tissue given any uncertainties at the time of treatment. Finally, a PTV_Control structure was made by expanding PTV_6670 by 8 mm and subtracting this from PTV_2000, and was used to assess dose falloff between adjacent PTV_6670 vertices.

### Dynamic changes in microvascular flow conductivity and perfusion after myocardial infarction shown by image-based modeling [^a3c23af1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the response of microvessels to vasodilation depends inversely on their diameter (ie, smaller vessels dilate more than larger ones), 41 we performed additional simulations where the percentage of the increase in diameter depends on the initial vessel diameter. More precisely, we assumed that the maximum vasodilation by a 10%, 20%, and 30% increase in vessel diameter was reached for the smallest microvessels (diameter 0.4 μm), whereas the percentage of change in diameter linearly reduced for larger microvessels, reaching zero for the largest microvessels (diameter 20 μm). The results obtained using this diameter‐dependent vasodilation profile were similar to those considering the same response from all vessels independent of their diameter; k 11, k 22, and k 33 increased by 92.8 ± 110.53%, 151.74 ± 366.54%, and 66.75 ± 41.2%, respectively, for 10% peak dilation; by 396.68 ± 370.2%, 541.71 ± 1021.51%, and 265.77 ± 109.5% for 20% peak dilation; and by 1042.64 ± 917.98%, 1310.68 ± 2160.31%, and 675.01 ± 271.37% for 30% peak vasodilation.

Constriction of diameters of all microvessels by 10% resulted in a decrease of the diagonal elements (k 11, k 22, and k 33) by mean percentages of 24.97%, 1.35%, and 26.20%, respectively. Further constriction of the vessels by an additional 10% led to a decrease of the elements by 67.34%, 50.40%, and 67.10%, respectively. When constriction reached 30%, the decrease of the permeability tensor values was ≈100% for all 3 elements. Interestingly, when 20% constriction is applied to a varying percentage of vessels randomly chosen, the direction of the change might be either positive or negative, with the overall trend of change resulting positive. This indicates that there are cases in which constriction in certain vessels could cause an increase in blood flow.

### Evolutionary rescue of resistant mutants is governed by a balance between radial expansion and selection in compact populations [^0256ccc3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Evolutionary rescue and treatment failure in an in silico tumor model

To assess the relevance of our findings in the context of solid tumors, we conducted agent-based simulation of tumor growth using a tailored implementation of the PhysiCell platform. In short, cells grow and divide in an explicitly simulated nutrient microenvironment and repulsively interact via a distance-dependent force, resulting in non-motile, overdamped motion (Fig. 6 a). In our implementation, individual cells can additionally mutate at a predetermined stochastic rate and fitness effect. Cells in the population interior stop proliferating due to a lack of nutrients, creating a peripheral growth layer.

### Creating a library of generalized fourier sampling patterns for irregular 2D regions of support [^ad8490e3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Multiple-region MRI (mrMRI) represents a generalization of the Shannon sampling theorem to permit sparse k-space sampling whenever the scanned object or its high-contrast edges are confined to multiple known regions. Use of an optimal mrMRI sampling pattern produces an image with root-mean-squared (RMS) noise over the supporting regions equal to the RMS noise in a conventional Fourier image with the same total area of support. Analytical solutions for such sampling patterns have been described previously for all arrangements of two or three (noncollinear) supporting regions. This work describes a robust numerical method for creating a library of optimal and near-optimal mrMRI sampling patterns for more complicated geometries. The average noise amplification over all sampling patterns in the demonstration library was only 4%, with 30% of the sampling patterns resulting in no noise amplification whatsoever.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### Arbitrary lattice symmetries via block copolymer nanomeshes [^8ad6128c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of block copolymers is a powerful motif for spontaneously forming well-defined nanostructures over macroscopic areas. Yet, the inherent energy minimization criteria of self-assembly give rise to a limited library of structures; diblock copolymers naturally form spheres on a cubic lattice, hexagonally packed cylinders and alternating lamellae. Here, we demonstrate multicomponent nanomeshes with any desired lattice symmetry. We exploit photothermal annealing to rapidly order and align block copolymer phases over macroscopic areas, combined with conversion of the self-assembled organic phase into inorganic replicas. Repeated photothermal processing independently aligns successive layers, providing full control of the size, symmetry and composition of the nanoscale unit cell. We construct a variety of symmetries, most of which are not natively formed by block copolymers, including squares, rhombuses, rectangles and triangles. In fact, we demonstrate all possible two-dimensional Bravais lattices. Finally, we elucidate the influence of nanostructure on the electrical and optical properties of nanomeshes.

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^1d03c06b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Multilayer block copolymer meshes by orthogonal self-assembly [^960cfe94]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Continued scaling-down of lithographic-pattern feature sizes has brought templated self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) into the forefront of nanofabrication research. Technologies now exist that facilitate significant control over otherwise unorganized assembly of BCP microdomains to form both long-range and locally complex monolayer patterns. In contrast, the extension of this control into multilayers or 3D structures of BCP microdomains remains limited, despite the possible technological applications in next-generation devices. Here, we develop and analyse an orthogonal self-assembly method in which multiple layers of distinct-molecular-weight BCPs naturally produce nanomesh structures of cylindrical microdomains without requiring layer-by-layer alignment or high-resolution lithographic templating. The mechanisms for orthogonal self-assembly are investigated with both experiment and simulation, and we determine that the control over height and chemical preference of templates are critical process parameters. The method is employed to produce nanomeshes with the shapes of circles and Y-intersections, and is extended to produce three layers of orthogonally oriented cylinders.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^dde23543]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Mouse thyroid high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) — technical parameters, anesthesia, and quantification — uses a Vevo 770 system with a single element probe of center frequency of 40 MHz; the transducer has an active face of 3 mm with lateral resolution 68.2 μm and axial resolution 38.5 μm, focal length 6 mm, mechanical index 0.14, and dynamic range 52 dB, with an alternative 30 MHz probe (focal depth 12.7 mm; lateral 115 μm; axial 55 μm). HFUS is performed under general anesthesia using 1.5%-2% isoflurane, real-time imaging can be performed at a frame rate of 20 Hz (temporal resolution 50 milliseconds), and studies can be completed in about 20 minutes. Thyroid lobe volume is calculated by the oval formula (width x depth x length x π/6); adult C57BL/6 thyroid volume ranges between 2.81 and 4.9 μL, increases to volumes that range between 4.1 and 8.8 μL with diffuse goiter, and the smallest detectable nodule diameter is 0.46 mm; features suggestive of malignancy include hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, internal microcalcification, irregular shapes, and extraglandular extension.

### The difficulties of representing continuous extent in infancy: using number is just easier [^203d1531]. Child Development (2008). Low credibility.

This study investigates the ability of 6-month-old infants to attend to the continuous properties of a set of discrete entities. Infants were habituated to dot arrays that were constant in cumulative surface area yet varied in number for small (< 4) or large (> 3) sets. Results revealed that infants detected a 4-fold (but not 3-fold) change in area, regardless of set size. These results are in marked contrast to demonstrations that infants of the same age successfully discriminate a 2- or 3-fold change in number, providing strong counterevidence to the claim that infants use solely nonnumerical, continuous extent variables when discriminating sets. These findings also shed light on the processes involved in tracking continuous variables in infants.

### One-size-fits-all strategy in carotid artery treatment using CGuard stent, feasibility and clinical pilot study [^7d4f9fbb]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

The study protocol was designed for using only CGuard carotid stent 10 mm diameter for all the reference diameters (class 1, 2, and 3) according to a strategy one-size-fits-all. In all cases, the 10-mm CGuard stent was implanted. The length distribution of the implanted stents was 76.9% with 10 mm × 40 mm and 23% with 10 mm × 30 mm. From the total study patient cohorts, 12.3% were pre-dilated and 100% were post-dilated with a 5.0 to 6.0 balloon at 10 ATM. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Procedural characteristics show no statistical differences among groups.

In order to compare the clinical outcomes of three patient cohorts, the reference diameters were segmented according to the CCA diameter in three groups: class 1 (6 ≤ x < 7 mm, namely [6–7) mm), class 2 (7 ≤ x < 8 mm, namely [7–8) mm), and class 3 (8 ≤ x < 9 mm, namely [8–9) mm).
