## Question

treatment for vasculitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a concise, guideline-aligned summary of treatment for vasculitis, with source citations integrated inline.

> Classification and severity framing come first because treatment hinges on vasculitis type and threat level, with small-vessel ANCA-associated vasculitis comprising GPA, MPA, and EGPA, and large-vessel vasculitis including GCA and TAK, and with active AAV generally considered potentially organ- or life-threatening until proven otherwise [^114CcdcV] [^116k6WLJ].

> General principles include multidisciplinary care in or linked to centers with vasculitis expertise, shared decision-making, structured disease activity monitoring, and a phased approach of remission induction followed by remission maintenance, with large-vessel vasculitis monitoring anchored in symptoms, examination, and ESR/CRP trends [^113LCMj7] [^112mDBpb] [^113jVRwj] [^114cef9b].

> Induction for GPA/MPA centers on rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids, with rituximab favored in relapsing disease, intravenous cyclophosphamide preferred over oral when selected, and steroid minimization guided by PEXIVAS-style tapering or avacopan-enabled regimens; intravenous methylprednisolone can be reserved for organ-threatening scenarios such as active renal involvement or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^112ywUx1] [^116tUvsp] [^112BnrrK] [^113pEcrZ].

> Avacopan is a validated steroid-sparing option during induction alongside rituximab or cyclophosphamide and supports more rapid glucocorticoid reduction or near-elimination in appropriate patients, reflecting evolving guidance to reduce cumulative steroid toxicity without compromising efficacy [^1123YLdW] [^112BnrrK].

> Adjunctive plasma exchange is not recommended routinely but may be considered for severe kidney involvement with creatinine above approximately 300 μmol/L after weighing risks and benefits, whereas trials and contemporary reviews caution against routine addition to standard induction for mortality or composite endpoints [^116k6WLJ] [^11167eog].

> Maintenance after induction is best achieved with rituximab at fixed 6‑month intervals for 24–48 months in most patients, given superiority to azathioprine in relapse prevention, with azathioprine or methotrexate as alternatives when rituximab is contraindicated or unavailable; glucocorticoids can often be withdrawn within 6–12 months depending on the regimen and disease control [^114CcdcV] [^112FuT3j] [^1163wwCd] [^113v9wtf].

> Duration of maintenance therapy typically spans 24–48 months for new-onset AAV, with consideration of extended therapy in high-relapse-risk subgroups, balanced against infection and immunosuppression risks, and with explicit patient communication when contemplating withdrawal about relapse signs and the need for prompt evaluation [^114CcdcV] [^112BnrrK] [^117Ghwoo].

> EGPA induction uses cyclophosphamide or rituximab for severe disease, while maintenance increasingly incorporates anti‑IL‑5 or IL‑5R therapy such as mepolizumab to aid remission durability and glucocorticoid tapering, with conventional agents or rituximab as alternatives where anti‑IL‑5 pathways are inaccessible [^116xtTYG] [^1175rwYJ].

> Clarification regarding combination therapy is important: combining rituximab with brief intravenous cyclophosphamide courses is a niche consideration chiefly for severe glomerulonephritis in AAV rather than a standard for non-severe EGPA, aligning with kidney-focused guidance that reserves such intensified approaches for advanced renal presentations [^117Kk2UA] [^111rFj5v].

> Large-vessel vasculitis management for GCA relies on high-dose oral glucocorticoids for new diagnoses without cranial ischemia, intravenous pulse steroids when vision is threatened, and tocilizumab to improve remission maintenance and reduce steroid exposure, while TAK care emphasizes regular symptom, examination, and inflammatory marker surveillance and shared decision-making [^112w6dCE] [^112Peyqv] [^1175rwYJ] [^1126AAXZ].

> Pediatric care follows adult-informed induction-to-maintenance paradigms with early transition at approximately 3–6 months, but evidence gaps necessitate individualized, multidisciplinary management, judicious steroid tapering, and engagement with emerging pediatric consensus frameworks such as SHARE, noting survey data that reflect practice variability and the need for pediatric-specific guidance [^114r9hST] [^115uEkrQ].

> Relapse management typically reuses rituximab for reinduction, especially if prior cyclophosphamide was used, and should prompt reassessment of maintenance duration; refractory disease requires verifying the diagnosis and excluding mimics or infection, then considering steroid escalation, intravenous pulses, rituximab–cyclophosphamide combination, avacopan, or plasma exchange in select contexts [^1171jDX3] [^111SfS3L].

> Monitoring should integrate clinical assessments, renal function and urinalysis, inflammatory markers, and judicious interpretation of ANCA trends without allowing serology alone to drive management decisions; relapse risk is higher with PR3‑ANCA, prior relapse, and incomplete remission, and preventive care should include vaccinations and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis during periods of high immunosuppression [^114CcdcV] [^112BnrrK].

> Emerging therapies and evolving paradigms emphasize complement pathway blockade with avacopan for steroid sparing in AAV, consolidation of anti‑IL‑5 strategies in EGPA, and expanded evidence supporting IL‑6 inhibition in GCA, all contributing to more targeted, toxicity-aware treatment pathways [^1123YLdW] [^1175rwYJ].

> In practice, an algorithmic approach begins with rapid severity triage and organ-threat assessment, selects rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus a steroid-minimizing plan for induction, reserves plasma exchange for advanced kidney injury after risk–benefit review, transitions to rituximab-based maintenance for 24–48 months with individualized duration, tapers and stops glucocorticoids when clinically feasible, and maintains vigilant surveillance for relapse and infection throughout care [^114CcdcV] [^112BnrrK] [^112ywUx1].

---

Treatment for vasculitis is individualized by type, severity, and organ involvement, following a remission-induction then maintenance strategy [^112mDBpb]. For ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), use rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids for induction [^112ywUx1]; rituximab is preferred in relapsing disease [^116tUvsp], and avacopan is a steroid-sparing option [^1123YLdW]. Maintenance typically uses rituximab or azathioprine for 18–48 months [^114CcdcV] [^112BnrrK], with methotrexate or mycophenolate as alternatives [^1163wwCd]. For giant cell arteritis, start high-dose glucocorticoids [^112w6dCE] and add tocilizumab to reduce relapse and steroid exposure [^1175rwYJ]; for Takayasu arteritis, use glucocorticoids with methotrexate or azathioprine and consider biologics for refractory disease [^1126AAXZ]. Plasma exchange is reserved for severe renal or pulmonary hemorrhage, and supportive care includes infection prophylaxis, osteoporosis prevention, and cardiovascular risk management.

## General principles of vasculitis treatment

Induce remission with initial aggressive immunosuppression [^112mDBpb], then maintain with prolonged therapy to prevent relapse [^11167eog]. Treatment is tailored to **vasculitis type, severity, organ involvement, and patient factors** [^112ywUx1] [^112MXH5h], and management in centers with vasculitis expertise and multidisciplinary care is recommended [^113LCMj7] [^1114A24b].

---

## Treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV)

### Induction therapy

- **Severe disease**: Rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids; rituximab preferred in relapsing disease [^112mDBpb] [^112ywUx1] [^116tUvsp].

- **Non-severe disease**: Methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil with glucocorticoids [^112mDBpb] [^112ywUx1].

- **Glucocorticoid regimens**: Reduced-dose regimens (e.g. PEXIVAS) lower infection risk without compromising efficacy [^112mDBpb] [^1123YLdW].

- **Avacopan**: A steroid-sparing option, particularly for patients at high risk of glucocorticoid toxicity [^112mDBpb] [^1123YLdW] [^11167eog].

---

### Maintenance therapy

- **Rituximab**: Preferred maintenance agent, superior to azathioprine in preventing relapse [^112mDBpb] [^112ywUx1] [^111SfS3L].

- **Azathioprine or methotrexate**: Alternatives when rituximab is contraindicated or unavailable [^112mDBpb] [^112ywUx1].

- **Duration**: Maintenance therapy typically continues for 18–48 months, individualized by relapse risk [^114CcdcV] [^112BnrrK].

---

## Treatment of large vessel vasculitis (LVV)

### Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

**Glucocorticoids** are first-line at high doses [^112w6dCE] [^113qQ1Mu], with tapering based on response and patient preference. **Tocilizumab** reduces relapse and glucocorticoid exposure and is recommended for maintenance [^112w6dCE] [^114cef9b] [^1175rwYJ].

---

### Takayasu arteritis (TAK)

Glucocorticoids are **first-line therapy**, with tapering based on response [^113qQ1Mu]. Methotrexate or azathioprine is used with glucocorticoids for refractory or relapsing disease, and biologics such as tocilizumab or TNF inhibitors are considered when disease remains refractory [^113qQ1Mu] [^1126AAXZ].

---

## Treatment of medium vessel vasculitis

### Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)

Glucocorticoids are **first-line therapy**; add cyclophosphamide for severe or life-threatening disease, and use antiviral therapy for hepatitis B-associated PAN [^1114A24b] [^116Ux7KT].

---

## Treatment of small vessel vasculitis

### IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura)

Supportive care, including analgesics and hydration, is appropriate for mild disease, while **glucocorticoids** are used for severe renal or gastrointestinal involvement [^115uEkrQ] [^112mKDUP].

---

### Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis

Antiviral therapy is indicated for hepatitis C-associated disease, and **rituximab** is used for severe or refractory cases [^1175rwYJ] [^116Ux7KT].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

- **Plasma exchange**: For severe renal involvement or pulmonary hemorrhage in AAV.

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis during immunosuppression [^112ywUx1].

- **Osteoporosis prevention**: Calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates as indicated [^112mDBpb].

- **Cardiovascular risk management**: Control hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes [^112mDBpb].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring [^114cef9b] involves clinical assessment, laboratory tests (ESR, CRP, ANCA), and imaging as indicated [^113jVRwj]. Patient education should teach patients to **recognize relapse signs** and seek prompt care [^111Bk5ge].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Complement inhibition with **avacopan** shows promise as a steroid-sparing approach [^112mDBpb] [^1123YLdW] [^11167eog]; IL-5 inhibition with mepolizumab is used for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^116xtTYG] [^1175rwYJ]; and personalized medicine aims to tailor therapy based on biomarkers and disease phenotype [^112MXH5h] [^112mDBpb].

---

In summary, **therapy is individualized** by vasculitis type, severity, and organ involvement, using an induction-then-maintenance approach with vigilant monitoring and supportive care [^112mDBpb] [^112BnrrK].

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^1165QQH3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are characterized by small-vessel necrotizing inflammation and, prior to the advent of immunosuppressive therapy, frequently had a fatal outcome. Treatment has transformed AAV into a relapsing/remitting disease, albeit with increased drug-related toxicities and organ damage. The use of glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppressives — including azathioprine, mycophenolate, and methotrexate — was optimized through a sequence of clinical trials, establishing a standard of care against which subsequent targeted therapies could be developed.

Improved understanding of pathophysiology has supported the development of B-cell depletion and complement inhibition in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, as well as interleukin 5 inhibition for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, leading to the approval of newer agents for these conditions. There has been increased attention on minimizing the adverse effects of treatment and on understanding the epidemiology of comorbidities in AAV. This review will focus on recent evidence from clinical trials, especially with respect to glucocorticoids, avacopan, plasma exchange, rituximab, and mepolizumab, and their interpretation in the 2022 management recommendations by the European League of Associations of Rheumatology.

### CanVasc consensus recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis: 2020 update [^111pxr3m]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, specifically with respect to the maintenance of remission, the CanVasc 2021 guidelines recommend initiating low-dose corticosteroids as part of the initial remission maintenance therapy after remission is achieved in patients with GPA. There is insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal duration for low-dose corticosteroids for remission maintenance.

---

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^111W3nFq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Historically, untreated anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) had a 1-year mortality rate of 80%. The introduction of glucocorticoids prolonged survival but required the combination with cyclophosphamide to achieve stable remission. The toxicity of prolonged cyclophosphamide use encouraged the adoption of safer oral immunosuppressives and limiting cyclophosphamide use to an induction period of 3–6 months. Although cyclophosphamide was established as the routine immunosuppressive for induction, alternative immunosuppressives such as methotrexate and mycophenolate were tested but with limited success. Rituximab, introduced in the early 2000s, was the first effective alternative to cyclophosphamide. It is favored for relapsing disease and is increasingly selected as a first-line induction agent, with its use now extended to the long-term prevention of relapse.

AAV is heterogeneous at presentation with respect to organ involvement and severity. This has led to attempts to subgroup patients based on clinical presentation to tailor the choice of treatment. No system of subgrouping has become widely accepted, and this remains a confusing area with terminology such as severe/non-severe, major/minor, and organ-threatening/non-organ-threatening used without robust definitions. The goals of treatment are to achieve remission, as delayed remission or failure to achieve remission is associated with higher mortality and damage, including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) risks. Once remission is achieved, the next goal is to prevent relapse, with over 50% of AAV patients at risk.

### Systemic vasculitis: Still a challenging disease [^116LTey6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of therapeutic regimens in patients with systemic vasculitis is high, albeit with considerable treatment toxicity. Optimal therapy for these potentially life-threatening diseases remains a topic of debate. An improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of systemic vasculitis has spurred the development of new therapeutic alternatives. These alternatives offer better potential specificity for targeting both the inflammation and immunologic causes of vasculitis, including new immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate, monoclonal antibody modulators of lymphocyte function like rituximab, and cytokine-directed therapies such as infliximab and etanercept.

The safety and efficacy of these agents are increasingly being investigated for use in systemic vasculitis. Additionally, many randomized prospective clinical trials have been completed to determine the precise roles of more conventional treatments like cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and plasma exchange. This research is providing an expanding evidence base to guide therapy in these challenging diseases.

There is now clear evidence that the duration of cyclophosphamide therapy can be relatively short (3 months), while long-term maintenance therapy is necessary to avoid relapse, often using azathioprine. Patients at a relatively greater risk for relapse can be identified. We review the most recent data on the management of systemic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, focusing on strategies to improve long-term outcomes, reduce treatment toxicity, and minimize the risk of relapse.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^114r9hST]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

All respondents followed a remission-induction and remission-maintenance model, switching from induction to maintenance therapy within 3–6 months. In adult studies, the choice of induction agent may be adjusted based on measures of disease severity, primarily to limit the use of aggressive, life-saving treatment — specifically cyclophosphamide — that also has significant toxicity and may be unwarranted in milder disease. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents endorsed always using more aggressive treatment for patients with severe disease, while 32% reported only sometimes choosing induction therapy based on disease severity.

- **Induction and maintenance therapies**: Table 5 shows first-line induction and maintenance therapies preferred by respondents for the treatment of AAV. Respondents were not asked to distinguish between GPA- and MPA-specific regimens. In patients with severe disease not requiring intensive care, cyclophosphamide (CYC) was the first choice of remission-induction agent by 66% of respondents, while 31% stated they would choose rituximab (RTX). Use of RTX rather than CYC as an induction agent was more frequently reported by respondents from the United States (OR = 2.7 [1.3, 5.5], p = 0.0190, n = 139), those with greater than 5 years of experience (OR = 3.8 [1.3, 12.5], p = 0.0279, n = 137), and those who had seen more than 10 patients with GPA/MPA in their careers (OR = 4.39 [2.1, 9.1], p = 0.0011, n = 133).

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113P4Gra]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid treatment in those not considered for avacopan use:

- **In patients with organ- or life-threatening disease**: We advocate treatment with oral glucocorticoids (GC) at a starting dose of 50–75 mg or 1.0 mg/kg/day (dependent on weight with a maximum of 75 mg daily). Oral GC (prednisolone) should be tapered in accordance with the PEXIVAS tapering schedule, achieving a dose of 5 mg prednisolone equivalent per day by 4–5 months (GRADE 1B, SoA 96%).

- **In patients with non-organ- or non-life-threatening disease**: Lower GC-tapering regimens can be considered, at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day oral GC (prednisolone), with tapering in accordance with the LoVAS regimen (GRADE 1B, SoA 97%).

- **Paediatric considerations**: Whilst paediatric patients were not included in PEXIVAS, this tapering regimen can be considered for adolescents. For younger children, the SHARE guidelines for prednisolone tapering could also be considered (GRADE 2C, SoA 96%).

- **Use of intravenous methylprednisolone (IV MP) pulses**: Despite commonplace use, there is a lack of supporting trial evidence for IV MP pulses. Therefore, IV MP pulses are not routinely recommended but can be reserved as an option for the management of organ-threatening manifestations, including active renal disease and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (GRADE 2C, SoA 97%).

Use of complement inhibitor avacopan:

Patients with active GPA or MPA should be considered for avacopan use as a steroid-sparing agent, with or without a short course of GC (tapering over four weeks) (GRADE 1A, SoA 96%).

Maintenance of remission treatment:

Following induction of remission with a rituximab (RTX) or cyclophosphamide (CYC)-based treatment.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^114c165e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple national and international rheumatology organizations have published treatment guidelines for the management of AAV in adults. Many require formal clinical measurement tools to assess disease "severity" (to stratify appropriate therapy) and "activity" (to determine when to start, stop, or modify therapy). These standardized measures also guide the entry of adult patients into research studies and will inevitably guide research eligibility in children. However, one-third of respondents reported only sometimes tailoring induction therapy to a formalized disease severity scale, suggesting that other factors — likely including informal assessment, histopathology, and specific organ involvement — influence management decisions. In children, PVAS may show better correlation with treatment decisions than the BVAS v.3; nevertheless, equal proportions of respondents used BVAS or its variants. Furthermore, evaluation of permanent damage from disease or treatment is required for outcome assessment and may allow prediction of mortality. The PVDI is a relatively recent pediatric modification of the adult VDI yet to be validated; however, few respondents used either tool. Lack of knowledge or familiarity — as well as perceived lack of utility — may account for some lack of uptake. Successful implementation of practice guidelines requiring standardized assessment tools will depend on improved clinician engagement, clear clinical utility, and feasibility of use.

Consistent with guidelines for the treatment of adults with AAV, all survey responde

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1123YLdW]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

In 2021, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases was published. KDIGO is committed to providing the nephrology community with periodic updates based on new developments for each disease. For patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), avacopan received regulatory approval in late 2021, leading to this KDIGO guideline update. In addition, the evidence supporting a lower-dose glucocorticoid induction regimen or even complete replacement of glucocorticoids has become stronger. Herein, an executive summary of the most important guideline changes from the AAV chapter is provided as a quick reference.

### Therapeutic advances in the treatment of vasculitis [^114yLaaF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The CYCAZAREM trial (CYClophosphamide or AZAthioprine for REMission) recruited 144 new adult patients with AAV and compared a 3–6-month cyclophosphamide course, stopping when remission was achieved, to a standard 12-month course of cyclophosphamide. Both groups were then switched to azathioprine as maintenance therapy, and no differences in remission or relapse rates were observed. The validation of sequential cyclophosphamide induction followed by azathioprine maintenance has subsequently served as the basis for later trials.

Pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYCLOPS, CYCLophosphamide Oral versus PulSed) was then shown to be as effective as daily oral cyclophosphamide, with a 50% reduction in cumulative cyclophosphamide dose and fewer adverse events. Based on these studies, induction of remission therapy in adults and children with AAV includes corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (usually 6–10 intravenous doses at 500–1000 mg/m² [maximum 1.2 g] per dose, given every 3–4 weeks). Intravenous pulsed cyclophosphamide is increasingly favored over oral continuous cyclophosphamide in adults and children due to the reduced cumulative dose and less neutropenic sepsis in adult patients, albeit without strong prospective pediatric evidence.

In addition, B-cell depletion with rituximab has been explored as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for remission induction for AAV. The efficacy of this treatment approach for severe renal disease, in combination with two intravenous cyclophosphamide doses, was evaluated in the RITUXVAS trial. This regimen had no benefit over a standard intravenous cyclophosphamide course.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113pEcrZ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

These recommendations were commissioned by the BSR Guidelines Steering Group (GSG). A working group (WG) was created involving relevant stakeholders. Recommendations in this report were developed, where appropriate, using the BSR Creating Clinical Guidelines Protocol, which employs the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) methodology. The guideline protocol was not fully adhered to, as the scope of the work was not published prior to the final literature review. This was due to no significant new evidence having been highlighted since the publication of the ACR 2021, KDIGO 2021, and the updates from 2024, EULAR 2022, and EESG 2024 guidelines. The intention was to provide a timely update of the BSR guideline 2014, relevant to the UK clinical context. Hence, the document is described as 'Management Recommendations' rather than a 'Guideline'. Development was overseen by the BSR Guideline Steering Group throughout.

Following a virtual meeting of the full Working Group (WG), the scope of the project was agreed upon and grouped into domains. Small working groups for each domain were formed to develop initial recommendations for discussion by the full WG. These initial recommendations were then adapted over a series of virtual meetings involving the entire WG. Each suggested recommendation in the final document was evaluated by all members and subjected to a vote relating to the strength of agreement on a scale of 1 (no agreement) to 100% (complete agreement).

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^1136XvBw]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

A majority of respondents (53%) reported using a combination of resources to guide treatment decisions, most commonly EULAR/EUVAS recommendations (24%). A minority used site-specific standardized protocols (7%); others used pediatric textbook recommendations (4%), individualized approaches based on personal interpretation (4%), or advice from colleagues (6%).

The majority of respondents (96%) believed in a need for pediatric treatment guidelines for GPA/MPA. Over half (58%) were interested in being involved in the process of consensus guideline development — 43% through an iterative survey — while others felt they did not have the time (13%) or relevant expertise (19%), or were unsure (9%).

There was no association between group membership and the desire to participate in guideline development (OR = 1.4 [0.4, 5.1], p = 0.7206, n = 131), although respondents practicing outside the United States and Canada were more likely to want to participate than those within (OR = 4.2 [1.9, 9.0], p = 0.0011, n = 135).

Most respondents supported consensus guidelines drafted by an expert group (69%) and believed in the need for a limited range of options to allow for comparative outcome assessment through a clinical registry (63%). Slightly less than half (46%) felt modification of recommendations for adult disease was an acceptable method for generating pediatric treatment guidelines.

Regarding medical management for microscopic polyangiitis, specifically concerning induction of remission when the condition is non-severe, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend preferring cyclophosphamide for induction therapy in the following cases:

- **Rituximab difficult to access**:
	- Cyclophosphamide should be used in this scenario.

- **Severe glomerulonephritis (serum creatinine > 4 mg/dL; 354 µmol/L)**:
	- Consider administering a combination of two intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide with rituximab.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the blood vessel wall. These conditions can manifest as either systemic or localized processes and may affect large, medium, or small vessels depending on the specific disorder. Vascular physicians, including interventional radiologists, often become involved early in the diagnostic process, as patients may present with symptoms indicative of occlusive vascular syndromes.

In this article, we explore the signs and symptoms of vasculitis, as well as the laboratory and imaging studies necessary for accurate evaluation. Treatment options, including both interventional and non-interventional strategies, are also discussed.

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^111SfS3L]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

The failure of a patient to respond to induction therapy or to achieve complete remission defines refractory disease. Alternative diagnoses or the presence of vasculitis secondary to another disease process (such as malignancy, infection, or drugs like cocaine) need to be considered. Instability in the control of disease activity early in the treatment course is not infrequent and is managed by an increase in oral glucocorticoids or the use of intravenous glucocorticoids. Other options include combining cyclophosphamide and rituximab, introducing avacopan, or considering PLEX. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins have also been used, especially in the context of concurrent infection.

The first choice for maintenance of remission treatment after induction with rituximab or cyclophosphamide has changed to rituximab from azathioprine or methotrexate, following the results of the Rituximab versus Azathioprine for Maintenance in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (MAINRITSAN) and RITAZAREM trials. These trials studied different patient populations and different rituximab doses. A dose of 500 mg every six months for two to four years is now recommended, although some patients may require a higher or more frequent dose. Extending the remission treatment period from two to four years has been supported by data from azathioprine and prednisolone in the Randomised Controlled Trial of Prolonged Treatment in the Remission Phase of ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (REMAIN) trial and from prolonged rituximab use in the Long-Term Rituximab Use to Maintain Remission of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis (MAINRITSAN III) trial.

### The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114jwcZt]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Recommendations in this report were developed based on the BSR Creating Clinical Guidelines Protocol v5.4 (2023) using AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) methodology. Following a virtual meeting of the full working group (WG), the scope of the project was agreed upon and grouped into domains. Small working groups for each domain were formed and developed initial recommendations for discussion by the full WG. These initial recommendations were then adapted over a series of virtual meetings of the full WG.

The guideline protocol was not followed fully, as the scope of the work was not published prior to the final literature review. This was due to the fact that, at the time this work was commenced, no significant new evidence had been highlighted since the publication of the ACR 2021, KDIGO 2021 and update 2024, EULAR 2022, and EESG 2024 guidelines. The intention was to provide a timely update of the BSR guideline 2014 relevant to the UK clinical context. It is for this reason that this manuscript is described as 'Management Recommendations' rather than a 'Guideline'. Development was overseen by the BSR Guideline Steering Group throughout. Subgroups developed the initial recommendations, which were then adapted over a series of virtual meetings of the full WG. The final draft of the guidance was submitted to the BSR Guidelines Steering Group for stakeholder and internal review and feedback.

The quality of evidence was graded according to the GRADE approach. Evidence was graded as strong.

### Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^112nD7RJ]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Considerable variability exists in the way health-care providers treat patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis in Latin America. The most frequently used treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis are cyclophosphamide and prolonged glucocorticoid tapers. However, randomized controlled trials conducted over the past 30 years have led to the development of several evidence-based treatment alternatives for these patients. Latin America faces socioeconomic challenges that affect access to care, and the use of certain costly medications with proven efficacy for ANCA-associated vasculitis is often restricted.

For these reasons, the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology developed the first ANCA-associated vasculitis treatment guidelines tailored for Latin America. A panel of local vasculitis experts generated clinically meaningful questions related to the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format. Following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology, a team of methodologists conducted a systematic literature review. The panel of vasculitis experts voted on each PICO question and made recommendations, which required at least 70% agreement among the voting members.

- **Recommendations and expert opinion statements**: 21 recommendations and two expert opinion statements for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis were developed, considering the evidence and the socioeconomic characteristics of the region. These recommendations include guidance for the use of glucocorticoids and other treatments.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116k6WLJ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Key recommendations:

- **Domain 1: Gpa and mpa treatment**: All people with lived experience of active (newly diagnosed or relapsed) ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) should be considered as having potentially life- or organ-threatening disease (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%).

- **Use of immunosuppressants for GPA and MPA**:
	- All people with lived experience of active GPA or MPA should be assessed for induction of remission treatment with immunosuppressants combined with glucocorticoids (GC) or avacopan (GRADE 1A, SoA 99%).
	- The recommended options for immunosuppression for remission induction of newly diagnosed GPA or MPA are intravenous pulsed cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) (GRADE 1A, SoA 98%).
	- For active relapsing disease, treatment with RTX is preferred (GRADE 1B, SoA 97%).
	- A combination of both CYC and RTX can be considered for organ-threatening or life-threatening disease (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%).
	- Certain patients with active GPA or MPA, with no evidence of life- or organ-threatening disease, may be considered for alternative induction therapy with methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (GRADE 1A, SoA 96%).

- **Use of plasmapheresis**:
	- Active GPA or MPA and severe kidney involvement with creatinine > 300 μmol/l should be considered for adjunctive plasmapheresis provided their risk of potential adverse events has been considered (GRADE 2B, SoA 96%).
	- For children living with active GPA or MPA, there is insufficient data to routinely recommend plasmapheresis for severe renal involvement; therefore, this should only be considered on a case-by-case basis after discussion with an expert.

### European League Against Rheumatism/European Vasculitis Study Group recommendations for the management of vasculitis [^1114A24b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

To discuss the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations in the management of primary systemic vasculitis, important developments in the classification and treatment of systemic vasculitis have led to the publication of recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of small, medium, and large-vessel vasculitides. These recommendations resulted from a combination of evidence from systematic analysis of selected studies and the experience of experts in vasculitis when data were not available.

The purpose of formulating clinical recommendations is to improve quality of care and guide the clinician inexperienced with vasculitis. Nevertheless, patients with vasculitis should be managed by a vasculitis expert whenever possible. As our understanding of this rare and complex group of diseases advances, novel therapeutic options are being developed.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^113aomHo]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The proportions of respondents using formal tools to assess disease severity, activity, and damage are detailed as follows: While most respondents used formal assessment tools for severity (59%) and activity (63%), only 36% had ever formally assessed disease damage. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), the Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS), and BVAS for Wegener's Granulomatosis were frequently used to stage disease severity. However, tools such as the Five Factor Score and the EUVAS and WGET severity scores were used by a minority.

- **Disease activity assessment**: PVAS, BVAS, and physician's global assessment on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (PGA) were the primary tools used by respondents for scoring disease activity. This assessment typically occurred at the time of diagnosis (39% used it at only some follow-up visits, 33% at all visits, 16% at prescribed times according to research protocols, and 7% at the time of diagnosis only). Most respondents felt formal assessment of disease activity was somewhat important to clinical management (mode 3, median 5, IQR 3–4), and more important to research (mode 5, median 5, IQR 4–5).

- **Disease damage assessment**: The most commonly used tools for scoring disease damage include the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) or its pediatric adaptation, PVDI. Similar to the scoring of disease activity, respondents assessed disease damage primarily at the time of diagnosis (35% at only some follow-up visits, 23% at prescribed times only, and 31% at every visit).

Respondent rationales for not using formal assessment tools are shown in Table 4.

**Maintenance of remission for EGPA**: Anti-IL-5/IL-5R directed therapies are recommended for maintenance of remission and to aid in tapering of GC, given their availability for any licensed indications (GRADE 1A, SoA 99%). RTX, MTX, MMF, or AZA may be considered as alternative options when anti-IL-5/IL-5R therapies are unavailable, or as adjunctive maintenance therapies depending on disease phenotype (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%). GC should be tapered to the lowest possible effective dose while maintaining disease remission, taking into consideration patient-specific disease manifestations, comorbidities, and preferences (GRADE 1A, SoA 99%).

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^117XxESs]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Taken together, these data suggest a need for and interest in consensus treatment guidelines for pediatric GPA and MPA. They also point to potential challenges associated with guideline development and implementation. Understanding the barriers to uptake of existing classification criteria and formal assessment tools will inform efforts to improve standardization of classification and assessment to guide therapy. Physicians' aspirations for pediatric-specific, evidence-based treatments may motivate uptake of guidelines that evolve from this needs assessment survey and, imminently, from SHARE. Consensus-derived guidelines that include a range of specific treatment options — if provided together with mechanisms for comparative effectiveness research through an international registry — may facilitate clinician engagement and ultimately lead to improved outcomes for children with AAV.

### Update on vasculitis [^116XEJuq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a broad group of diseases identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. These unique entities have a broad spectrum of organ involvement and severity, which influences the approach to diagnosis and treatment. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents are used to manage most vasculitic diseases. Long-term outcomes are influenced by chronic sequelae from organ damage, disease relapses, and medication side effects. Further research is needed to understand these diseases and discover more efficacious yet less toxic therapeutic options. This review will focus on vasculitic syndromes more likely to be presented to an allergist/immunologist in an outpatient setting.

### An approach to the diagnosis and management of systemic vasculitis [^116Ux7KT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The systemic vasculitides are a complex and often serious group of disorders which, while uncommon, require careful management to ensure optimal outcomes. In most cases, there is no known cause. Multi-system disease is likely to be fatal without the judicious use of immunosuppression. Prompt diagnosis is necessary to preserve organ function. Comprehensive and repeated disease assessment forms the basis for planning therapy and modifying treatment protocols according to response.

Therapies typically include glucocorticoids and, especially for small and medium vessel vasculitis, an effective immunosuppressive agent. Cyclophosphamide is currently the standard therapy for small vessel multi-system vasculitis, but other agents are now being evaluated in large randomized trials. Comorbidity is common in patients with vasculitis, including the cumulative effects of potentially toxic therapy. Long-term evaluation of patients is important to detect and manage relapses.

### Therapeutic advances in the treatment of vasculitis [^115uEkrQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Primary systemic vasculitides of the young are relatively rare diseases but are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is a diagnostic delay. There have been a number of notable advances recently in the field of pediatric vasculitis research, including the development of classification criteria and tools to assess disease outcome for use in clinical trials and other research involving children with vasculitis. Treatment regimens continue to improve with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents.

With the exception of Kawasaki Disease, most treatment approaches for pediatric vasculitides are based on evidence from small case series, anecdotal observations, or adult studies. Therefore, treatment differs substantially throughout Europe, and even within a single country, experience and practices vary considerably. Given that vasculitides are rare, conducting large randomized controlled trials using traditional clinical trial design is usually not feasible. There is, however, a need for a standardized approach to the management of these rare pediatric rheumatic diseases. The SHARE (Single-Hub Access for Pediatric Rheumatology in Europe) project has been set up to address this unmet need, and one of the main aims is to provide recommendations for the management of pediatric rheumatological diseases in European countries. Within this context, the SHARE vasculitis working group has recently provided consensus and (where possible) evidence-based statements.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^116DSZ29]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

All respondents felt that an international collaborative registry was important for comparative outcome assessment of treatment strategies for GPA/MPA, with 64% of respondents selecting "very important" (mode 5, median 5, IQR 4–5). Primary motivations for participation in clinical studies or collaborative registries included the potential to improve outcomes for children with AAV (91%), access to available tools and resources (58%), endorsement by a formal network of investigators (49%), potential publication authorship (46%), and association with specific research objectives (40%). Only 15% of respondents felt that a monetary stipend was a major motivation.

Registry-associated resources believed to be of most value included an automated PVAS calculator (82%), an online algorithm to stage disease severity with links to corresponding treatment guidelines (68%), an automated PVDI calculator (66%), a classification tool based on entered patient data (54%), and a printable table to track patient data over multiple visits (54%). Most clinicians had resources available to assist with the use of registry data entry and clinical tools, including computer and internet access in the clinic (80% each) and a trainee or fellow (58%). Fewer had a research assistant (47%), support for review board applications (37%), technology support (33%), or a research nurse (23%).

Major barriers to registry participation included insufficient support for data entry (59%), lack of time (43%), burden of ethics review board approval (32%), and lack of patients (24%).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microscopic polyangiitis, especially in the management of relapse, the CanVasc 2021 guidelines recommend the initiation of either cyclophosphamide or rituximab in conjunction with corticosteroids for induction of remission in patients experiencing a major organ- or life-threatening relapse. Rituximab should be initiated for reinduction of remission in patients previously treated with cyclophosphamide during the initial induction of remission or previous disease relapse.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^117Co228]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) describes the subset of vasculitides primarily involving small vessels, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome), and renal-limited pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Although rare in childhood, AAV carries a high burden of morbidity. With the use of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, AAV is no longer rapidly fatal in the majority of affected children; however, these treatments have significant adverse effects. Balancing the risks associated with existing therapies against the damage associated with under- or over-treatment remains a challenge. In adult populations, this balance has been incrementally fine-tuned through clinical trials that rely on accurate disease sub-classification and scoring tools to stage disease severity, activity, and damage.

- **Clinical practice variation**: The rarity of pediatric AAV has limited opportunities for pediatric clinical trials, such that management decisions are largely informed by adult data, with potential for significant practice variation. A 2005 survey of Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) members elicited overwhelming consensus on the need to study childhood-onset vasculitis independently from adult disease. ARChiVe (A Registry for Childhood Vasculitis) was established in 2007 based on this imperative for pediatric research.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114CeJ6y]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) comprises heterogeneous, multisystem disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small and medium-sized blood vessels with unknown etiology. Three distinct clinico-pathological syndromes have been identified: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), which are associated with autoantibodies directed against neutrophil granular proteins, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase. These conditions are uncommon, with incidence and prevalence rates of approximately 25 per million population and 200 per million, respectively. Despite significant advances in treatment, mortality rates remain elevated, at 2.3 times that of the general population. Early diagnosis, swift institution of appropriate immunosuppression, and limiting toxicity from treatment are key to mitigating mortality and damage from AAV.

### Diagnosis and/or classification of vasculitis: different [^112KHakZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the absence of diagnostic criteria for vasculitides. There is an initiative by the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology to formulate separate classification and diagnostic criteria for different forms of vasculitis. Previously, the authors of this review disagreed with separating classification and diagnostic criteria, and they expand this disagreement with more recent information and a reassessment of older communications.

Recent findings reveal that no clear methodologies have been proposed for preparing separate diagnostic and classification criteria. The lack of emphasis on probabilities in disease criteria discussions is notably apparent. Among 77 articles on diagnostic/classification criteria, only 4% addressed Bayes' theorem, predictive values, or confidence intervals. Misconceptions about circularity concerns and the role of nomenclature in classification and diagnostic criteria persist.

The summary concludes that separate diagnostic and classification criteria are unrealistic. Classification criteria and nomenclature serve merely as tools for proper diagnosis and do not differ fundamentally in patient care or research. A candid discussion about probabilities in diagnosis is crucial, not only with patients but also with all stakeholders involved.

### Diagnosing and treating ANCA-associated vasculitis: An updated review for clinical practice [^11167eog]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a group of rare, primary, systemic necrotizing small-vessel vasculitides. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis account for approximately 80–90% of all AAV cases. Exposure to silica dust, farming, and chronic nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage are associated with an increased risk of developing AAV.

When a diagnosis of AAV is suspected, as in patients with multisystem organ dysfunction or features such as chronic rhinosinusitis, cavitated lung nodules, palpable purpura, or acute kidney injury, appropriate further investigations are needed, including ANCA testing. In this scenario, a structured clinical assessment should be conducted, evaluating all the organs possibly involved, and tissue biopsy may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis.

- **Therapeutic algorithms**: Vary based on the severity of AAV, the clinical diagnosis/ANCA specificity, and the patient's age, weight, comorbidities, and prognosis. Recent data favor rituximab as a preferable option for both induction and maintenance of remission. Additionally, regimens with fewer glucocorticoids are equally effective and safer in inducing remission compared with conventional regimens, and avacopan is an effective glucocorticoid-sparing option.

In contrast, there is no compelling evidence to support the routine use of plasma exchange in addition to standard remission-induction therapy in AAV. ANCA and other biomarkers can be helpful in association with clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions. Patients should be frequently evaluated.

### ANCA vasculitis: Time for a change in treatment paradigm? Not yet [^116TrorV]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are conventionally treated with a strategy of remission induction followed by maintenance therapy using glucocorticoids combined with CYC during induction and AZA for maintenance. Recently, several randomized controlled trials have been published that question whether these drugs should remain those of choice.

- **B-cell depletion using rituximab**: Rituximab is at least as effective as CYC for remission induction in newly presenting patients, but long-term efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness data are awaited. Thus, rituximab should be reserved for patients at high risk of infertility. Rituximab seems to be effective at inducing remission in relapsing patients. Whether routine pre-emptive treatment with rituximab for remission maintenance is a better approach than waiting for relapse is unknown.

- **Comparison of other medications**: MTX and LEF have similar efficacy to AZA, but are not significantly safer, while MMF is less effective. Thus, AZA remains the conventional maintenance drug of choice.

The era prior to 1990 was a period of careful observation of disease presentation, course, outcomes, and meticulous pathology studies. These mainly single-centre studies introduced new life-saving therapies for drugs that are still used effectively today. During the 1970s and 1980s, cyclophosphamide (CyP) combined with glucocorticosteroids (GCS) was shown to be life-saving. The trade-off for this was often severe adverse events. Some forms of vasculitis were found not to be as ominous as initially thought, and some could be treated with safer drugs, such as methotrexate (MTX). However, whether mild or severe, patients were not cured.

From 1990 to the present, large collaborative networks have conducted studies that were not possible before. Randomized controlled trials captured and manipulated vast amounts of data, banked biological specimens, and shared these resources and intellectual capital, moving the field forward at an extraordinary pace. We now understand that even for severe forms of granulomatosis and polyangiitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Wegener's granulomatosus (WG)], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), extended use of CyP is unnecessary. It has been recently learned that rituximab is as effective as CyP for severe WG and MPA. We should never again see the permanent toxicities caused by years of chronic CyP use. However, short courses of CyP remain useful and can be life-saving. Step-down therapy from CyP is now a standard of care and might be replaced by rituximab in the future. If one accepts the premise that there are currently few cures for idiopathic large-vessel vasculitis, then further research and innovation remain crucial.

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^111aKZ5w]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

In a nutshell: Induction treatment of life/organ-threatening anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis involves a combination of glucocorticoids and rituximab or cyclophosphamide, with rituximab preferred in relapsing granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis. A rapidly reducing glucocorticoid regimen is now favored, following the Plasma Exchange and Glucocorticoids in Severe ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (PEXIVAS) Trial schedule, which reduces the risk of serious infection without loss of efficacy. Although plasma exchange did not improve the combined endpoint of death and/or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), a meta-analysis concluded that plasma exchange results in a reduced risk of ESKD at 12 months and should be considered in patients presenting with a serum creatinine greater than 300 μmol/L.

For maintenance of remission treatment, fixed-interval, repeat-dose rituximab for 24–48 months is more effective than azathioprine or methotrexate and allows glucocorticoid discontinuation within 6 months of the start of therapy. Relapse risk increases after rituximab withdrawal. Understanding the risks and consequences of relapse, as well as the risks of secondary immunodeficiency with rituximab, informs the physician's decision on treatment duration. New insights into the role of the complement alternative pathway in pathogenesis led to the development of the oral anti-C5a receptor, avacopan. Avacopan was superior over 1 year compared to a standard glucocorticoid tapering regimen when administered in combination with rituximab or cyclophosphamide, notably leading to a more rapid reduction in p.

### Management of primary vasculitides with biologic and novel small molecule medications [^1175rwYJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Vasculitides can affect small, medium, and/or large vessels, leading to end-organ damage, decreased quality of life, and death. Glucocorticoids remain the backbone of treatment for systemic vasculitis but are associated with numerous toxicities. In recent years, the efficacy of glucocorticoid-sparing biologic and novel small molecule therapies has been demonstrated.

- **Recent findings**: In giant cell arteritis, tocilizumab was superior to glucocorticoid monotherapy in maintenance remission and cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, and is now approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis. In addition to the previously demonstrated efficacy of rituximab for remission induction in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, recent trials have also demonstrated its superiority for remission maintenance compared to alternative approaches. Mepolizumab is superior to standard of care alone with regard to remission rates and glucocorticoid-sparing effect in refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Avacopan has shown significant promise in ANCA-associated vasculitis as part of a glucocorticoid-free induction regimen in a recently completed phase 3 trial. Use of biologics in rarer vasculitides remains guided by reports from small case series.

Biologics and other novel therapies have an increasingly important role in the management of systemic vasculitis. Additional studies are needed to define their optimal use and to guide their use in more rare forms of vasculitis.

### Vasculitis [^112mKDUP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, which can be broadly grouped as secondary vasculitides, occurring in association with an underlying disease or trigger, or primary vasculitides, where vasculitis occurs for as-yet unknown causes. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a range of disease entities uniquely identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics.

Individual diseases predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, influencing their clinical manifestations and useful in their classification. The vasculitides can differ in severity, ranging from self-limited illnesses to those that can be life-threatening without prompt treatment. Immunosuppressive agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although these treatments can be effective, the patient's long-term course may be affected by organ damage from the initial presentation, disease relapses, and medication toxicity. Recent investigations have focused on understanding disease pathophysiology and exploring novel therapeutic approaches.

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^113FKFzm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment in GPA/MPA: Induction therapy for GPA/MPA involves glucocorticoids and either rituximab or cyclophosphamide. Variance from this approach can be considered in particular patient scenarios. Rituximab is preferred for relapsing disease based on data from the Rituximab versus Cyclophosphamide for ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) and rituximab versus azathioprine for maintenance of remission in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and relapsing disease (RITAZAREM) trials.

The combination of rituximab with low-dose cyclophosphamide was as effective as full-dose cyclophosphamide in the Rituximab versus Cyclophosphamide in ANCA-Associated Renal Vasculitis (RITUXVAS) Trial. This approach has been effective and steroid-sparing in observational studies, especially for patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, but has not been formally compared with rituximab without cyclophosphamide and carries a higher risk of immune suppression. In practice, if rituximab or cyclophosphamide is selected at the beginning of induction treatment and there is not an optimal response, the other can be added. Intravenous cyclophosphamide is preferred to oral cyclophosphamide due to reduced total drug exposure and significantly reduced risks of bladder toxicity.

### Can we cure vasculitis [^116HaSFk]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

As with all autoimmune diseases, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis cannot be cured by a singular approach. This complexity arises because autoimmune conditions typically result from multiple hits to the immune system, including genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, infections, and perturbations in adaptive and innate immunity. However, these multiple hits also offer opportunities to develop targeted, multipronged strategies aimed at achieving lasting remission or even cure. The field of ANCA vasculitis is unique because a subset of patients has successfully discontinued immunosuppression while maintaining remission. This challenges the long-standing belief and paradigm that autoimmunity necessitates lifelong immunosuppression therapy characterized by cycles of relapse and remission. These patients embody the potential for cure.

By exploring theoretical pathways, such as early intervention to modulate innate immunity, restoring normal autoantigen production, enhancing immunoregulatory mechanisms, and eliminating autoreactive cells, we can begin to chart a detailed molecular and cellular roadmap. This approach aims to develop combination therapies that restore immune balance and ultimately transform the management of autoimmune vasculitis, moving toward the goal of durable remission and cure.

### Anca associated vasculitis [^115Wb6NA]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) refers to a group of multi-system autoimmune small vessel vasculitides. These conditions can present at any age and affect approximately 20–25 people per million each year in Europe. In a typical general practice with 8,000 patients, one new case can be expected every five years.

AAV diseases include microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as "Wegener's granulomatosis"), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, previously called "Churg-Strauss syndrome"). These conditions are characterized by the formation of granulomas and inflammation of small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Inflamed vessels may rupture, resulting in alveolar hemorrhage or a purpuric rash, or they may become occluded, causing issues such as segmental glomerular infarction. This leads to a wide array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response, end organ microvascular injury, or the mass effect of granulomas.

### Disease heterogeneity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: Implications for therapeutic approaches [^112MXH5h]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

In recent decades, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis has transformed from an almost uniformly fatal disease to a treatable form of primary systemic vasculitis. Substantial disease heterogeneity exists within ANCA-associated vasculitis, and the increasing understanding of this heterogeneity has implications for guiding treatment decisions. Approaches to induction and maintenance therapy vary depending on disease severity, clinical manifestations, and patient-specific factors. In this narrative review, we examine how disease heterogeneity in ANCA-associated vasculitis, with respect to disease severity, clinical presentations, and ANCA specificity, influences therapeutic decision-making. Many questions regarding therapeutic strategies in ANCA-associated vasculitis remain unanswered, and these should guide future research in this complex group of diseases.

### The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^111oSeuc]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Since 2014, many updated international guidelines have been published addressing the management of AAV. These include the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2021, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 (and update 2024), the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2022, and the European EGPA Study Group (EESG) Nature Evidence Based Guideline 2024, among others. Because extensive literature searches were already conducted for these guidelines, a full systematic review of the literature since 2014 was not repeated. Instead, we accepted the existing literature as presented by the ACR 2021, KDIGO 2021 and update 2024, EULAR 2022, and EESG 2024 guidelines, focusing on their differences.

Additionally, a systematic review of literature published after the EULAR guideline literature review was completed in December 2021 was performed for topics or questions already considered. For new topics not covered in the BSR guideline 2014 or the published international guidelines' literature search, systematic reviews were conducted from December 1990. Key terms were agreed upon among the members of the domain subgroup. Systematic literature searches, conducted in Medline and limited to English language publications, were performed separately for each domain by small working groups. Details of domain-specific literature searches are provided in Supplementary Data S2, available online at Rheumatology.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^116pMZ2F]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

An overwhelming majority of respondents believed in the need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines and supported guideline development by expert group consensus. It is not simple to reconcile these aspirations with the limited uptake of recent pediatric-specific research and consensus reports, although the described lack of knowledge or familiarity, as well as unclear added benefit beyond practice, likely contribute. In view of the high frequency of renal disease (75%) among pediatric AAV patients and the existing high level of cross-specialty collaboration, future efforts towards developing and implementing guidelines for managing patients with AAV must further engage pediatric nephrologists.

A recent European initiative to develop standards of care for pediatric rheumatic diseases, SHARE (Single Hub and Access point for Paediatric Rheumatology in Europe), will soon provide consensus-based guidelines for management of pediatric vasculitides, including GPA. While many of these recommendations will be based on adult data, most survey respondents favored longer-term comparative outcome assessment of a range of possible consensus approaches. Given barriers to uptake of existing pediatric-specific tools, many of which will be part of standardized guidelines, incentives for implementation are critical. A registry that provides treatment guidelines endorsed by national/international rheumatology organizations, access to clinical tools with automated scoring calculators, and individual patient summaries will be essential.

### Clinical practice variation and need for pediatric-specific treatment guidelines among rheumatologists caring for children with ANCA-associated vasculitis: An international clinician survey [^111iy1aC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

- **Respondent characteristics**: Of 216 respondents opening the survey, 209 completed it, yielding an estimated response rate of approximately 40%. Sixty-five (31%) chose to exit as they had not cared for two or more patients with GPA/MPA in the preceding 5 years. The 144 respondents completing the full survey practiced in 36 countries, predominantly the United States (48%), with others from Canada (13%), Italy (4%), Australia (3%), Germany (4%), Turkey (4%), United Kingdom (4%), Brazil (2%), and Sweden (2%). Most respondents (92%) belonged to one or more national or international rheumatology organizations, including CARRA (56%), PRES (32%), CAPRI (10%), the PRES-CARRA Vasculitis Working Group (10%), and others (18%).

Approximately half of respondents had practiced for less than 10 years after formal training (21% for less than 5 years and 26% for 5–10 years); among the rest, 20% each had practiced for 10–20 and 20–30 years, and 10% for 30–40 years. The combined lifetime experience of respondents was at least 1600 patients with GPA/MPA (some shared): 47% had seen fewer than ten patients, 39% had seen 10–20, and only 14% had seen more than 20. The majority of respondents (61%) had seen five or fewer patients with a new diagnosis of GPA or MPA within the past 5 years (mode 3, median 5, IQR 3–8 patients).

Most respondents belonged to group practices, sharing diagnostic and treatment decisions for all patients (46%) or managing patients independently while sharing on-call responsibilities (41%). A minority worked in a solo practice (7%) or in another practice arrangement (6%).

### Current treatment approach to ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1144Cbe8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

This review will attempt to summarize the most potentially impactful new data on the way ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is diagnosed, treated, and monitored.

- **Recent findings**: The newly developed classification criteria for AAV have serious methodological issues that need to be addressed before they are widely adopted. The newly approved drugs and studies into both achieving remission and maintaining it have added to our overall knowledge of managing AAV and should hopefully contribute to improving outcomes in AAV.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of AAV have seen major improvements in the last two years. The remaining issues outlined in this review still need to be addressed to best serve AAV patients.

### Vasculitis syndromes: Which maintenance therapy for ANCA vasculitis [^112siDfH]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides are typically treated with a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide therapy to induce remission. This is commonly followed by maintenance treatment with a less-toxic immunosuppressant. Azathioprine and methotrexate are both options for maintenance therapy, but it is unclear whether one of these immunosuppressants is superior to the other.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113v9wtf]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

- **Maintenance of remission: Duration of immunosuppression**: Maintenance of remission treatment should be continued for a period of 24–48 months (GRADE 1A, SoA 97%). People living with severe renal involvement who remain dialysis dependent have a high risk of infection. Patients with renal-limited disease who remain dialysis dependent may not require ongoing immunotherapy. Maintenance of remission therapy to prevent relapses should be balanced against the risks of immunosuppression (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%).

- **Maintenance of remission: Duration of GC treatment**: The optimum length of treatment with GC during the maintenance phase is uncertain. Depending on immunosuppression, complete GC withdrawal may be possible within 6–12 months following induction of remission treatment (GRADE 2B, SoA 98%).

- **Timing of kidney transplant in GPA and MPA**: People living with GPA or MPA should be in stable clinical remission for at least 6 to 12 months prior to receiving a kidney transplant (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%).
