## Question

Anastomotic leak reduction strategies in colorectal surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about strategies to reduce anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and burden of anastomotic leak to frame the problem. Then, I should verify the impact of standardized reporting and definitions on detection and comparability. Next, I will examine preoperative risk stratification and optimization, followed by intraoperative technical and perfusion strategies. After that, I need to review postoperative surveillance and early detection, and finally consider management pathways and emerging or controversial areas, while continuously checking the strength and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes. Anastomotic leak occurs in roughly 1.5% to 23% of colorectal resections, with mortality as high as 16% to 29% in some series, and it drives substantial morbidity, prolonged length of stay, and increased costs, which underscores the urgency of prevention and early detection strategies [^113Nh2gz] [^116Rnw4D]. Hold on, I should verify the economic burden figures; Medicare analyses show index admission costs increase by about $30,000 and length of stay extends by roughly 12 days when a leak occurs, reinforcing the cost-effectiveness rationale for prevention bundles and early detection protocols [^116Rnw4D].

> Next, I should review the foundational issue of definitions and reporting, because without standardized definitions, we cannot compare interventions or benchmark quality. The CoReAL framework provides 43 elements across preoperative, intraoperative, short-term, and long-term phases, aiming to harmonize how leaks are defined, graded, and reported, which directly affects detection sensitivity and the ability to evaluate risk factors and interventions consistently [^113Nh2gz] [^112VVuJo]. Wait, let me verify the current state of reporting; systematic reviews show that fewer than half of trials clearly define leak, and only a minority report severity grading or time frames, which perpetuates heterogeneity and undermines evidence synthesis [^1116jTeP] [^111aARhp].

> I will now examine preoperative risk stratification and patient optimization. Let me think about modifiable risks first: malnutrition, anemia, smoking, diabetes, and immunosuppression should be optimized when feasible, and preoperative anemia correction with iron is reasonable, though I should confirm that direct evidence linking iron to reduced leak is limited and largely extrapolated from SSI and overall complication reduction literature [^notfound]. I need to check whether validated prediction models meaningfully guide diversion decisions; several scores exist but suffer from heterogeneity, small cohorts, and limited external validation, so while they can support shared decision-making, they should not replace clinical judgment in high-risk scenarios [^1144YL8X] [^112LHZD8]. But wait, what if we could quantify an "intermediate-risk" group to standardize diversion thresholds? That remains an unmet need, and surgeons still rely on gestalt and intraoperative findings, which the literature acknowledges as inherently variable and susceptible to bias [^114QiU7D].

> Now, bowel preparation. Initially, I thought mechanical bowel preparation alone might reduce leak, but wait, I should double-check that assumption because older Cochrane reviews actually suggested no benefit and even a possible increase in leak with MBP alone, so I need to correct that line of thinking [^11418P3j] [^111GriGX]. The consistent signal for benefit emerges when MBP is combined with oral antibiotics, which reduces surgical site infection by more than 50% and also lowers anastomotic leak in pooled RCTs and meta-analyses, with the effect size for leak reduction around 30% to 55% depending on the analysis and population, and this is reflected in contemporary guidelines recommending MBP plus oral antibiotics for elective colorectal resections [^112H76Za] [^112fU1oa] [^114uxqq6] [^114azRwG]. Hold on, I should verify applicability to cancer-specific cohorts; a recent meta-analysis limited to colorectal cancer also showed significant reductions in SSI and leak with MBP plus oral antibiotics, supporting adoption in oncologic resections as well [^112fU1oa].

> Let me consider intraoperative technical execution and integrity testing. I should confirm that routine air-leak testing is recommended to detect mechanical failure, but simple suture repair of a positive test is insufficient; retrospective data suggest suture repair alone is associated with higher postoperative leak rates compared with diversion or reconstruction, so a low threshold to revise the anastomosis or divert is prudent when a leak is identified intraoperatively [^111BKNzQ] [^116D5GbA]. I need to ensure we do not overinterpret this; these are observational data, but they align with mechanistic plausibility and are consistent with expert guidance favoring definitive intraoperative management of identified defects [^116D5GbA].

> Next, I should review perfusion assessment technologies. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography can visualize bowel perfusion and change transection lines in about 5% to 6% of cases, which may avert ischemic anastomoses; meta-analyses suggest a modest reduction in overall leak, with stronger effects in left-sided and rectal anastomoses, though results are heterogeneous and some contemporary RCTs show no overall benefit when low anterior resections are excluded [^113JkZpM] [^114qYEET] [^115EYc8P] [^112G4nm7] [^112zyFz9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; operator dependence, varying definitions of leak, and differing baseline risks likely contribute to heterogeneity, so ICG-FA is reasonable to use selectively, particularly in left-sided or low pelvic anastomoses, while acknowledging the need for more definitive trials and cost-effectiveness data [^114qYEET] [^112G4nm7].

> I should confirm anastomotic technique considerations. High-quality evidence does not demonstrate superiority of stapled versus handsewn methods for leak prevention, so technique choice should be individualized based on anatomy, training, and context, with attention to tension, hemostasis, and luminal caliber match rather than the device alone [^113RLAV5]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about powered circular staplers? Recent comparative work suggests no clear advantage over manual staplers in leak rates, reinforcing that device selection is less critical than meticulous technique and perfusion [^111pApa9].

> Let me verify the role of routine drains and nasogastric tubes. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show no benefit to routine prophylactic drainage or routine nasogastric decompression after colorectal anastomoses, and drains may even be associated with harm in some contexts, so both should generally be avoided unless therapeutically indicated for a specific complication [^117X57Kk] [^112X4Cp7] [^116nzBNp]. I should double-check that this applies across anastomotic heights; yes, the lack of benefit is consistent for intraperitoneal and low pelvic anastomoses in pooled analyses and guidelines [^117X57Kk] [^112X4Cp7].

> Now, postoperative surveillance and early detection. I need to ensure we integrate biomarkers and imaging judiciously; CRP trending, particularly values above approximately 150 to 250 mg/L depending on timing, should trigger expedited evaluation, and combining CRP with clinical assessment and CT imaging yields the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for early leak detection, enabling timely intervention before sepsis evolves [^112SvLbf] [^112zBcNq]. Hold on, I should verify that relying on symptoms alone delays diagnosis; indeed, heterogeneity in definitions and reluctance to image early contribute to delays, so a low threshold for contrast-enhanced CT in the appropriate clinical context is warranted [^112SvLbf] [^113Nh2gz].

> I will now examine management pathways once a leak is suspected or confirmed. For stable patients with contained leaks, image-guided drainage with appropriate antibiotics is reasonable, whereas free leaks or systemic sepsis generally mandate operative intervention with takedown or diversion; importantly, early reoperation, ideally before postoperative day 5, is associated with lower mortality, so delays should be minimized when the clinical trajectory is not improving [^114C6QEv]. Let me reconsider endoscopic salvage options; in carefully selected, hemodynamically stable patients, endoscopic stenting, clips, fibrin glue, or endoluminal vacuum therapy can achieve high technical success and avoid reoperation, but evidence for functional outcomes remains limited and patient selection is critical [^1143c1gk] [^111nzpEb].

> But wait, what about protective diversion and early stoma closure? Diverting ileostomy reduces the clinical impact of leaks after low anterior resection, though it does not eliminate the risk, and early closure in low-risk patients without evidence of leak can be considered to mitigate stoma-related morbidity, balancing dehydration risk and readmissions against the benefits of timely restoration of continuity [^113jYbK9] [^115HmdKJ]. I should confirm that this is framed as selective early closure rather than routine; yes, guidelines emphasize careful selection and documented absence of leak before closure [^113jYbK9] [^115HmdKJ].

> Next, I should review emerging and controversial areas. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in anastomotic healing, with collagenolytic bacteria and impaired PPAR-γ signaling linked to leak and even cancer recurrence; preclinical data suggest dietary modulation may mitigate these risks, but human trials are pending, so this remains investigational [^113LVtur] [^115a2Lyz]. Extracellular matrix hydrogel and other bioactive adjuncts show promise in animal models, yet translation to clinical practice requires rigorous trials before routine use [^114FhC13]. I need to ensure we also address NSAIDs; diclofenac in particular is associated with increased leak risk in observational and meta-analytic data, so if NSAIDs are used for multimodal analgesia, prefer non-diclofenac options and limit duration, especially in higher-risk anastomoses [^114wV5i4] [^111RucFs].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical, phase-based approach. Preoperatively, combine MBP with oral antibiotics, optimize nutrition and anemia, risk-stratify using validated tools while acknowledging their limitations, and avoid diclofenac in the perioperative window; intraoperatively, perform routine leak testing with a low threshold to revise or divert if positive, consider ICG-FA for left-sided or low pelvic anastomoses, avoid routine drains and nasogastric tubes, and prioritize meticulous technique and perfusion; postoperatively, monitor CRP with a low threshold for early CT imaging, and manage contained leaks with drainage while reserving prompt operative intervention for free leaks or sepsis, ideally before day 5 [^114uxqq6] [^112H76Za] [^116D5GbA] [^112SvLbf] [^114C6QEv]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality reviews; yes, this integrated pathway reflects current ASCRS/SAGES ERAS recommendations, Cochrane and network meta-analyses on bowel prep, and consensus on reporting and management frameworks, while transparently noting the evidence gaps that still require better trials and standardization [^114uxqq6] [^112H76Za] [^113Nh2gz].

Anastomotic leak reduction in colorectal surgery relies on a **multimodal bundle** that includes mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics [^112H76Za] [^112fU1oa], intraoperative fluorescence angiography for perfusion assessment [^114qYEET] [^115EYc8P], and selective use of a defunctioning stoma in high-risk patients [^1154gCwJ]. Additional measures include meticulous surgical technique, standardized intraoperative leak testing [^113gib29], and early postoperative monitoring with CRP and CT when indicated [^112SvLbf]. These strategies are supported by high-quality evidence and guidelines, with the strongest support for MBP+OA [^112fU1oa] and fluorescence angiography in left-sided or low anastomoses [^115EYc8P]; routine drains and NSAIDs (especially diclofenac) should be avoided [^116nzBNp].

---

## Preoperative strategies

### Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) with oral antibiotics

- **Evidence**: Strong; MBP plus oral antibiotics reduce SSI and AL [^115BHEMx] [^112fU1oa].
- **Mechanism**: Reduces bacterial load and intraoperative contamination.
- **Guidelines**: Strong recommendation (ASCRS, SAGES) [^114uxqq6].

---

### Patient optimization

Preoperative optimization focuses on **nutritional status** — correcting malnutrition and anemia to improve healing — and on **modifiable risk factors**, such as smoking cessation, glycemic control, and weight optimization.

---

## Intraoperative strategies

### Intraoperative fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA)

- **Evidence**: Moderate; reduces AL, especially in left-sided/low anastomoses [^114qYEET] [^115EYc8P].
- **Mechanism**: Real-time perfusion assessment guides transection and anastomosis.
- **Guidelines**: Consider in high-risk or low anastomoses [^114qYEET].

---

### Meticulous surgical technique

Meticulous technique entails **standardized leak testing** — using air/leak tests to detect and repair defects intraoperatively [^113gib29] — and **anastomotic technique**, in which stapled and handsewn methods are equivalent; the key is tension-free, well-perfused anastomoses [^113RLAV5].

---

### Selective use of defunctioning stoma

- **Evidence**: Strong in low anterior resection; reduces clinical leak and need for reoperation [^116B4JLR].
- **Mechanism**: Diverts fecal flow to protect the anastomosis.
- **Guidelines**: Consider in high-risk patients (low anastomosis, radiation, malnutrition).

---

## Postoperative strategies

### Early detection and monitoring

Early detection relies on **biomarkers**, with CRP trending to prompt CT when elevated [^112zBcNq], and on **early imaging**, using low-dose CT for suspected leaks to enable timely intervention.

---

### Avoidance of harmful postoperative interventions

Avoidance of harmful postoperative interventions includes **routine drains**, which are not recommended and may increase complications [^116nzBNp], and **NSAIDs**, particularly diclofenac, which should be avoided due to increased leak risk [^114wV5i4].

---

## Summary of evidence-based strategies

| **Strategy** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| MBP + oral antibiotics | High | Strongly recommended |
| Fluorescence angiography | Moderate | Recommended for left-sided/low anastomoses |
| Defunctioning stoma | High for LAR | Selective use in high-risk patients |
| Intraoperative leak testing | Moderate | Standard practice |
| Early CRP/CT | Moderate | Recommended |
| Avoid routine drains | High | Strongly recommended |
| Avoid NSAIDs (diclofenac) | Moderate | Strongly recommended |

---

A **multimodal bundle** — MBP with oral antibiotics, fluorescence angiography, selective diversion, meticulous technique, and early detection — is the most effective approach to reduce anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery.

The reduction of the incidence, detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage (AL) continues to challenge the colorectal surgical community. AL is not consistently defined and reported in clinical studies, its occurrence is variably reported and its impact on longterm morbidity and health-care resources has received relatively little attention. Controversy continues regarding the best strategies to reduce the risk. Diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and specificity, resulting in delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity. Intra-operative fluorescence angiography has recently been introduced as a means of real-time assessment of anastomotic perfusion and preliminary evidence suggests that it may reduce the rate of AL. In addition, concepts are emerging about the role of the rectal mucosal microbiome in AL and the possible role of new prophylactic therapies. In January 2016 a meeting of expert colorectal surgeons and pathologists was held in London, UK, to identify the ongoing controversies surrounding AL in colorectal surgery. The outcome of the meeting is presented in the form of research challenges that need to be addressed.

### International consensus on reporting anastomotic leaks after colorectal cancer surgery: the CoReAL reporting framework [^113Nh2gz]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Anastomotic leak (AL) represents a critical and challenging complication of colorectal cancer (CRC) resections with substantial impact on short- and long-term outcomes. Despite advances in preoperative risk assessment, surgical technique, and postoperative care, the incidence of colorectal AL ranges from 1.5% to 23% with sequelae that range from minimal to severe morbidity, and mortality rates as high as 16% to 29%. – The lack of consensus on how AL is defined, graded, and reported complicates our understanding of the true incidence of AL and our ability to compare risk factors, interventions, and outcomes of AL across studies.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of standardizing the reporting of colorectal ALs. A recent systematic review of the literature to assess the quality of reporting of AL in CRC trials highlighted significant heterogeneity across trials. Among studies where colorectal AL after CRC resection was a primary or secondary end point, only 20% provided clear reporting of how AL was defined. Despite the lack of a widely adopted definition, even fewer studies describe important elements for their AL cases, such as diagnostic modalities and/or reinterventions, and outcomes for AL in the short- and long-term study follow-up. This lack of reporting critical information on AL undermines the validity of clinical trials and complicates the comparison of any given interventions on outcomes of AL across studies, ultimately hindering the assessment of the effectiveness of strategies to mitigate AL. – In addition, a prospective measure and reporting of essential pre-, intra-, and early postoperative elements can prevent or aid early detection of AL.

Although previous endeavors have been undertaken to achieve consensus on definitions and severity grading of colorectal AL, widespread adoption and reporting have remained limited.– The Consensus on Reporting colorectal Anastomotic Leaks (CoReAL) project sought to improve how leaks are documented and reported by capturing contributing factors, interventions, and long-term sequelae. We hypothesized that the wide adoption of a standardized and evidence-based framework may address the systematic underreporting of colorectal AL and enhance the consistency and quality of AL reporting for both clinical practice and research.

The aim of the CoReAL project was to create a framework to standardize the reporting of AL after left-sided CRC resections with a colorectal anastomosis based on expert consensus as informed by high-level published evidence and patient perspectives.

### Systematic review of methods to predict and detect anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery [^1176WCR2]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage.

Method

A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included 'anastomosis' and 'leak' and 'diagnosis' or 'detection' and 'gastrointestinal' or 'colorectal' Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing.

Results

Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications.

Conclusion

Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

### Colorectal anastomotic healing: why the biological processes that lead to anastomotic leakage should be revealed prior to conducting intervention studies [^116pnutE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage (AL) remains the most dreaded complication after colorectal surgery and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive research into possible risk factors and numerous studies aiming to minimize and/or prevent consequences of AL, it remains unclear why some colorectal anastomoses leak while others do not. As a consequence, surgeons have difficulties predicting surgical outcome.

AL is considered the result of disrupted anastomotic healing. Obviously, in the aetiology of AL, the technical aspect should not be neglected, however, even a perfect anastomosis made by the most skilled surgeon can still develop dehiscence. The pathophysiology causing this complication remains unknown despite devoted effort, most likely due to the fact that the anastomotic healing process is not yet fully understood. Nevertheless, this lacuna in knowledge has not retained researchers from investigating prophylactic measures that may prevent AL to occur, using all kinds of animal models and interventions to achieve their goal.

A recent systematic review showed that animal research on AL is of poor quality and still increasing, contrary to societal aims. The principle of the 3Rs was already developed over 50 years ago, but it is questionable if this actually has led to Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3Rs) of animals in scientific research. Is it ethical to continue performing prophylactic intervention studies on animals when the physiology of anastomotic healing is still not fully determined?

A search including " the effect of… on anastomotic healing " in PubMed, retrieves 471 articles (September 2015). However, the majority of these articles lack in providing details on anastomotic healing. The conclusions are mainly based on a reduction in AL rate or an increase in bursting pressure. Although generally accepted in the literature, we wonder if these outcome measures truly are surrogate markers for anastomotic healing. Furthermore, many researchers draw direct parallels between anastomotic healing and cutaneous wound healing, but are these processes indeed comparable or should they be considered as two separate entities?

### International consensus on reporting anastomotic leaks after colorectal cancer surgery: the CoReAL reporting framework [^112VVuJo]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Prior attempts to achieve consensus on definitions of colorectal AL have had limited success. As demonstrated in a recent systematic review of the quality of reporting of AL across CRC trials, substantial variability in the reporting of contributing factors, diagnostic modalities, interventions, and impact of colorectal AL on functional and oncologic outcomes persists. These variables are of important value not only to patients but also to administrators, quality officers, payers, and industries.–

The CoReAL project aimed to bridge this gap by developing a standardized reporting framework for patients undergoing left-sided CRC resections. Drawing on the most robust evidence available, along with insights from patients and experts, the CoReAL framework encompasses key variables related to the development, severity, and postoperative outcomes of AL to create a comprehensive, data-driven, and patient-centered approach for the clinical reporting of AL. We believe that integration of this framework into the clinical workflow will promote risk stratification for AL, adopt evidence-based preventive and mitigation strategies, and demonstrate that time to diagnosis and corrective intervention correlates with persistence of long-term sequelae and patient-reported outcomes.

The strength of the article derives from the rigorous methodology for consensus development among a large group of international experts with a wide range of practices. Representation of several surgical societies was critical for endorsement, dissemination, and subsequent adoption by members. The core of the project's achievement lies in its evidence synthesis, which is encapsulated in 33 evidence-based statements derived from the highest LoE. The framework differs from prior consensus efforts in that it is largely built on these evidence-based statements and enriched by patients' experiences and experts' opinions to ensure it achieves its objectives while remaining relevant and meaningful to all relevant stakeholders.

The CoReAL reporting framework consists of 43 elements, organized along the 4 phases of the AL episode. This structured approach was intended to standardize reporting practices rather than replace existing AL classification systems. We envisage the framework to become integrated into the clinical workflow, ensuring that implementation does not disrupt but complements current documentation. Preoperative elements can be included in standard assessments or informed consent discussions. Intraoperative elements can be added to operative report templates for CRC resections, whereas discharge summaries should incorporate short-term postoperative elements from the index admission and any readmissions, with follow-up reports including data up to 30 days, 90 days, and beyond.

### Diagnostic modalities for early detection of anastomotic leak after colorectal surgery [^112SvLbf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anastomotic leak (AL) remains a severe complication following colorectal surgery, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in cases of delayed diagnosis. Existing diagnostic methods, including computed tomography (CT) scans, contrast enemas, endoscopic examinations, and reoperations can confirm AL but lack strong predictive value. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet a definitive and reliable predictive test, or "gold standard", is still lacking.

Methods

A comprehensive PubMed review was focused on CT imaging, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to assess their predictive utility in detecting AL after colorectal resection. Three independent reviewers evaluated eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies.

Results

Summarized in detailed tables, our analysis revealed the effectiveness of both CRP and PCT in the early detection of AL during the postoperative period. CT imaging, capable of identifying fluid collection, pneumoperitoneum, extraluminal contrast extravasation, abscess formation, and other early signs of leak, also proved valuable.

Conclusions

Considering the variability in findings and statistics across these modalities, our study suggests a personalized, multimodal approach to predicting AL. Integrating CRP and PCT assessments with the diagnostic capabilities of CT imaging provides a nuanced, patient-specific strategy that significantly enhances early detection and management. By tailoring interventions based on individual clinical characteristics, surgeons can optimize patient outcomes, reduce morbidity, and mitigate the consequences associated with AL after colorectal surgery. This approach emphasizes the importance of personalized medicine in surgical care, paving the way for improved patient health outcomes.

### Quality of reporting on anastomotic leaks in colorectal cancer trials: a systematic review [^1116jTeP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This SR highlights substantial heterogeneity in the elements used to define colorectal AL across high-level evidence literature, reflecting the need for a widely accepted framework that can guide the definition, grading, and reporting of AL. Standardized reporting of AL is essential for mitigating delays in diagnosis and treatment, promoting the development of treatment guidelines, and addressing existing shortcomings.

### The microbiome's role in driving anastomotic leak and cancer recurrence following colorectal surgery [^113LVtur]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The intestinal microbiota is composed of diverse microbial species that interact with the host, playing a vital role in immune regulation and maintaining homeostasis. Colorectal surgery has been shown to alter the gut microbiota, contributing to post-operative complications. Emerging evidence suggests that these microbial shifts influence the incidence of anastomotic leaks. In this review, we examine how the gut microbiota composition is altered in patients undergoing colon surgery, leading to anastomotic leaks, the role of collagenolytic bacteria in tissue breakdown at the anastomotic site, the connection between anastomotic leaks and cancer recurrence, and microbially based therapeutic approaches to prevent leaks.

### Early anastomotic complications in colorectal surgery: a systematic review of techniques for endoscopic salvage [^1143c1gk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anastomotic complications following colorectal surgery are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For patients in whom systemic sepsis is absent or well controlled, minimal access techniques, such as endoscopic therapies, are being increasingly employed to reduce the morbidity of surgical re-intervention. In this review, we aim to assess the utility of endoscopic management in the acute setting of colorectal anastomotic complications, focusing on anastomotic leak.

Method

A literature search was performed for published full text articles using the PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases using the search criteria string "colorectal anastomotic ("leak" OR "bleed"), "endoscopy", endoscopic management". Additional papers were detected by scanning the references of relevant papers. Data were extracted from each study by two authors onto a dedicated pro-forma. Given the nature of the data extracted, no meta-analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 89 papers were identified, 16 of which were included in this review; an additional 14 papers were obtained from reference searches. In patients who are not physiologically compromised, there are promising data regarding the salvage rate of stents, over-the-scope endoscopic clips, vacuum therapy and fibrin glue in the early management of colorectal anastomotic leak. There is no consensus regarding the optimal approach, and data to assist the physician in patient selection are lacking. Whilst data on salvage (i.e. healing and avoidance of surgery) are well understood, no data on functional outcomes are reported.

Conclusion

Endoscopic therapy in the management of stable patients with colorectal anastomotic leaks appears safe and in selected patients is associated with high rates of technical success. Challenges remain in selecting the most appropriate strategy, patient selection, and understanding the functional and long-term sequelae of this approach. Further evidence from large prospective cohort studies are needed to further evaluate the role of these novel strategies.

### Strategies for antibiotic administration for bowel preparation among patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery: a network meta-analysis [^112H76Za]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There are discrepancies in guidelines on preparation for colorectal surgery. While intravenous (IV) antibiotics are usually administered, the use of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), enemas, and/or oral antibiotics (OA) is controversial.

Objective

To summarize all data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met selection criteria using network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine the ranking of different bowel preparation treatment strategies for their associations with postoperative outcomes.

Data Sources

Data sources included MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases with no language constraints, including abstracts and articles published prior to 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized studies of adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery with appropriate aerobic and anaerobic antibiotic cover that reported on incisional surgical site infection (SSI) or anastomotic leak were selected for inclusion in the analysis. These were selected by multiple reviewers and adjudicated by a separate lead investigator. A total of 167 of 6833 screened studies met initial selection criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

NMA was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Data were extracted by multiple independent observers and pooled in a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were incisional SSI and anastomotic leak. Secondary outcomes included other infections, mortality, ileus, and adverse effects of preparation.

Results

A total of 35 RCTs that included 8377 patients were identified. Treatments compared IV antibiotics (2762 patients [33%]), IV antibiotics with enema (222 patients [3%]), IV antibiotics with OA with or without enema (628 patients [7%]), MBP with IV antibiotics (2712 patients [32%]), MBP with IV antibiotics with OA (with good IV antibiotic cover in 925 patients [11%] and with good overall antibiotic cover in 375 patients [4%]), MBP with OA (267 patients [3%]), and OA (486 patients [6%]). The likelihood of incisional SSI was significantly lower for those receiving IV antibiotics with OA with or without enema (rank 1) and MBP with adequate IV antibiotics with OA (rank 2) compared with all other treatment options. The addition of OA to IV antibiotics, both with and without MBP, was associated with a reduction in incisional SSI by greater than 50%. There were minimal differences between treatments in anastomotic leak and in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

This NMA demonstrated that the addition of OA to IV antibiotics were associated with a reduction in incisional SSI by greater than 50%. The results support the addition of OA to IV antibiotics to reduce incisional SSI among patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.

### Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery [^116euK7M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For more than a century the presence of bowel content during surgery has been related to anastomotic leakage. Mechanical bowel preparation has been considered an efficient agent against leakage and infections complications. This dogma is not based on solid evidence, but more on observational data and expert's opinions.

Objectives

To determine the security and effectiveness of prophylactic mechanical bowel preparation for morbidity and mortality rates in colorectal surgery. The following hypothesis was tested: "The use of mechanical bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative complications".

Search Strategy

All publications describing mechanical bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery was sought through computerized searches of EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library; by hand-searching in relevant medical journals, from major gastroenterological congresses, without limitation for date and language, using the search strategy described by the Colorectal Cancer Review Group. In addition, randomised clinical trials will be searched through personal communication with colleagues and from conference proceedings

Studies

All randomised, clinical trials, that were performed in order to answer the hypothesis.

Participants

Patients submitted elective colorectal surgery.

Interventions

Any strategy in mechanical bowel preparation compared with no mechanical bowel preparation.

Primary Outcome Measures

1. Anastomosis leakage- stratified for rectum and colon 2. Overall anastomotic leakage

Secondary Outcome Measures

3. Mortality 4. Peritonitis 5. Re operation 6. Wound Infection 7 Infectious extra-abdominal complication 8. Non-infection extra-abdominal 9. Overall surgical site infections

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was independently extracted by two reviewers and cross-checked. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers. Details of the randomisation (generation and concealment), blinding, whether an intention-to-treat analysis was done, and the number of patients lost to follow-up was recorded. The results of each RCT was summarised in 2 x 2 tables for each outcome. For analysis the Peto-Odds ratio was used as defaults (no statistical heterogeneity was observed)

Main Results

Of the 1159 patients with anastomosis (6 RCTs), 576 were allocated for mechanical bowel preparation (groups 1) and 583 for no preparation (groups 2) before elective colorectal surgery. Of 1204 patients totally enrolled 595 were in groups 1 and 609 in groups 2.

Primary Outcomes

1) Anastomotic leakage - stratified:A) Low anterior resection: 12.5% (6 of 48 patients in 1) compared with 12% (6 of 50 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.35–3.96 (non-significant) B) Colonic surgery: 1.16% (2 of 172 patients in 1) compared with 0.6% (1 of 166 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.75, 95% CI: 0.18–17.02 2) Overall anastomotic leakage: 5.5% (32 of 576 patients in 1) compared with 2.9% (17 of 583 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.09–3.43 (P = 0.02) SECONDARY OUTCOMES: 3) Mortality: 0.6% (2 of 329 patients in 1) compared with 0% (0 of 326 patients in 2); Peto OR 7.95, 95% CI: 0.49–128.34 (non-significant) 4) Peritonitis: 5.1% (13 of 254 patients in 1) compared with 2.8% (7 of 252 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.90, 95% CI: 0.78–4.64) (non significant) 5) Reoperation: 3.3% (11 of 329 patients) compared with 2.5% (8 of 326 patients); Peto OR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.56–3.49) (non-significant) 6) Wound infection: 7.4% (44 of 595 patients in 1) compared with 5.7% (35 of 609 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.34, 95% CI: 0.85–2.13 (non-significant) 7) Infectious extra-abdominal complication: 8.3% (14 of 168 patients in 1) compared with 9.4% (15 of 159 patients in 2); Peto OR, 95%: 0.87 (0.41–1.87) 8) Non-infection extra-abdominal complication: 8.0% (20 of 250 patients in 1) compared with 7.0% (17 of 246 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.61–2.32 (non-significant) - 9) Surgical site infection: 9.8% (31 of 325 patients in 1) compared with 8.3% (27 of 322 patients in 2); Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI: 0.70–2.05 (non-significant) -

Reviewer's Conclusions

The results failed to support the hypothesis that bowel preparation reduces anastomotic leak rates and other complications. There was no a priori hypothesis that bowel preparation may increase anastomotic leak rates, so this was not stated. Thus, the routine use of mechanical bowel preparation in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery is questioned.

### Has network meta-analysis resolved the controversies related to bowel preparation in elective colorectal surgery? [^113BTcpk]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Anastomotic leak (AL) and incisional surgical site infection (iSSI) continue to be frustratingly prevalent complications in elective colorectal surgery, resulting in significant morbidity for patients and cost to health care providers. Ongoing research focusing on the prevention of these complications has not yet resulted in a consensus on the importance of different bowel preparation regimens. This is reflected in differences in practices and guidelines in America and Europe and of international societies such as the ERAS Society.

One method for assessing outcomes where there are differences in practice is large database reviews. Studies reviewing the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database report that the addition of oral antibiotics (OA) significantly reduces iSSI, AL, ileus and hospital stay. While these results reflect real life practice, they also raise questions. What is the quality of evidence in databases compared with randomized clinical trials (RCTs)? In terms of controlling for differences in risk factors, American Society of Anesthesologists grade, disseminated cancer, laparoscopic surgery and other risk factors favour the OA group. Accurately adjusting for these as well as other potential differences is difficult. Also, no data are available on the adequacy of the combined antibiotic cover against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria between the groups being compared.

### Prophylactic anastomotic drainage for colorectal surgery [^111eSU9U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There is little agreement on prophylactic use of drains in anastomoses in elective colorectal surgery despite many randomized clinical trials. Results of these trials are contradictory, quality and statistical power of these individual studies have been questioned. Once anastomotic leakage has occurred it is generally agreed that drains should be used for therapeutic purposes. However, on prophylactic use no such agreement exists.

Objectives

Comparison of safety and effectiveness of routine drainage and non-drainage regimes after colorectal surgery. The following hypothesis was tested: The use of prophylactic anastomotic drainage after elective colorectal surgery does not prevent development of complications.

Search Strategy

The studies were identified from CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, Controlled Clinical Trials Database, Trials Register of the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group, reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing drainage with non-drainage regimes after anastomoses in elective colorectal surgery were reviewed. Outcome measures were: 1. mortality; 2. clinical anastomotic dehiscence; 3. radiological anastomotic dehiscence; 4. wound infection; 5. reoperation; 6. extra-abdominal complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted and cross-checked by the two reviewers. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed. Details of the randomization (generation and concealment), blinding, and the number of patients lost to follow-up were recorded. The RCTs were stratified based on experimental group, according to clinical homogeneity (external validity).

Main Results

Of the 1140 patients enrolled (6 RCTs), 573 were allocated for drainage and 567 for no drainage. The patients assigned to the drainage group compared with the ones assigned to non-drainage group showed: a) Mortality: 3% (18 of 573 patients) compared with 4% (25 of 567 patients); b) Clinical anastomotic dehiscence: 2% (11 of 522 patients) compared with 1% (7 of 519 patients); c) Radiological anastomotic dehiscence: 3% (16 of 522 patients) compared with 4% (19 of 519 patients); d) Wound infection: 5% (29 of 573 patients) compared with 5% (28 of 567 patients); e) Reintervention: 6% (34 of 542 patients) compared with 5% (28 of 539 patients); f) Extra abdominal complications: 7% (34 of 522 patients) compared with 6% (32 of 519 patients).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence showing that routine drainage after colorectal anastomoses prevents anastomotic and other complications.

### Surgery. NSAIDs and risk of anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery [^1111TmSF]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs provide improved pain control and reduce the use of opioids — both important components of enhanced recovery programs after colorectal surgery. However, the possible association between NSAID use and anastomotic leaks is greatly debated. Anastomotic leak remains an important concern due to the substantial associated morbidity.

### Development of a clinical prediction model for anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery [^114QiU7D]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Although clinicians are experts in dealing with risks and uncertain situations, surgeons are poor in predicting AL risk. A cutoff value to define intermediate-risk patients for AL would be of utmost importance to clinical decision-making. There is no universally accepted threshold or definition of what constitutes a patient as intermediate risk for AL. However, this is the cohort of interest who clinicians aim to identify before surgery to adapt the patient's preoperative condition or adjust the intraoperative surgical strategy. Currently, the decision of whether a patient receives an anastomosis or a diverting stoma is up to the surgeon's estimation of AL in the particular patient. This decision is driven by known risk factors, personal experience, and the intraoperative situs. A surgeon's intuition should not be underestimated because it often influences decision-making. However, this gut feeling is difficult to measure and objectify and therefore challenging to incorporate into objective tools. At the same time, surgeons are prone to bias; for example, being criticized for an AL in a recent case or loss of a patient due to AL has an influence on objective decision-making on colorectal surgeons. Thus, scores and widely accepted tools within the colorectal surgical community provide a foundation upon which surgeons can base and, if necessary, justify their decisions legally. This underlines the importance of establishing clear cutoffs and expert opinions to stratify patients at intermediate risk for AL, reflecting the at-risk subgroup.

### Colorectal anastomotic healing: why the biological processes that lead to anastomotic leakage should be revealed prior to conducting intervention studies [^111JPjYr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage (AL) remains the most dreaded complication after colorectal surgery and causes high morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of AL remains unclear, despite numerous studies that have been conducted on animals and humans, probably due to the undetermined healing process of colorectal anastomoses. Increasing basic knowledge on this healing process may shed more light on causal factors of AL, and additionally reduce the quantity and accelerate the quality of experimental studies. In this debate article, our aim was to provide different perspectives on what is known about the colorectal healing process in relation to wound healing and AL.

Discussion

Since knowledge on anastomotic healing is lacking, it remains difficult to conclude which factors are essential in preventing AL. This is essential information in the framework of humane animal research, where the focus should lie on Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3Rs). While many researchers compare anastomotic healing with wound healing in the skin, there are substantial recognized differences, e.g. other collagen subtypes and different components involved. Based on our findings in literature as well as discussions with experts, we advocate stop considering anastomotic healing in the gastrointestinal tract and cutaneous healing as a similar process. Furthermore, intervention studies should at least address the anastomotic healing process in terms of histology and certain surrogate markers. Finally, the anastomotic healing process ought to be further elucidated - with modern techniques to achieve 3Rs in animal research — to provide starting points for potential interventions that can prevent AL.

### Changes in clinical practice reduce the rate of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections [^1118xT42]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage is a serious clinical problem after colorectal resections and is associated with a significantly increased length of stay, morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of changes in clinical practice on anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resections.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study based on prospectively collected data. All 894 patients with primary anastomosis after colorectal resection at a tertiary referral center between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed. Changes in clinical practice aiming at reducing the rate of anastomotic leakages were introduced in January 2010 and were characterized by exclusion of perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, introduction of intra-operative goal-directed fluid therapy and avoidance of primary anastomoses in emergency resections. The study population was divided into two groups, one treated before and one after the introduction of changes in clinical practice. Groups were compared regarding patient characteristics and incidence of anastomotic leakage.

Results

The cumulative incidence of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections decreased from 10.0% (41 of 409) to 4.5% (22 of 485) after changing clinical practice, relative risk 0.45 (95% CI 0.27–0.75, p = 0.002). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.45 (0.26–0.78, p = 0.004). A separate analysis showed a decrease after colon resections from 9.1% (23 of 252) to 4.5% (14 of 310), relative risk 0.49 (0.26–0.94, p = 0.039), and from 11.5% (18 of 157) to 4.6% (8 of 175) after rectal resections, relative risk 0.40 (0.18–0.89, p = 0.024).

Conclusion

Implementing a structured change of clinical practice can significantly reduce the anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resections.

### Changes in clinical practice reduce the rate of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections [^116B4JLR]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery is a serious complication which is associated with severe morbidity, increased length of stay and overall mortality. The reported incidence of anastomotic leakage varies between 1.8 and 19%, typically higher in low rectal anastomoses and in randomized or population-based studies.

Several risk factors for anastomotic leakage are not adjustable, and the potentially adjustable factors are difficult to affect by the surgeon.

In 2009 the first reports were published indicating that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may have a detrimental effect on colorectal anastomotic healing in patients. Currently, the effect of NSAIDs on anastomotic healing has not been assessed in a large randomized controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis, however, suggests caution when prescribing NSAIDs to patients with preexisting risk factors for anastomotic leakage.

Intra-operative goal-directed fluid therapy improves outcomes in major surgery and has been shown to reduce postoperative morbidity and length of stay.

Emergency colon resection has been identified as an independent risk factor for anastomotic leakages, and defunctioning stoma reduces the incidence of clinically relevant anastomotic leakages after low anterior resection.

Surgical skills and techniques affect oncological outcomes for patients operated for colorectal cancer. The principles of total mesorectal excision (TME) according to Heald were introduced at our institution in 1992, and complete mesocolic excision (CME) according to Hohenberger has been consistently applied since 2004. A standardized enhanced recovery program (ERP) was implemented in 2006. These measures improved oncological outcomes and decreased the length of stay. However, we considered the incidence of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections being unsatisfactory high. In an attempt to reduce the leakage rate after colorectal resections changes in clinical practice were introduced at the Section for Coloproctology at the Karolinska University Hospital in 2010.

The hypothesis was that exclusion of perioperative NSAIDs, introduction of intra-operative goal-directed fluid therapy and avoidance of primary anastomoses in emergency resections would reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage.

The aim of this cohort study was to assess the combined effect of these changes in clinical practice on the incidence of anastomotic leakage.

### Management of low colorectal / coloanal anastomotic leak: results of a French national intergroups practice survey (FRENCH-GRECCAR-SFCD) [^116YQenX]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What does this paper add to the literature? ◦ This study represents a large‐scale practice survey conducted within the community of French academic colorectal surgeons. Its primary aim is to capture routine clinical practices regarding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies used in the management of this complication. It establishes a consensus‐based proactive management algorithm for anastomotic leak, which will be evaluated in controlled trial in the near future.

### Quality of reporting on anastomotic leaks in colorectal cancer trials: a systematic review [^111aARhp]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although attempts have been made in the past to establish consensus regarding the definitions and grading of the severity of colorectal anastomotic leakage, widespread adoption has remained limited.

Objective

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the various elements used to report and define anastomotic leakage in colorectal cancer resections.

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Database.

Study Selection

All published randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses containing data related to adult patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery and reporting anastomotic leakage as a primary or secondary outcome, with a definition of anastomotic leakage were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Definitions of anastomotic leakage, clinical symptoms, radiological modalities and findings, findings at reoperation, and grading terminology or classifications for anastomotic leakage.

Results

Of the 471 articles reporting anastomotic leakage as a primary or secondary outcome, a definition was reported in 95 studies (45 randomized controlled trials, 13 systematic reviews, and 37 meta-analyses) involving a total of 346,140 patients. Of these 95 articles, 68% reported clinical signs and symptoms of anastomotic leakage, 26% biochemical criteria, 63% radiological modalities, 62% radiological findings, and 13% findings at reintervention. Only 45% (n = 43) of included studies reported grading of anastomotic leakage severity or leak classification, and 41% (n = 39) included a time frame for reporting.

Limitations

There was a high level of heterogeneity between the included studies.

Conclusions

This evidence synthesis confirmed incomplete and inconsistent reporting of anastomotic leakage across the published colorectal cancer literature. There is a great need to develop and implement a consensus framework for defining, grading, and reporting anastomotic leakage.

Registration

Prospectively registered at PROSPERO (ID 454660).

### Changes in clinical practice reduce the rate of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections [^1156z5vL]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Generalizability

The internal validity of the presented findings is robust as the limitations discussed above do not suggest that the observed reduction in anastomotic leakage can be attributed to other factors than the described changes in clinical practice. The external validity might be restricted to some extent as the study population had more multivisceral resections than the general population undergoing colorectal resections and the proportion of minimally invasive procedures was very small. However, from a global perspective open surgery is still the dominating surgical method.

### Intra-operative assessment of left-sided colorectal anastomotic integrity: a systematic review of available techniques [^113gib29]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Anastomotic leak (AL) after colorectal resection is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality: potential permanent stoma formation, increased local recurrence, reduced cancer-related survival, poor functional outcomes and associated quality of life. Techniques to reduce leak rates are therefore highly sought.

Method

A literature search was performed for published full text articles using PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases with a focus on colorectal surgery 1990–2020. Additional papers were detected by scanning references of relevant papers.

Results

A total of 53 papers were included after a thorough literature search. Techniques assessed included leak tests, endoscopy, perfusion assessment and fluorescence studies. Air-leak testing remains the most commonly used method across Europe, due to ease of reproducibility and low cost. There is no evidence that this reduces the leak rate; however, identification of a leak intra-operatively provides the opportunity for either suture reinforcement or formal takedown with or without re-do of the anastomosis and consideration of diversion. Suture repair alone of a positive air-leak test is associated with an increased AL rate. The use of fluorescence studies to guide the site of anastomosis has demonstrated reduced leak rates in distal anastomoses, is safe, feasible and has a promising future.

Conclusion

Although over reliance on any assessment tool should be avoided, intra-operative techniques with the aim of reducing AL rates are increasingly being employed. Standardization of these methods is imperative for routine use. However, in the interim it is recommended that all anastomoses should be assessed intra-operatively for mechanical failure, particularly distal anastomoses.

### Impact of anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery on quality of life: a systematic review [^111ossUP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the effects of AL on QoL in patients undergoing oncological colon and rectal resections. This study has limitations. First, a high heterogeneity in AL reporting was found in the included articles. It was often unclear what type of intervention and reoperation was performed to manage leaks. Because these elements are important when comparing outcomes, standardizing the reporting and management of leaks would be helpful. Subsequently, some studies only included patients with rectal cancer, whereas others included all types of colorectal surgeries. Second, a wide range of QoL questionnaires and time frames for assessment was used across the different studies. Although only studies using validated instruments were included, the heterogeneity of questionnaires created challenges when comparing outcomes across studies and interpreting results. The use of patient-centered methods, such as patient-reported outcome measures, may be even more informative to gain more insight into overall changes. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, comparisons across studies are limited and a meta-analysis was not possible to perform. Finally, all included studies demonstrated a moderate to serious risk of bias, which results in a low level of evidence, and caution is warranted by the presented findings.

### Postoperative ileus following major colorectal surgery [^116Bf5NY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus (POI) is characterized by delayed gastrointestinal recovery following surgery. Current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical interventions and methodological challenges was reviewed to inform modern practice and future research.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed using search terms related to ileus and colorectal surgery. All RCTs involving an intervention to prevent or reduce POI published between 1990 and 2016 were identified. Grey literature, non-full-text manuscripts, and reanalyses of previous RCTs were excluded. Eligible articles were assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias.

Results

Of 5614 studies screened, 86 eligible articles describing 88 RCTs were identified. Current knowledge of pathophysiology acknowledges neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms, but much of the evidence arises from animal studies. The most common interventions tested were chewing gum (11 trials) and early enteral feeding (11), which are safe but of unclear benefit for actively reducing POI. Others, including thoracic epidural analgesia (8), systemic lidocaine (8) and peripheral μ antagonists (5), show benefit but require further investigation for safety and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

POI is a common condition with no established definition, aetiology or treatment. According to current literature, minimally invasive surgery, protocol-driven recovery (including early feeding and opioid avoidance strategies) and measures to avoid major inflammatory events (such as anastomotic leak) offer the best chances of reducing POI.

### Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery [^11418P3j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For over a century the presence of bowel content during surgery has been linked to anastomotic leakage. Mechanical bowel preparation has been considered an efficient agent against leakage and infectious complications. This dogma is not based on solid evidence, but on observational data and expert's opinions.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic mechanical bowel preparation for morbidity and mortality rates in elective colorectal surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We also searched relevant medical journals, and conference proceedings from major gastroenterological congresses and contacted experts in the field. We used the search strategy described by the Colorectal Cancer Review Group, without limitations for date of publication and language. I SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, clinical trials that compared any strategy in mechanical bowel preparation with no mechanical bowel preparation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by the reviewers and cross-checked. The same reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial. Details of the randomisation (generation and concealment), blinding, whether an intention-to-treat analysis was done, and the number of patients lost to follow-up was recorded. For analysis the Peto odds ratio (OR) was used as defaults.

Main Results

Of the 1592 patients (9 trials), 789 were allocated to mechanical bowel preparation (Group A) and 803 to no preparation (Group B) before elective colorectal surgery. For anastomotic leakage (main outcome) the results were: - Low anterior resection: 9.8% (11 of 112 patients in Group A) compared with 7.5% (9 of 119 patients in Group B); Peto OR 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57 to 3.67 (non-significant); - Colonic surgery: 2.9% (Group A) compared with 1.6% (Group B); Peto OR 1.80, 95% CI: 0.68 to 4.75 (non-significant); Overall anastomotic leakage: 6.2% (Group A) compared with 3.2% (Group B); Peto OR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.276 to 3.26 (p = 0.003). For the secondary outcome of wound infection the result was: 7.4% (Group A) compared with 5.4% (Group B); Peto OR 1.46, 95% CI: 0.97 - to 2.18 (p = 0.07); Sensitivity analyses excluding studies with dubious randomisation, studies published as abstracts only, and studies involving children did not change the overall conclusions

Authors' Conclusions

There is no convincing evidence that mechanical bowel preparation is associated with reduced rates of anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. On the contrary, there is evidence that this intervention may be associated with an increased rate of anastomotic leakage and wound complications. It is not possible to be conclusion on the latter issue because of the clinical heterogeneity of trial inclusion criteria, methodological inadequacies in trial (in particular, poor reporting of concealment and allocation), potential performance biases, and failure of intention-to-treat analyses. Nevertheless, the dogma that mechanical bowel preparation is necessary before elective colorectal surgery should be reconsidered.

### Evaluation of a quality improvement intervention to reduce anastomotic leak following right colectomy (EAGLE): pragmatic, batched stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial in 64 countries [^115ko9a4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The study was registered at(NCT04270721) and the protocol has been published. As the intervention comprised training delivered at a hospital-level, Health Research Authority (HRA) approval was obtained for research not requiring patient-level consent in the UK (REC reference:19/HRA/5656). This was also the case for the large majority of hospitals, internationally. Where ethical approval was required, the national PI was responsible for obtaining this before the hospital was ready for entry into randomization. Consent was obtained for surgery as part of routine care and consent to research was not required in most countries, as the intervention was implemented at hospital level and the primary outcome derived from routinely collected patient outcomes.

Hospital eligibility, team structure

EAGLE was designed to be globally inclusive, enrolling any surgical unit that performed right colectomy regardless of hospital size or annual case volume (Table S1). Registration required identification of surgical, anaesthetic, and nursing PIs.

Patients and data collection

Consecutive patients, aged 18 years and over, undergoing right colectomy (including ileocaecal resection) for any indication or urgency were included in the study, whether or not an anastomosis and/or stoma was formed. Excluded were patients undergoing more than one anastomosis, those having additional synchronous procedures, and those undergoing a second eligible operation in the data collection window. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Appendix S3. Routine patient data were collected from hospital notes and reported electronically via the Research Electronic Data Capture web application (REDCap; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA), hosted in the University of Birmingham, UK.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was anastomotic leak in patients who had a primary anastomosis, within 30 days of surgery (operation day was day 0). The study used the ESCP consensus definition of 'leak or intraperitoneal (abdominal or pelvic) fluid collection identified radiologically or clinically'. Follow-up was for 30 days after surgery. Routinely collected patient data were retrieved from medical notes, electronic health records or routine in-person assessments by the local team.

Secondary clinical outcomes were assessed at 30 days after operation, and included clinical leaks, reoperation for anastomotic leak, readmission to hospital, reoperation for any reason, unplanned admission to critical care, duration of hospital stay (10 or fewer versus more than 10 days), stoma formation (stoma without primary anastomosis and defunctioning ileostomy), and death.

### Evaluation of a quality improvement intervention to reduce anastomotic leak following right colectomy (EAGLE): pragmatic, batched stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial in 64 countries [^1175kTEy]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leak affects 8 per cent of patients after right colectomy with a 10-fold increased risk of postoperative death. The EAGLE study aimed to develop and test whether an international, standardized quality improvement intervention could reduce anastomotic leaks.

Methods

The internationally intended protocol, iteratively co-developed by a multistage Delphi process, comprised an online educational module introducing risk stratification, an intraoperative checklist, and harmonized surgical techniques. Clusters (hospital teams) were randomized to one of three arms with varied sequences of intervention/data collection by a derived stepped-wedge batch design (at least 18 hospital teams per batch). Patients were blinded to the study allocation. Low- and middle-income country enrolment was encouraged. The primary outcome (assessed by intention to treat) was anastomotic leak rate, and subgroup analyses by module completion (at least 80 per cent of surgeons, high engagement; less than 50 per cent, low engagement) were preplanned.

Results

A total 355 hospital teams registered, with 332 from 64 countries (39.2 per cent low and middle income) included in the final analysis. The online modules were completed by half of the surgeons (2143 of 4411). The primary analysis included 3039 of the 3268 patients recruited (206 patients had no anastomosis and 23 were lost to follow-up), with anastomotic leaks arising before and after the intervention in 10.1 and 9.6 per cent respectively (adjusted OR 0.87, 95 per cent c.i. 0.59 to 1.30; P = 0.498). The proportion of surgeons completing the educational modules was an influence: the leak rate decreased from 12.2 per cent (61 of 500) before intervention to 5.1 per cent (24 of 473) after intervention in high-engagement centres (adjusted OR 0.36, 0.20 to 0.64; P < 0.001), but this was not observed in low-engagement hospitals (8.3 per cent (59 of 714) and 13.8 per cent (61 of 443) respectively; adjusted OR 2.09, 1.31 to 3.31).

Conclusion

Completion of globally available digital training by engaged teams can alter anastomotic leak rates. Registration number: NCT04270721 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

### Score prediction of anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review [^1144YL8X]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Anastomotic leak (AL) is a dreaded complication in colorectal surgery. In the 2018 European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) audit, AL was clinically or radiologically proven in 7.3% of patients who had an anastomosis in the left colon, sigmoid or rectum. In another recent retrospective study, Rencuzogullari et al. reported an incidence of AL of 3.2% in 10.392 patients who underwent elective colectomy and/or anterior resection. More specifically, in rectal surgery, the incidence of AL reached 24.7% in the randomized controlled GRECCAR 5 trial.

AL has serious consequences on perioperative morbidity and mortality, and on long-term survival after oncologic surgery. For instance, AL is associated with increased incidence of local recurrence and reduced long-term and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Moreover, the economic burden caused by AL significantly impairs healthcare systems budgets. In a retrospective study including 600 hospitals in the United States, Hammond et al. reported that AL led to an increase of the economic burden by a factor ranging between 0.6 and 1.9 for 30-day re-admission, postoperative infection, length of stay and hospital costs. Moreover, several prophylactic measures are routinely taken to reduce the clinical impact of potential AL in patients with anastomoses at higher risk of AL. These measures may increase the morbidity of colorectal surgery as well as impairing patient's quality of life. For instance, subperitoneal colorectal anastomoses after low anterior resection are routinely diverted with a temporary defunctioning loop ileostomy, which leads to an increased risk of rehospitalization for dehydration due to acute renal failure caused by high ileostomy output, alteration of quality of life, troubles with stoma management and costs associated with a second surgery to close the ileostomy.

To decrease the incidence of AL, attempts have been made to identify pre-operative risk factors for AL. Among measures targeting controllable risk factors, we can mention the use of fluorescence angiography, mechanical bowel preparation, preoperative antibiotics, preoperative iron and specific perioperative program like the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS).

In order to reduce the risk of AL, identify patients at risk of AL and help in the surgical decision-making, several scores allowing to predict the risk of AL have been developed over the years. As their ability to predict AL has not been compared in the recent literature, our objective was to perform a systematic review of existing scores and to identify important factors that could predict AL in colorectal surgery.

### Standardized algorithms for management of anastomotic leaks and related abdominal and pelvic abscesses after colorectal surgery [^1139vF2w]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The risk factors and incidence of anastomotic leak following colorectal surgery are well reported in the literature. However, the management of the multiple clinical scenarios that may be encountered has not been standardized.

Methods

The medical literature from 1973 to 2007 was reviewed using PubMed for papers relating to anastomotic leaks and abdominal abscess, with a specific emphasis on predisposing factors, prevention strategies, and treatment approaches. A six-round modified Delphi research method was utilized to find consensus among a group of expert colorectal surgeons and interventional radiologists regarding standardized management algorithms for anastomotic leaks.

Results

Management scenarios were divided into those for intraperitoneal anastomoses, extraperitoneal (low pelvic) anastomoses, and anastomoses with proximal diverting stomas. Management options were then based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings and organized into three interconnected algorithms.

Conclusions

This process was a useful first step toward establishing guidelines for the management of anastomotic leak.

### Changes in clinical practice reduce the rate of anastomotic leakage after colorectal resections [^113P6tfn]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study shows that the anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resections with a primary anastomosis decreased from 10.0 to 4.5% after implementing a structured change in clinical practice including exclusion of perioperative NSAIDs, introduction of intra-operative goal-directed fluid therapy and avoidance of primary anastomoses in acute resections. However, the present study design cannot determine to what extent each component contributed to the reduction in anastomotic leakage rate.

Avoiding colorectal anastomoses in emergency procedures may prevent anastomotic leakage since emergency resection with primary anastomosis has been identified as an independent risk factor for anastomotic leakage. The proportion of emergency resections was small in the present study which may explain why this effect was not detected, as analysis restricted to elective procedures showed similar findings as for the entire study population. Previous studies suggest that omission of perioperative NSAIDs and optimizing intra-operative fluid balance are factors that may reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage. Intra-operative fluid and sodium overload has been associated with increased hospital stay and complication rate, but can be prevented by restricted fluid therapy regimens. Also hypovolemia may increase complications. Different methods for goal-directed fluid therapy in order to obtain better fluid balance have been described and seem to improve postoperative outcomes in terms of shorter length of stay and reduced complication rates, and has been recommended as part of ERPs. Esophageal Doppler for intra-operative stroke volume optimization was introduced at our unit for colorectal surgery and may allow for better hemodynamic control, especially during longer and more complex surgery. The combined effect of the factors above appeared to have an effect in the present study and can be adopted at relatively low costs. In contrast, the cost of grade III complications after colorectal operations has been estimated to a mean of more than 50,000 US Dollars. Our results are in agreement with a recent smaller study that reported a reduction in anastomotic leakage rate from 9.8 to 4.2% after implementation of a very similar quality improvement program.

### Mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotics reduces surgical site infection and anastomotic leak rates in elective colorectal cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112fU1oa]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) and anastomotic leak (AL) are major contributors to postoperative morbidity in elective colorectal surgery. Although the addition of oral antibiotics (oAB) to mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is recommended by several professional societies, uncertainty remains about its effectiveness and hence uptake globally is inconsistent, particularly in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD420251055720) of randomised controlled trials comparing MBP plus oAB with MBP alone in adult patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer resection. The primary outcomes were overall SSI. Secondary outcomes included CDC-defined SSI subtypes, AL and Clostridium difficile infection. A prespecified subgroup analysis was performed for trials limited to rectal cancer resections. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2.0 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated with GRADE methodology.

Results

Nine trials comprising 3046 patients with colorectal cancer met inclusion criteria. Compared with MBP alone, the addition of oAB significantly reduced the risk of SSI (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.44–0.68; I² = 8%; p < 0.001) and AL (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32–0.65; I² = 0%; p < 0.001). This benefit persisted across CDC-defined superficial incisional (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34–0.82; p = 0.005), deep incisional (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22–0.71; p = 0.002) and organ/space infections (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.39–0.78; p < 0.001). In rectal cancer patients (n = 1172), the pooled risk of SSI remained lower with MBP plus oAB (RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29–0.79; I² = 41%; p = 0.004) and AL (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25–0.65; I² = 0%; p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. The certainty of evidence was rated as moderate to high for all primary outcomes.

Conclusions

The addition of oral antibiotics to mechanical bowel preparation significantly reduces the risk of SSI and anastomotic leak in elective colorectal cancer surgery. The benefits are consistent in rectal cancer-specific cohorts, supporting the integration of oral antibiotics into standard bowel preparation protocols for patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection.

### Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery [^111GriGX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of bowel contents during surgery has been related to anastomotic leakage, but the belief that mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is an efficient agent against leakage and infectious complications is based on observational data and expert opinions only.

Objectives

To determine the security and effectiveness of MBP on morbidity and mortality in colorectal surgery.

Search Strategy

Publications describing trials of MBP before elective colorectal surgery were sought through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and The Cochrane Library; by handsearching relevant medical journals and conference proceedings, and through personal communication with colleagues. Searches were performed March 13, 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including participants submitted for elective colorectal surgery. Eligible interventions included any type of MBP compared with no MBP. Primary outcomes included anastomosis leakage - both rectal and colonic - and combined figures. Secondary outcomes included mortality, peritonitis, reoperation, wound infection, extra-abdominal complications, and overall surgical site infections.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted and checked. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed. Details of randomisation, blinding, type of analysis, and number lost to follow up were recorded. For analysis, the Peto-Odds Ratio (OR) was used as the default (no statistical heterogeneity was observed).

Main Results

Four new trials were included at this update (total 13 RCTs with 4777 participants; 2390 allocated to MBP (Group A), and 2387 to no preparation (Group B), before elective colorectal surgery). Anastomotic leakage occurred:(i) in 10.0% (14/139) of Group A, compared with 6.6% (9/136) of Group B for low anterior resection; Peto OR 1.73 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 4.10).(ii) in 2.9% (32/1226) of Group A, compared with 2.5% (31/1228) of Group B for colonic surgery; Peto OR 1.13 (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.85). Overall anastomotic leakage occurred in 4.2% (102/2398) of Group A, compared with 3.4% (82/2378) of Group B; Peto OR 1.26 (95% CI: 0.941 to 1.69). Wound infection occurred in 9.6% (232/2417) of Group A, compared with 8.3% (200/2404) of Group B; Peto OR 1.19 (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.45). Sensitivity analyses did not produce any differences in overall results.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no statistically significant evidence that patients benefit from MBP. The belief that MBP is necessary before elective colorectal surgery should be reconsidered. Further research on patients submitted for elective colorectal surgery in whom bowel continuity is restored, with stratification for colonic and rectal surgery, is still warranted.

### Score prediction of anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review [^112LHZD8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Predicting the risk of anastomotic leak (AL) is of importance when defining the optimal surgical strategy in colorectal surgery. Our objective was to perform a systematic review of existing scores in the field.

Methods

We followed the PRISMA checklist (S1 Checklist). Medline, Cochrane Central and Embase were searched for observational studies reporting on scores predicting AL after the creation of a colorectal anastomosis. Studies reporting only validation of existing scores and/or scores based on post-operative variables were excluded. PRISMA 2020 recommendations were followed. Qualitative analysis was performed.

Results

Eight hundred articles were identified. Seven hundred and ninety-one articles were excluded after title/abstract and full-text screening, leaving nine studies for analysis. Scores notably included the Colon Leakage Score, the modified Colon Leakage Score, the REAL score, www.anastomoticleak.com and the PROCOLE score. Four studies (44.4%) included more than 1.000 patients and one extracted data from existing studies (meta-analysis of risk factors). Scores included the following pre-operative variables: age (44.4%), sex (77.8%), ASA score (66.6%), BMI (33.3%), diabetes (22.2%), respiratory comorbidity (22.2%), cardiovascular comorbidity (11.1%), liver comorbidity (11.1%), weight loss (11.1%), smoking (33.3%), alcohol consumption (33.3%), steroid consumption (33.3%), neo-adjuvant treatment (44.9%), anticoagulation (11.1%), hematocrit concentration (22.2%), total proteins concentration (11.1%), white blood cell count (11.1%), albumin concentration (11.1%), distance from the anal verge (77.8%), number of hospital beds (11.1%), pre-operative bowel preparation (11.1%) and indication for surgery (11.1%). Scores included the following peri-operative variables: emergency surgery (22.2%), surgical approach (22.2%), duration of surgery (66.6%), blood loss/transfusion (55.6%), additional procedure (33.3%), operative complication (22.2%), wound contamination class (1.11%), mechanical anastomosis (1.11%) and experience of the surgeon (11.1%). Five studies (55.6%) reported the area under the curve (AUC) of the scores, and four (44.4%) included a validation set.

Conclusion

Existing scores are heterogeneous in the identification of pre-operative variables allowing predicting AL. A majority of scores was established from small cohorts of patients which, considering the low incidence of AL, might lead to miss potential predictors of AL. AUC is seldom reported. We recommend that new scores to predict the risk of AL in colorectal surgery to be based on large cohorts of patients, to include a validation set and to report the AUC.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for ostomy surgery [^113jYbK9]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to ostomy surgery (ostomy closure), ASCRS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing early closure of protective ileostomies in selected low-risk patients with colorectal anastomosis without clinical evidence of anastomotic leak.

### International consensus on reporting anastomotic leaks after colorectal cancer surgery: the CoReAL reporting framework [^113kgpeC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, institutions have only been required to report the 30-day leak, reintervention, reoperation, and readmission rates, which have been used as colectomy-specific quality benchmarking. This requirement has reinforced the stigma associated with the reporting of AL and deterred clinical teams from interrogating anastomoses early, particularly when subclinical leaks are suspected. Another shortcoming of traditional quality reporting is that it does not consider whether steps were taken to mitigate the risk of leaks and to identify and manage them early, effectively shortening the time to resolution. Extending the reporting period beyond 90 days is also critical to document resolution of AL, assess the true impact on health care resource utilization, and capture oncologic and functional sequelae, which are often omitted in shorter follow-up periods. The proposed extended reporting time frame for AL, which reached consensus among experts, was aligned with patients' feedback regarding the need for better support for patients affected by long-term sequelae of AL.

The widespread adoption of the CoReAL framework holds the potential to standardize and destigmatize the reporting of AL. By providing a clear and consistent methodology, the framework can enhance the quality of AL-related research and clinical care. This standardization will help ensure that data collected across different studies and clinical settings are comparable and reliable, facilitating better comparison of trials and meta-analyses. In addition, standardized reporting can help demystify AL for patients, providing them with clearer information regarding their prognosis and the long-term impact of their condition. The framework could also serve as a model for clinical trials using AL as a clinical end point and for benchmarking surgical outcomes and postoperative complications at the institutional level.

It is important to highlight that the CoReAL framework is not intended to replace prior AL guidelines but provides a high-quality, evidence-based, expert-informed, and patient-centered reporting framework. Although existing guidelines may recommend elements that are included in our framework, these recommendations are not always systematically implemented or reported. This consensus project may address the gap between guideline recommendations and real-world implementation.

### Association of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics before elective colorectal surgery with surgical site infection: a network meta-analysis [^1123znzS]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which approach is best to reduce surgical site infections and anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, oral antibiotics only, mechanical bowel preparation only, or no preparation?

Findings

Among 38 randomized clinical trials (8458 patients) in this network meta-analysis, mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics was associated with the lowest rate of surgical site infections, reducing both incisional and organ/space infections. There was no significant difference in anastomotic leak rate between the 4 approaches.

Meaning

Mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is the best approach to reduce surgical site infections in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

### What is the optimal management of an intra-operative air leak in a colorectal anastomosis? [^116D5GbA]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

An airtight anastomosis on intra-operative leak testing has been previously demonstrated to be associated with a lower risk of clinically significant postoperative anastomotic leak following left-sided colorectal anastomosis. However, to date, there is no consistently agreed upon method for management of an intra-operative anastomotic leak. Therefore, we powered a noninferiority study to determine whether suture repair alone was an appropriate strategy for the management of an intra-operative air leak.

Method

This is a retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data from a tertiary care referral centre. We included all consecutive patients with left-sided colorectal or ileorectal anastomoses and evidence of air leak during intra-operative leak testing. Patients were excluded if proximal diversion was planned preoperatively, a pre-existing proximal diversion was present at the time of surgery or an anastomosis was ultimately unable to be completed. The primary outcome measure was clinically significant anastomotic leak, as defined by the Surgical Infection Study Group at 30 days.

Results

From a sample of 2360 patients, 119 had an intra-operative air leak during leak testing. Sixty-eight patients underwent suture repair alone and 51 underwent proximal diversion or anastomotic reconstruction. The clinically significant leak rate was 9% (6/68; 95% CI: 2–15%) in the suture repair alone arm and 0% (0/51) in the diversion or reconstruction arm.

Conclusion

Suture repair alone does not meet the criteria for noninferiority for the management of intra-operative air leak during left-sided colorectal anastomosis. Further repair of intra-operative air leak by suture repair alone should be reconsidered given these findings.

### ICG-FA for anastomotic leak prevention during minimally invasive colorectal surgery: a meta-analysis [^115EYc8P]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication after colorectal surgery. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) allows real-time perfusion assessment and may reduce leak rates; however, recent larger randomized clinical trials reported conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effectiveness of ICG-FA in reducing anastomotic leakage and related complications following minimally invasive colorectal surgery.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search across the databases to identify relevant studies. The search results were imported into Covidence for article eligibility screening, and all relevant outcomes data were synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in meta-analysis models using RevMan 5.4. CRD420251031138.

Results

Six randomized clinical trials involving 3264 participants were included. ICG-FA significantly reduced the risk of overall anastomotic leakage (RR: 0.66, 95% CI [0.53–0.83], P = 0.0005) and complications (RR: 0.88, 95% CI [0.78–0.99], P = 0.03). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in leakage for left-sided anastomoses (RR: 0.57, 95% CI [0.44–0.75], P < 0.0001) but not for right-sided ones (RR: 0.90, 95% CI [0.53–1.51], P = 0.68). No significant differences were found in Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 complications, reoperation rates, or hospital stay. However, the ICG-FA group had a longer operation time (mean difference: 5.57, 95% CI [1.56–9.58], P = 0.006).

Conclusions

ICG-FA significantly reduces anastomotic leakage and overall complications in minimally invasive colorectal surgery, especially for left-sided anastomoses. However, its use is associated with a slightly longer operative time. Further research is needed to confirm its role in right-sided procedures and long-term outcomes.

Ileus Prevention

21. Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (ie, within 24 hours of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower GI surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean LOS in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### The impact of powered circular staplers on anastomotic leak in left-sided colorectal cancer surgeries [^111pApa9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The study suggests that adopting powered circular staplers may not substantially reduce leakage rates or overall complications compared to manual staplers in colorectal surgery. Our institution consistently observed similar leakage rates regardless of stapler types, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach to secure anastomosis. This emphasizes the need to consider multiple factors beyond the type of a surgical stapler when assessing postoperative outcomes in colorectal surgery.

### International consensus on reporting anastomotic leaks after colorectal cancer surgery: the CoReAL reporting framework [^112GeKoF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction and Evidence-Based Statements

Data extraction was conducted using RevMan Web (Review Manager Web, Computer program, version 4.12.0. The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022). General information regarding oncologic colorectal AL, including definitions, severity assessment, diagnostic time frame, clinical symptoms, biochemical tests, imaging modalities, type of reinterventions, and long-term outcomes, was collected using standardized forms. Key outcome measures related to AL (eg, relative risk, OR, HR) were extracted for every research question. If systematic reviews showed overlapping data, the lowest quality study was excluded, or a new overview was created, which only included mutually exclusive studies. If no overlap was found, data were pooled using RevMan Web tools. Methodological quality and risk of bias for included studies were assessed by 2 research collaborators using the RoB2 tool for randomized controlled trials and the ROBIS tool for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Bias was visualized with a risk-of-bias visualization tool in RevMan Web.

After summarizing and presenting all the evidence related to each question, evidence-based statements were formulated by each WG to address all AL-related questions. The formulation of the statements was based on the level of evidence (LoE) according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines, rated as "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". Standardized wording used to phrase statements is shown in Table 1. When the LoE was very low, the research team did not formulate a statement but flagged the topic as lacking evidence.

TABLE 1.
Phrasing of the statements based on the LoE

Consensus on Drafted Statements

A 2-phase modified Delphi method, consisting of an online survey and an in-person consensus meeting, was used to achieve consensus on all evidence-based statements. In the first phase, the statements from each WG with LoE were presented to all 32 team experts who subsequently voted online on each of these statements using a 9-point Likert scale, with consensus defined as more than 70% agreement (a score of 7 or more on the Likert scale). In the second phase, statements that did not reach consensus were discussed on day 1 of a 2-day in-person consensus meeting held in Boston in October 2023. Research collaborators presented the data analysis for all statements that did not reach consensus and facilitated discussions and rephrasing of the statements among experts. Another round of voting was performed, with consensus achieved with more than 70% agreement.

### Comment on: intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment methods and their effects on anastomotic leak rates: meta-analysis [^1138ptFH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

The meta-analysis on intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment methods and their effects on anastomotic leak ratesmakes a significant contribution to the surgical literature by synthesizing results from various studies to assess the role of intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment technologies in reducing anastomotic leaks in colorectal surgery. Nevertheless, we raise a few questions that need further exploration. First, the study fails to specify the sample size, study design, or quality of the individual studies, raising concerns about the robustness and applicability of the findings. A more in-depth analysis including a forest plot and funnel plot would provide a clearer perspective on the heterogeneity and risk of bias among the included studies. Second, the analysis does not take into account the operator dependency of these assessment methods. The results from these technologies largely depend on the skill and experience of the surgeon or the staff operating them. It would be interesting to explore how much of the reported reduction in anastomotic leak is attributable to the technology itself versus the surgical experience and skill. Furthermore, the study does not address the cost-effectiveness of these assessment technologies. Incorporating a cost analysis could provide a comprehensive overview to help healthcare institutions in their decision-making processes regarding the adoption of these technologies. Lastly, the study does not delve into how these technologies are used to alter surgical decision-making and how these alterations affect outcomes. It would be beneficial to explore how often these technologies change the surgical plan and how this translates into patient outcomes. In summary, although this meta-analysis represents a valuable step forward in understanding the role of perfusion assessment technologies, addressing the above areas could lend further credence to their efficacy and utility.

### Fluorescence angiography likely protects against anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114qYEET]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Observational studies have shown that fluorescence angiography (FA) decreases the incidence of anastomotic leak (AL) in colorectal surgery, but high-quality pooled evidence was lacking. Therefore, we aimed at confirming this preliminary finding using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the field.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched for RCTs assessing the effect of intra-operative FA versus standard assessment of bowel perfusion on the incidence of AL of colorectal anastomosis. The systematic review complied with the PRISMA 2020 and AMSTAR2 recommendations and was registered in PROSPERO. Pooled relative risk (RR) and pooled risk difference (RD) were obtained using models with random effects. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-test and quantified using the I 2 value. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE Pro tool.

Results

One hundred and eleven articles were screened, 108 were excluded and three were kept for inclusion. The three included RCTs compared assessment of the perfusion of the bowel during creation of a colorectal anastomosis using FA versus standard practice. In meta-analysis, FA was significantly protective against AL (3 RCTs, 964 patients, RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.99, I 2: 0%, p = 0.04). The RD of AL was non-significantly decreased by 4 percentage points (95%CI: - 0.08 to 0, I 2: 8%, p = 0.06) when using FA. Certainty of evidence was considered as moderate.

Conclusion

The effect of FA on prevention of AL in colorectal surgery exists but is potentially of small magnitude. Considering the potential magnitude of effect of FA, we advise that future RCTs have an adequate sample size, include a cost-benefit analysis of the technique and better define the subpopulation who could benefit from FA.

### Modulating gut microbiota prevents anastomotic leak to reduce local implantation and dissemination of colorectal cancer cells after surgery [^115a2Lyz]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Anastomotic leak (AL) is a major complication in colorectal cancer surgery and consists of the leakage of intestinal content through a poorly healed colonic wound. Colorectal cancer recurrence after surgery is a major determinant of survival. We hypothesize that AL may allow cancer cells to escape the gut and lead to cancer recurrence and that improving anastomotic healing may prevent local implantation and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells.

Experimental Design

We investigated the association between AL and postoperative outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. Using mouse models of poor anastomotic healing, we assessed the processes of local implantation and dissemination of cancer cells. The effect of dietary supplementation with inulin and 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), which activate PPAR-γ in the gut, on local anastomotic tumors was assessed in mice undergoing colonic surgery. Inulin and 5-ASA were also assessed in a mouse model of liver metastasis.

Results

Patients experiencing AL displayed lower overall and oncologic survival than non-AL patients. Poor anastomotic healing in mice led to larger anastomotic and peritoneal tumors. The microbiota of patients with AL displays a lower capacity to activate the antineoplastic PPAR-γ in the gut. Modulation of gut microbiota using dietary inulin and 5-ASA reinforced the gut barrier and prevented anastomotic tumors and metastatic spread in mice.

Conclusions

Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that preventing AL is paramount to improving oncologic outcomes after colorectal cancer surgery. Furthermore, they pave the way toward dietary targeting of PPAR-γ as a novel way to enhance healing and diminish cancer recurrence.

### Extracellular matrix hydrogel reduces anastomotic leaks in a rodent model of rectal anastomosis [^114FhC13]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anastomotic leaks remain a significant source of morbidity following rectal resections. Despite advances in technique, the incidence of leaks remains high, often necessitating temporary fecal diversion which carries its own risks and requires additional surgery for restoration of intestinal continuity. Reducing leak rates could minimize the need for prophylactic diversion. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-based surgical devices have shown potential to support gastrointestinal healing. Urinary bladder matrix (UBM), a versatile, acellular ECM material that promotes constructive tissue remodeling, has not been extensively studied in colorectal anastomoses. A lack of reliable small animal models has limited progress in this field.

Methods

A reproducible rat model of low rectal anastomosis was developed to evaluate ECM-based interventions. Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent standardized distal colonic resection and sutured anastomosis below the peritoneal reflection. Rats were randomized to receive no adjunct, UBM extraluminal wraps, or UBM hydrogel applied directly to the anastomosis. Healing was assessed using a multimodal evaluation strategy.

Results

Control animals demonstrated a 46% anastomotic leak rate, while UBM hydrogel treatment significantly reduced leak rates to 8%. Extraluminal wraps did not confer a protective effect. Rats treated with hydrogel also exhibited fewer perianastomotic adhesions. Histological analysis showed improved composite healing scores in the hydrogel group.

Conclusions

This reliable small animal model provides a valuable platform for testing surgical adjuncts. UBM hydrogel shows promise in reducing rectal anastomotic leak rates through both mechanical support and biochemical modulation of healing. This model enables further investigation into anastomotic healing mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.

### Quality of reporting on anastomotic leaks in colorectal cancer trials: a systematic review [^1129rGXr]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

The stigma associated with leaks and the use of institutional AL rates as a measure of surgical quality may contribute to the generalized reluctance to investigate leaks early and consistently, as reflected in the wide range of reported diagnostic elements in our review. This stigma must be balanced against the potential benefits of adopting a standardized reporting framework that facilitates earlier diagnosis, management, and resolution of leaks. Also, within current reporting systems like the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, the reporting of an AL is presently contingent on the specific intervention undertaken and lacks background information (this encompasses a spectrum of scenarios: instances where no documented treatment intervention is recorded, cases managed through interventional methods, situations addressed with noninterventional or nonoperative approaches, instances necessitating reoperation, situations where there is no definitive diagnosis of a leak or a leak-related abscess, and cases categorized as unknown). The need for standardized, well-accepted terminology for reporting AL remains an important issue, especially when evaluating the effectiveness of targeted interventions and/or comparing procedural outcomes. Several issues need to be addressed before formulating a novel framework for reporting and grading colorectal AL that will gain wide acceptance. A consensus agreement needs to be reached with respect to which clinical, radiologic or endoscopic, and/or biochemical elements are most suggestive of AL, as reporting rates of these elements vary widely. Second, agreement is also needed with respect to grading the severity of leaks, which may take into account not only the type of intervention(s) required but also short- and long-term sequelae and impact on patients. Third, additional elements relevant to the time frame of diagnosis and management of leaks should be routinely incorporated in reporting, with a clear distinction between early versus late/delayed AL diagnosis. Finally, additional features of AL, with potential implications on outcomes and interventions, may need to be included, such as anastomotic height and protective fecal diversion.

### Intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment methods and their effects on anastomotic leak rates: meta-analysis [^1168AY8x]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis found that assessment of bowel perfusion before the formation of a colorectal anastomosis reduced the incidence of anastomotic leak. ICG-FA, DRS, LSCI, and HSI all reduced the risk of anastomotic leak occurring for the included populations.

This comprehensive review compared four methods of bowel perfusion assessment. The major limitation of the study pertained to the limited number of studies and case populations in all groups other than ICG-FA, meaning that studies describing other imaging modalities were potentially underpowered. With ICG-FA accounting for 78.2 per cent of all cases, the total anastomotic leak rate is likely to be skewed more towards the mean for ICG-FA, rather than the true mean across all studies. Additionally, MINORS scores for the included studies were low for blinding and study sizes. This is likely to have influenced the results in favour of the interventions investigated. Owing to the heterogeneity of the results, it was decided to rely on results obtained from random-effects model methodology as it incorporates more realistic assumptions about heterogeneity of effects across studies. The data sets from the DRS and ICG-FA groups demonstrated the most heterogeneity. Factors increasing study heterogeneity included different study methodologies, definitions of anastomotic leak, surgical techniques, and device use. Studies investigating HSI and LSCI had lower heterogeneity as they were trials of similar origin.

The current literature is conflicting regarding the efficacy of ICG-FA. Similar to other work, based on the present review, the authors propose that ICG-FA has a role in reducing the risk of anastomotic leak when deployed during operation for lower gastrointestinal cancers. However, some of the larger case–control studies evaluating ICG-FA drew contrasting conclusions; some, suggested a trend towards reduced anastomotic leak rates with the use of ICG-FA, whereas others, demonstrated that ICG-FA could significantly reduce leakage rates. Of note, there are also a number of ongoing studies assessing the benefits of ICG-FA in reducing anastomotic leak rates in colorectal cancers, including EssentiAL, IntAct, and AVOID.

The total random-effects results demonstrated that DRS was not as effective as HSI, LSCI, and ICG-FA in reducing the risk of anastomotic leak. This is also supported by the differences between DRS and the other imaging modalities in omnibus testing. A potential reason for this is that DRS looks at a very small area of tissue oxygenation and so lacks the overall picture that ICG-FA, HSI or LSCI may provide; further research to test this hypothesis is recommended.

### Evaluation of a quality improvement intervention to reduce anastomotic leak following right colectomy (EAGLE): pragmatic, batched stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial in 64 countries [^112oBqjZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Sample size and adjustments

The original sample size was calculated based on published evidence from ESCP audit data (2015), with mean recruitment of 10 patients per 8-week recruitment phase, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of approximately 0.05; full details are available in the protocol. Detection of a 30 per cent reduction in anastomotic leak from 8.1 to 5.6 per cent, was calculated to require 333 hospital teams and 4440 patients. A priori trial planning allowed sample size adjustments after the first look. Interim, blinded results from the first eight completed batches were presented to the Data Monitoring Committee, and subsequently to the Trial Steering Committee, showing that the leak rate aggregated across intervention and control arms was 9.0 per cent. For this aggregated leak rate of 9.0 per cent, the predicted difference in leak rate wound need to fall from 10.6 per cent in the control to 7.4 per cent in the intervention arm to represent a 30 per cent reduction in leak. The number of procedures observed in each data collection phase in each hospital averaged around 8, which was smaller than the figure of 10 assumed in the original sample size calculation. Following the a priori plan, sample size reassessment based on these figures produced a new minimum target sample size of 312 clusters and 3328 participants. Owing to the lower than anticipated patient recruitment per site, the Trial Steering Committee recommended that the original cluster target of 333 hospital teams should stand.

Randomization

When a batch of clusters was ready for randomization, the central team matched hospital teams into triplets that were matched according to: World Bank country income classification (low, lower middle, upper middle or high income; see Appendix S3 for definitions); tertiary referral status (whether their hospital accepts referrals from other hospitals); and hospital size (total number of hospital beds, dichotomized to below 500 and 500 or more). The clusters in each triplet were then randomized to each of the three sequences. Cluster allocation was undertaken by the trial statistician using a REDCap randomization module (Fig. 2).

Blinding

Hospital teams did not receive the EAGLE intervention material until the start of their intervention interval, to prevent contamination. As a hospital-level intervention, neither surgeons nor hospital teams were blinded; however, patients were unaware of their hospital participation status. Study teams were required to collect outcome data objectively. They were unblinded to hospital intervention status.

RESULTS

Study Selection

The electronic literature search generated 1323 articles and 980 unique articles after removing duplicates. Of these, 866 were excluded after title and abstract screening. A full-text screening of the resulting 114 articles was performed and another 101 were excluded. Cross-reference checking generated 1 additional article, and 1 more additional publication was identified after repeating the search before submission. Ultimately, 13 articles were included in the analysis (Fig. 1 A).

Study and Patient Characteristics

All 13 articles included were cohort or case-matched studies and comprised 4618 individual patients, with study sample sizes ranging from 32 to 1207 patients (Table 1). Four studies reported on colorectal resections, and all other studies focused on rectal resections. All studies included patients diagnosed with CRC, with only 2 studies also including patients with benign indications for colorectal resections (eg, diverticulitis, IBD). Because benign indications were presented separately, the outcomes of these patients were excluded from this review. The final population consisted of 4618 patients, of whom 2946 (64%) were men and 1672 (36%) women, with a mean age of 61.9 years. Among these patients, 527 (11%) developed AL and 4091 (89%) recovered without clinical, radiological, or biochemical signs of AL (Table 2). The median time of follow-up was 4.3 years (4.8 months–14.4 years). Additional study information on the perioperative care of patients in each study is provided in Supplemental S2 at.

### Early anastomotic complications in colorectal surgery: a systematic review of techniques for endoscopic salvage [^111nzpEb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

There are 41,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the UK each year. Many of these patients will undergo surgical resection with the formation of an anastomosis, often at the greatest risk below the pelvic brim for rectal cancer resection. Despite advances in surgical technique, anastomotic complications continue to be associated with a significant rate of morbidity and mortality; including potential permanent stoma formation, increased length of hospital stay, increased local recurrence and significant financial implications for an ever strained health service. Anastomotic leaks occur in 5–15% of patients following a colorectal anastomosis and are more frequently observed in those of a male sex, a BMI > 35 kg/m 2, those who have had pre-operative chemo-radiation, or patients with tumours > 5 cm in size or within 7 cm of the anal verge. Intraoperative assessment of anastomotic integrity is now common practice, whether by an air leak test, endoscopy, intraoperative dye test or laser fluorescence angiography. However, techniques to then subsequently reduce the leak rate have little evidence, including transanal decompression devices, intraluminal barriers or extraluminal devices such as tissue bolstering. The use of drains and mechanical bowel preparation also continues to be a subject of debate.

In patients who are physiologically unwell, the traditional treatment for the disruption of a colorectal anastomosis is to return to theatre for lavage and take down of the anastomosis; however, this has increasingly been the subject of some debate. Whilst this removes the source of sepsis, patients undergo a second major operation carrying a morbidity in excess of 50%. The "divert and drain" approach of a defunctioning loop ileostomy and pelvic drainage, whilst leaving the anastomosis intact, has proved increasingly popular with a success rate ranging upwards from 54%. Leaving the primary anastomosis intact avoids more complex dissection in inflamed tissue planes and has been shown to be associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of patients achieving stoma reversal. Conversely, salvaging an anastomosis in this manner may predispose patients to chronic pelvic sepsis and poor functional outcomes.

There has been increasing interest in methods of anastomotic salvage which do not require re-entry into the abdominal cavity. In selected patients, endoscopy may provide the advantage of a diagnostic element with several options for safe therapeutic management without precluding second line invasive surgical options. In this review, we aim to assess the utility of endoscopic management in the acute setting of colorectal anastomotic complications, focusing on anastomotic leak.

### Association of mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics and anastomotic leak following left sided colorectal resection: an international, multi-centre, prospective audit [^113oZYoB]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal bowel preparation strategy to minimise the risk of anastomotic leak is yet to be determined. This study aimed to determine whether oral antibiotics combined with mechanical bowel preparation (MBP+Abx) was associated with a reduced risk of anastomotic leak when compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone (MBP) or no bowel preparation (NBP).

Methods

A pre-planned analysis of the European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) 2017 Left Sided Colorectal Resection audit was performed. Patients undergoing elective left sided colonic or rectal resection with primary anastomosis between 1 January 2017 and 15 March 2017 by any operative approach were included. The primary outcome measure was anastomotic leak.

Results

Of 3676 patients across 343 centres in 47 countries, 618 (16.8%) received MBP+ABx, 1945 MBP (52.9%) and 1099 patients NBP (29.9%). Patients undergoing MBP+ABx had the lowest overall rate of anastomotic leak (6.1%, 9.2%, 8.7% respectively) in unadjusted analysis. After case-mix adjustment using a mixed-effects multivariable regression model, MBP+Abx was associated with a lower risk of anastomotic leak (OR 0.52, 0.30–0.92, P = 0.02) but MBP was not (OR 0.92, 0.63–1.36, P = 0.69) compared to NBP.

Conclusion

This non-randomised study adds 'real-world', contemporaneous, and prospective evidence of the beneficial effects of combined mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics in the prevention of anastomotic leak following left sided colorectal resection across diverse settings. We have also demonstrated limited uptake of this strategy in current international colorectal practice.

### Impact of anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery on quality of life: a systematic review [^115w2YKS]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal anastomotic leakage remains one of the most frequent and dreaded postoperative complications after colorectal resection. However, limited research has been conducted on the impact of this complication on the quality of life of patients who have undergone colorectal cancer surgery.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to identify, appraise, and synthesize the available evidence regarding the quality of life in patients with anastomotic leakage after oncological colorectal resections to inform clinical decision-making.

Data Sources and Study Selection

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies reporting quality of life using validated questionnaires in patients with anastomotic leakage after oncological colorectal resections. The literature search was performed systematically and according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Outcomes

Outcomes from quality-of-life questionnaires of patients with and without anastomotic leakage were analyzed.

Results

Thirteen articles reporting on 4618 individual patients were included, among which 527 patients developed anastomotic leakage. Quality of life was evaluated using 10 distinct questionnaires administered at various postoperative time points, ranging from 1 month to 14 years. Quality-of-life outcomes differed across studies and time points, but overall scores were most negatively affected by anastomotic leakage up to 12 months postoperatively.

Limitations

There was a high heterogeneity between the included studies based on the questionnaires used and the time of assessment.

Conclusions

The published evidence suggests that anastomotic leakage after oncologic colorectal resection is associated with impaired quality of life, especially within the first postoperative year. The impact of anastomotic leakage on quality of life warrants further evaluation and discussion with patients.

### Fluorescence angiography likely protects against anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114kxHP1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The work was reported in line with the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and AMSTAR 2 (Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched without time limit to the 13.07.2021 for RCTs written in English and assessing the effect of intra-operative FA versus standard assessment of bowel perfusion on the incidence of AL after colorectal surgery anastomosis (Table S1). Observational and/or non-randomised studies, letters, congress abstracts and secondary analyses were excluded. Publications not reporting on the incidence of AL in the group with FA and in the group without FA were excluded. Two independent reviewers (JM, HJ) performed the screening of eligible articles and the data extraction. In case of disagreement, consensus was reached with a third reviewer (RJD). Pooled relative risk (RR) and pooled risk difference (RD) were obtained using models with random effects. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated as 1/(-RD). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-test and quantified using the I 2 value. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool 2 for assessing risk of bias. The software Review Manager (RevMan 5, version 5.3, Copenhagen: the Nordic Cochrane Centre, 2014) was used for meta-analysis. The software GRADE PRO was used for GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Institutional review board approval was not required. The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021272139).

### Fluorescence angiography in laparoscopic low rectal and anorectal anastomoses with pinpoint perfusion imaging – a critical appraisal with specific focus on leak risk reduction [^114CZnkb]. Colorectal Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Anastomotic dehiscence is one of the most feared complications in colorectal surgery leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Progressively lower anastomoses are associated with a greater leak rate. One of the key factors is the perfusion of the bowel to be joined. Presently, surgeons rely on a variety subjective measures to determine anastomotic perfusion and mechanical integrity however these have shortcomings. The aim of this paper is to appraise the literature on the use of fluorescence angiography (FA) in laparoscopic rectal surgery.

Materials and Methods

A Pubmed search was undertaken using terms 'fluorescence angiography' and 'rectal surgery'. The search was expanded using the related articles function. Studies were included if they used FA specifically for rectal surgery. Outcomes of interest including anastomotic leak rate, change of operative strategy and time taken for FA were recorded.

Results

Eleven papers detailing the use of FA in rectal surgery are outlined demonstrating that this technique may change operative strategy and lead to a reduction in anastomotic leak rate.

Conclusion

In this paper, we discuss assessment of colorectal blood supply using FA and how this technique holds great potential to detect insufficiently perfused bowel. In so doing, the operator can adjust their operative strategy to mitigate these affects with the aim of reducing the complications of anastomotic leak and stenosis. However, it is highlighted that there is a clear need for randomised controlled trials in order to determine this definitively.

### International consensus on reporting anastomotic leaks after colorectal cancer surgery: the CoReAL reporting framework [^111ava6e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leak frequently complicates colorectal anastomoses with high morbidity and mortality. The substantial variability in published leak rates reflects the lack of consistency in reporting variables that may impact the occurrence, management, short and long-term outcomes of patients.

Objective

The Consensus for Reporting of colorectal Anastomotic Leaks is an international collaborative that developed a standardized evidence-based framework for reporting key variables related to the entire episode of colorectal anastomotic leak in cancer patients.

Design

Along the preoperative, intraoperative, short- and long-term postoperative phases of a left-sided colorectal anastomotic leak, key questions regarding all potentially relevant variables were formulated. A literature review was conducted to generate evidence-based statements in response to these questions. Statements that reached consensus, together with input from patients' experience and experts' opinion, were incorporated into the framework as reporting elements.

Setting

Modified Delphi methodology, including online voting and an in-person consensus meeting, was used to generate consensus statements based on the literature review, and to develop the reporting framework.

Participants

An international panel of 32 colorectal surgeons with expertise in the field of colorectal anastomotic leaks, representing 6 surgical societies, along with radiologists, research collaborators, patients, healthcare economists and surgical trial methodologists.

Main Outcome Measures

Evidence-based statements and reporting elements with > 70% agreement were included.

Results

Consensus among experts was achieved on 33 evidence-based statements and 43 reporting elements for the CoReAL framework. The reporting elements encompassed evidence-based statements (27), patient perspectives (7), as well as expert opinion (9).

Limitations

Sampling did not represent all regions in the world. Because of the paucity of evidence for some topics, evidence-based statements were primarily based on moderate to low level of evidence.

Conclusions

This international consensus provides an evidence-based standardized framework for reporting of key variables related to a colorectal anastomotic leak following oncologic resection. See Video Abstract.

### Score prediction of anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review [^113wAZhh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings reveal significant limitations in the existing scoring systems for anastomotic leakage (AL), primarily concerning the variables considered, as well as the definition and diagnostic methods used for AL. Considering these limitations, we strongly advocate for the development of a new scoring system that addresses these issues.

To overcome the limitations, we propose that a prospective cohort study be conducted, employing more accurate methods for determining AL, such as contrast enema or endoscopy, to actively detect cases. Additionally, it is crucial to systematically collect all variables that influence AL to ensure comprehensive data collection.

Furthermore, in order to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the new scoring system, a homogeneous cohort of patients should be utilized, avoiding subgroup analyses based solely on anastomosis location (right, left, or precise rectal localization) or whether the resection is oncological or not. This approach will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the predictors of AL across the spectrum of colorectal surgery.

### Clinical and economic burden of colorectal and bariatric anastomotic leaks [^116Rnw4D]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leaks cause a significant clinical and economic burden on patients undergoing bariatric and colorectal surgeries. Current literature shows a wide variation in incidence of anastomotic leaks and a significant gap in associated economic metrics. This analysis utilized claims data to quantify the full episode-of-care cost burden of leaks following colorectal and bariatric surgeries.

Methods

Medicare Fee-for-Service and commercial claims data from a large U.S.-based health plan were queried for cost and utilization of members that underwent bariatric and colorectal surgical procedures between January 1, 2013 and August 31, 2015. Outcomes were collected for members with anastomotic leaks versus those without leaks during the initial hospital stay (index) and within 30 days of the procedure. These outcomes included leak frequency, payer reimbursement, and length of stay (LOS).

Results

The colorectal Medicare analysis identified 239,350 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. For patients with a leak compared to those without, index admission costs were $30,670 greater ($48,982 vs. $18,312; p < 0.0001) and the index LOS was 12 days longer (19 vs. 7 days; p < 0.0001). This finding was similar for the bariatric patients (n = 62,292) where cost was $30,885 higher ($43,918 vs. $13,033; p < 0.0001) and LOS was 15 days longer (17 vs. 2 days; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, readmissions and associated costs were also substantially higher for those with an index leak. The commercial analysis of both the bariatric and colorectal populations trended similarly to the Medicare population in regards to all outcomes measured.

Conclusion

Patients experiencing anastomotic leaks during and after bariatric and colorectal surgery have significantly higher costs and longer LOS both at the initial stay and within 30 days of the procedure. It is important that providers and hospitals understand the economic consequences of these procedures and implement technologies and techniques to prevent/reduce anastomotic leaks.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Q6.9: What is the optimal strategy of colorectal anastomosis, and how could this be assessed?

Statement: Postoperative morbidity is not impacted by choice of hand-sewn or stapled anastomosis for elective resection of diverticular disease.

Recommendation: We recommend the use of either a hand-sewn or stapled anastomosis based on individual surgeon preference. (LoE: low. Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^111RucFs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be implemented before the induction of anesthesia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

Multiple studies have demonstrated that minimizing opioids after colorectal surgery is associated with earlier return of bowel function and shorter length of stay. One of the simplest techniques to limit opioid use is to schedule non-narcotic alternatives, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rather than administering them on an as-needed basis. There have been ongoing concerns about the postoperative safety profile of NSAIDs in this setting. However, a 2007 Cochrane review concluded that NSAIDs can cause a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period and should therefore not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function. In addition, experimental and observational clinical studies have shown that NSAIDs may increase the risk of anastomotic leak and subsequent research has demonstrated that this potential effect on anastomotic leak appears to be molecule and class specific; diclofenac has been associated with the highest risk of leak in this setting. In a retrospective cohort study of 856 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the risk of anastomotic leak was 11.8% versus 6.0% (p = 0.01) in patients receiving diclofenac, but there was no differences in leak rates related to other nonsteroidals. Additionally, two meta-analyses have demonstrated an overall increased risk of anastomotic leak with NSAIDs but no increase in the risk of anastomotic leak with the use of selective NSAIDs (such as cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors). In these studies nonselective NSAID diclofenac use was associated with an increased leak rate (OR 2.79 [1.96, 3.96], p < 0.001 and pooled OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.62–2.50, p < 0.001), while ketorolac and selective NSAIDS were not associated with anastomotic leak. In addition, a large multicenter cohort study in Europe showed no differences in anastomotic leak rate with nonselective NSAIDs.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^117X57Kk]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery — nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains: The routine use of intra-abdominal drains and nasogastric tubes for colorectal surgery should be avoided. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Nasogastric tubes should not be routinely used and should be reserved for patients with postoperative ileus refractory to more conservative management; RCTs show that patients without nasogastric tubes have no difference in nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function, or increased length of stay versus those with tubes and tolerate oral intake 2 days earlier, while tube use is associated with a significantly higher risk of complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis. For intra-abdominal drains, there are no data to support routine use to identify and prophylactically treat anastomotic leaks; available RCTs show no significant difference in mortality, leak, or composite postoperative complications with drainage, and meta-analyses show no added benefit in benign or malignant disease. The location of the anastomosis in relation to the peritoneal reflection does not appear to impact the use of drainage.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Q6.4: What is the role of bowel preparation prior to surgery in the management of diverticulitis?

Statement: Although we found no evidence specific to diverticular disease, in a general colorectal population, the use of mechanical bowel preparation is associated with decreased rates of SSI and anastomotic leak when combined with oral antibiotics.

Recommendation: While the evidence specific to diverticular disease is limited, evidence exists in the setting of elective colorectal surgery to recommend the use of an isosmotic mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics prior to surgery. (LoE: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Membership survey results: Yes 584 (87.95%).

Q6.5: What is the optimal surgical strategy in the elective setting for complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis?

Statement: There is limited data to guide surgical strategy in the elective setting for complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis. Data are mixed regarding the benefits of IMA preservation versus high ligation in preventing anastomotic leak.

Recommendation: Preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery should be considered to preserve vascular supply of the anastomosis (so long as this does not compromise formation of a tension-free anastomosis). (LoE: low. Strength of recommendation: weak).

Membership survey results: Yes 599 (90.48%).

462 members (69.79%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 80 (12.08%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 120 (18.13%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

### Randomized clinical trial of biodegradeable intraluminal sheath to prevent anastomotic leak after stapled colorectal anastomosis [^112zJZ5r]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage is a potential major complication after colorectal surgery. The C-seal was developed to help reduce the clinical leakage rate. It is an intraluminal sheath that is stapled proximal to a colorectal anastomosis, covering it intraluminally and thus preventing intestinal leakage in case of anastomotic dehiscence. The C-seal trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of the C-seal in reducing anastomotic leakage in stapled colorectal anastomoses.

Methods

This RCT was performed in 41 hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Hungary and Spain. Patients undergoing elective surgery with a stapled colorectal anastomosis less than 15cm from the anal verge were eligible. Included patients were randomized to the C-seal and control groups, stratified for centre, anastomotic height and intention to create a defunctioning stoma. Primary outcome was anastomotic leakage requiring invasive treatment.

Results

Between December 2011 and December 2013, 402 patients were included in the trial, 202 in the C-seal group and 200 in the control group. Anastomotic leakage was diagnosed in 31 patients (7·7 per cent), with a 10·4 per cent leak rate in the C-seal group and 5·0 per cent in the control group (P = 0·060). Male sex showed a trend towards a higher leak rate (P = 0·055). Construction of a defunctioning stoma led to a lower leakage rate, although this was not significant (P = 0·095).

Conclusion

C-seal application in stapled colorectal anastomoses does not reduce anastomotic leakage. Registration number: NTR3080 (http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp).

### Intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment methods and their effects on anastomotic leak rates: meta-analysis [^116u16z2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a systematic review of all available data on the use of intraoperative bowel perfusion imaging during colorectal surgery. The study was registered with PROSPERO before initiation of searches (CRD42021297299, 9 December 2021). Expert surgeons, librarians, and statisticians were consulted on the study design, search methodology, and statistical analysis.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

RCTs and comparative studies that used intraoperative perfusion assessment methods to identify bowel perfusion, and documented the rates of anastomotic leakage after surgery, were included. Procedures performed must have been elective and were not limited to minimally invasive surgery. All studies must have been clinical and related to humans, with both demographic and anastomotic leakage data available. A time limit of 21 years (2001–2022) was used to ensure that only relevant studies of intraoperative perfusion imaging were included in what is a relatively new intervention, first described in 1993. Participants in the studies must have been adults with a colorectal pathology requiring intervention. Only English-language studies were included. Studies were excluded if full articles were not accessible or they were systematic reviews or case reports. Where studies used multiple methods of perfusion assessment, only the modality that was used first was included as this was most likely to influence the decision regarding anastomotic site.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the incidence of anastomotic leak within 30 days of major colorectal surgery involving intraoperative use of bowel perfusion imaging. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic site location changes, tissue oxygenation measurements, threshold of perfusion cut-offs, and sensitivities.

Search strategy

Sources searched included Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science. The first literature search was undertaken on 28 December 2021, with subsequent searches carried out on 1 March 2021 and 29 July 2022. Searches were supplemented by reviews of studies included in relevant systematic reviews to that ensure all available studies were included. The following Boolean search terms were applied: (Ascending Colon OR Colon OR Sigmoid OR Colorectal Surgery OR Bowel) AND (Surgical Anastomosis OR Postoperative Complications OR Anastomotic Leak OR Postoperative Complications) AND (Perfusion OR Perfusion Index OR Perfusion Imaging OR Ischemia OR Imagery).

Colorectal surgery — nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains: The routine use of nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains for colorectal surgery should be avoided (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Small randomized trials show no benefit of routine nasogastric tube decompression on nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function, or LOS, and routine nasogastric decompression delays tolerance of oral intake by an average of 2 days with higher risk of complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis. For drains, randomized trials show no significant differences in mortality, leak, or composite postoperative complications with drains, and a US Rectal Cancer Consortium review found higher leak rates with drains with no difference in intervention for leak; however, a Dutch TME analysis suggested that intra-abdominal drains with a diverting stoma may be associated with lower rates of surgical intervention in anastomotic failure.

### Defining anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery: results of a national survey [^116SJpe5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leaks are a dreaded complication after colorectal surgery. Although anastomotic leak is often used as a metric to compare patient outcomes, a standard definition does not exist.

Materials and Methods

A web-based survey was developed and distributed to US surgeons. Respondents were queried on the definition of anastomotic leaks using a 5-point Likert scale to rate different scenarios related to colorectal surgery.

Results

Of potential 2209 respondents, 649 (29%) responded to the survey. The majority of respondents was men (76%) and practiced colon and rectal surgery as their primary specialty (89%). Contrast extravasation at the anastomosis, regardless of timing related to the surgery, is the clinical scenario with greatest consensus (> 85%). 50% of surgeons do not believe that an abscess near the anastomosis in an asymptomatic patient defines a leak.

Conclusions

These results highlight the pressing need for standardization of the anastomotic leak definition given the implications on outcomes measurement, research trials, and health care reimbursement.

### Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in prevention of colorectal anastomotic leakage: a randomized clinical trial [^112G4nm7]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Anastomotic leakage is a severe complication of colorectal surgery, occurring in 2.8% to 19% of patients. It not only serves as a critical factor in determining a patient's prognosis, but also significantly impacts their overall quality of life. Anastomotic leakage triples the financial cost of the operation. Moreover, it profoundly affects oncological outcomes, potentially delaying or preventing the timely administration of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Clinical assessment of anastomotic leak risk is challenging even for experienced surgeons. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble fluorescent dye that binds to plasma proteins and is an excellent tool for assessing tissue perfusion. ICG absorbs and emits near-infrared light that can be visualized by special near-infrared fluorescence imaging devices such as modern laparoscopic cameras. Traditionally, surgeons assess anastomosis viability based on bowel color and arterial bleeding from the transected end of the bowel. ICG fluorescence imaging has been used to enhance perfusion assessment at planned anastomotic sites for more than a decade.

Most studies on ICG fluorescence imaging are retrospective, focused on left-sided operations and rectal resections, and include only a small number of patients. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggest a beneficial effect of ICG fluorescence imaging on reducing anastomotic leakage and complications. Intraoperative ICG imaging appears to halve anastomotic leak risk, with reported rates around 3.8% with ICG fluorescence imaging vs 7.5% in colorectal surgeryand 9% vs 13.9% in rectal resections, respectively. The results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are conflicting and mainly derived from rectal resections. There is only 1 RCT also including right-sided colectomies.

The primary aim of our study was to compare the anastomosis leak rate in colorectal surgery while excluding low anterior resections. Anastomosis perfusion was assessed by ICG fluorescence imaging compared with clinical assessment alone. Secondary aims involved assessing variables such as the severity of anastomosis leakage, hospital readmission rate, reoperation rate, complications graded by Clavien-Dindo classification, and operation time. Our hypothesis was that the use of ICG fluorescence imaging decreases the anastomotic leakage rate.

### Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in prevention of colorectal anastomotic leakage: a randomized clinical trial [^112zyFz9]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that routine use of ICG fluorescence imaging does not significantly reduce the overall anastomotic leak rate in laparoscopic colorectal surgery if low anterior resections are excluded. We conclude that routine use of ICG fluorescence imaging in laparoscopic colon surgery does not appear to be warranted. However, it may offer potential benefits for left-sided colorectal operations in preventing anastomotic leakage.

### Multicentre phase II trial of near-infrared imaging in elective colorectal surgery [^113JkZpM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Decreasing anastomotic leak rates remain a major goal in colorectal surgery. Assessing intraoperative perfusion by indocyanine green (ICG) with near‐infrared (NIR) visualization may assist in selection of intestinal transection level and subsequent anastomotic vascular sufficiency. This study examined the use of NIR‐ICG imaging in colorectal surgery.

Methods

This was a prospective phase II study (NCT02459405) of non‐selected patients undergoing any elective colorectal operation with anastomosis over a 3‐year interval in three tertiary hospitals. A standard protocol was followed to assess NIR‐ICG perfusion before and after anastomosis construction in comparison with standard operator visual assessment alone.

Results

Five hundred and four patients (median age 64 years, 279 men) having surgery for neoplastic (330) and benign (174) pathology were studied. Some 425 operations (85·3 per cent) were started laparoscopically, with a conversion rate of 5·9 per cent. In all, 220 patients (43·7 per cent) underwent high anterior resection or reversal of Hartmann's operation, and 90 (17·9 per cent) low anterior resection. ICG angiography was achieved in every patient, with a median interval of 29 s to visualization of the signal after injection. NIR‐ICG assessment resulted in a change in the site of bowel division in 29 patients (5·8 per cent) with no subsequent leaks in these patients. Leak rates were 2·4 per cent overall (12 of 504), 2·6 per cent for colorectal anastomoses and 3 per cent for low anterior resection. When NIR‐ICG imaging was used, the anastomotic leak rates were lower than those in the participating centres from over 1000 similar operations performed with identical technique but without NIR‐ICG technology.

Conclusion

Routine NIR‐ICG assessment in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery is feasible. NIR‐ICG use may change intraoperative decisions, which may lead to a reduction in anastomotic leak rates.

### Early anastomotic complications in colorectal surgery: a systematic review of techniques for endoscopic salvage [^1152LA6w]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Whilst technical success and avoidance of re-operative surgery is clearly an advantageous starting point, we must consider the potential sequelae of endoscopic salvage both in terms of the risk of chronic pelvic sepsis and adverse functional outcomes. Nesbakken et al. directly compared the functional outcomes of 11 patients post anastomotic leak and subsequent stoma closure with 11 patients undergoing an uncomplicated low anterior resection. Patients who had experienced leakage had a trend towards reduced neorectal capacity (p = 0.04), faecal urgency (p = 0.09) and incontinence (p = 0.06). Hallbook et al. showed a similar picture in their study of 19 patients. Ashburn et al. followed up 52 patients with an anastomotic leak following restorative colorectal resection. They identified a significantly worse SF-36 physical and mental component scale at 1 year. Kiely et al. also showed reduced quality of life (p < 0.001) and increased daytime leakage in patients with chronic pelvic sepsis post-pouch formation. Mongin et al. described poorer outcomes for lifestyle, coping/behaviour, depression and self-perception for patients with an anastomotic leak post-sphincter saving total mesorectal excision on FIQL scores. As none of these papers focused upon endoscopic anastomotic salvage, it is vital that future studies which do strive to determine the relationship between technical success and functional outcomes.

In conclusion, endoscopic therapy in the management of stable patients with colorectal anastomotic leaks appears safe and in selected patients is associated with high rates of technical success. Challenges remain in selecting the most appropriate strategy and understanding the functional and long-term sequelae of this approach. There is little evidence available detailing functional outcomes after anastomotic salvage. Large prospective cohort studies are needed to further evaluate the role of these novel strategies with a focus on patient reported outcome measures as the primary outcome rather than technical success alone.

### Intraoperative angiography with indocyanine green to assess anastomosis perfusion in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection: results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^1135SLUv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Insufficient vascular supply is one of the main causes of anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery. Intraoperative indocyanine-green (ICG) angiography has been shown to provide information on tissue perfusion, identifying a well-perfused location for colonic and rectal transections, and thus possibly reducing the leak rate. Aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative assessment of anastomotic perfusion using ICG angiography in patients undergoing left-sided colon or rectal resection with colorectal anastomosis.

Methods

This randomized trial involved 252 patients undergoing laparoscopic left-sided colon and rectal resection randomized 1:1 to intraoperative ICG or to subjective visual evaluation of the bowel perfusion without ICG. The primary aim was to assess whether ICG angiography could lead to a reduction in anastomotic leak rate. Secondary outcomes were possible changes in the surgical strategy and postoperative morbidity.

Results

After randomization, 12 patients were excluded. Accordingly, 240 patients were included in the analysis; 118 were in the study group, and 122 in the control group. ICG angiography showed insufficient perfusion of the colic stump, which led to extended bowel resection in 13 cases (11%). An anastomotic leak developed in 11 patients (9%) in the control group and in 6 patients (5%) in the study group (p = n.s.).

Conclusions

Intraoperative ICG fluorescent angiography can effectively assess vascularization of the colic stump and anastomosis in patients undergoing colorectal resection. This method led to further proximal bowel resection in 13 cases, however, there was no statistically significant reduction of anastomotic leak rate in the ICG arm.

### Intraoperative bowel perfusion assessment methods and their effects on anastomotic leak rates: meta-analysis [^115xVma2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Anastomotic leak is one of the most feared complications of colorectal surgery, and probably linked to poor blood supply to the anastomotic site. Several technologies have been described for intraoperative assessment of bowel perfusion. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the most frequently used bowel perfusion assessment modalities in elective colorectal procedures, and to assess their associated risk of anastomotic leak. Technologies included indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser speckle contrast imaging, and hyperspectral imaging.

Methods

The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42021297299). A comprehensive literature search was performed using Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science. The final search was undertaken on 29 July 2022. Data were extracted by two reviewers and the MINORS criteria were applied to assess the risk of bias.

Results

Some 66 eligible studies involving 11 560 participants were included. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography was most used with 10 789 participants, followed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with 321, hyperspectral imaging with 265, and laser speckle contrast imaging with 185. In the meta-analysis, the total pooled effect of an intervention on anastomotic leak was 0.05 (95 per cent c.i. 0.04 to 0.07) in comparison with 0.10 (0.08 to 0.12) without. Use of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, or laser speckle contrast imaging was associated with a significant reduction in anastomotic leak.

Conclusion

Bowel perfusion assessment reduced the incidence of anastomotic leak, with intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, and laser speckle contrast imaging all demonstrating comparable results.

6. Mechanical bowel preparation combined with preoperative oral antibiotics is typically recommended before elective colorectal resection. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2011 Cochrane review of RCTs showed no benefit to mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) alone in colorectal surgery in reducing anastomotic leak or complications. Meanwhile, a meta-analysis of 7 RCTs, including 1769 patients comparing MBP with oral antibiotics to MBP alone, showed a reduction in total SSI (7.2% versus 16.0%; p < 0.001) and incisional site infection (4.6% versus 12.1%; p < 0.001), with no difference in the rate of organ/space infection after elective colorectal surgery. These trial findings are consistent with population-level data. In a retrospective analysis of a nationwide database from the United States, MBP plus oral antibiotic preparation in left colon resection was associated with decreased overall morbidity, superficial SSI, anastomotic leakage, and intra-abdominal infections. Similar retrospective studies in different populations (Veterans Administration databaseand a Polish hospital database) have also shown a reduction in SSI with the addition of oral bowel preparation to MBP. The Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative database showed reductions in SSI and in postoperative Clostridium difficile colitis in patients who received MBP and oral bowel preparation versus patients who received no bowel preparation. These kinds of data supported the ASCRS 2019 Clinical Practice Guideline on Bowel Preparation, recommending the use of a MBP combined with preoperative oral antibiotics in elective colorectal surgery.

### Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in prevention of colorectal anastomotic leakage: a randomized clinical trial [^112rbFqE]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Performing a bowel anastomosis is a critical step in colorectal resection. Assessing the risk of anastomotic leakage remains challenging, even for experienced surgeons.

Objective

To evaluate the use of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in assessing perfusion at the anastomotic site before and after anastomosis and determine whether it helps reduce anastomotic leakages.

Design, Setting, and Participants

ICG-COLORAL is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study conducted from September 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023. Participants were recruited during preoperative outpatient clinic visits by clinicians not involved in the study, as well as by researchers. Participants were elective patients scheduled for laparoscopic resections, excluding low anterior resections, with planned primary anastomosis in 5 Finnish public hospitals experienced in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

Intervention

The intervention group received 5 mg of ICG intravenously before and after anastomosis formation. The fluorescence signal was assessed with a near-infrared-capable camera. The control group did not receive ICG fluorescence imaging.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary outcome measure was the anastomotic leak rate as detected by computed tomography.

Results

Among 1136 patients in the intention-to-treat population, 526 (46.3%) were female and 610 (53.7%) male; they had a mean (SD) age of 70 (11) years, body mass index of 28 (5), and age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index of 5 (3). Overall, the anastomotic leak rate was 5.8% (33/567) in the ICG fluorescence imaging group vs 7.9% (45/569) in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48–1.13; p = 0.16). For right-sided operations, the anastomotic leak rate with ICG fluorescence imaging was 5.9% (16/273) vs 6.7% (20/298) in the control group (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.46–1.65). For left-sided operations, the anastomotic leak rate was 5.2% (14/267) with ICG fluorescence imaging vs 9.5% (23/243) without (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.29–1.05). No patients reported adverse events related to ICG.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that routine use of ICG fluorescence imaging does not significantly reduce the overall anastomotic leak rate in laparoscopic colorectal surgery if low anterior resections are excluded but may be beneficial in left-sided operations.

### A near-zero anastomotic leak rate in cytoreductive surgery with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy is achievable [^111RD28P]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal complications are the main source of severe morbidity after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), mainly in the form of anastomotic leak. Reducing the rate of anastomotic leaks is of paramount importance and should be approached both through risk factor understanding and reduction, as well as optimization of surgical team performance. We performed a study that describes the details of a technical protocol for the creation of anastomoses after colorectal resections in CRS and HIPEC and the anastomotic outcomes associated with its systematic application in a high-volume peritoneal surface malignancy center. An extremely low, near-zero anastomotic leak rate (0.85% in colorectal anastomoses, 1% in ileo-colic anastomoses, and 0% in ileo-rectal anastomoses) was observed among 1172 patients. Extremely low, near-zero rates of anastomotic leak after colorectal resections in CRS and HIPEC could be achievable in high-volume peritoneal malignancy centers. The described techniques could be adopted and validated in other high-volume peritoneal malignancy centers.

Conclusion

Routine NIR-ICG assessment in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery is feasible. NIR-ICG use may change intraoperative decisions, which may lead to a reduction in anastomotic leak rates.

### Stapled versus handsewn methods for colorectal anastomosis surgery [^113RLAV5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previous systematic reviews comparing stapled and handsewn colorectal anastomosis that are available in the medical literature have not shown either technique to be superior. An update of this systematic review was performed to find out if there are any data that properly answer this question.

Objectives

To compare the safety and effectiveness of stapled and handsewn colorectal anastomosis surgery. The following primary hypothesis was tested: the stapled technique is more effective because it decreases the level of complications.

Search Methods

A computerized search was performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE according to the strategies of the Colorectal Cancer Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. There were no limits upon language, date or other criteria. A revised search strategy was performed for this updated version of the review May 2011.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which stapled and handsewn colorectal anastomosis techniques were compared. Participants were adult patients undergoing elective colorectal anastomosis surgery. The interventions were endoluminal circular stapler and handsewn colorectal anastomosis surgery. Outcomes considered were a) mortality; b) overall anastomotic dehiscence; c) clinical anastomotic dehiscence; d) radiological anastomotic dehiscence; e) stricture; f) anastomotic haemorrhage; g) reoperation; h) wound infection; i) anastomosis duration; and j) hospital stay.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently analysed by the two review authors (CBN, SASL) and cross-checked. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two authors. After searching the literature for this update, no study was added to those in the previous version of this review. Details of randomizations (generation and concealment), blinding, whether an intention-to-treat analysis was done or not, and the number of patients lost to follow-up were recorded. The analysis of the risk of bias was updated according to the software Review Manager 5.1. The results of each RCT were summarized on an intention-to-treat basis in 2 x 2 tables for each outcome. External validity was defined by the characteristics of the participants, interventions and the outcomes. The RCTs were stratified according to the level of colorectal anastomosis. The risk difference (RD) method (random-effects model) and number needed to treat (NNT) for dichotomous outcome measures and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes measures, with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), were presented in this review. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using a funnel plot and the Chi(2) test.

Main Results

Of the 1233 patients enrolled in nine identified trials, 622 were treated with staples and 611 with manual suture. The following main results were obtained. a) Mortality, result based on 901 patients: RD -0.6%, 95% CI -2.8% to +1.6%. b) Overall dehiscence, result based on 1233 patients: RD 0.2%, 95% CI -5.0% to +5.3%. c) Clinical anastomotic dehiscence, result based on 1233 patients: RD -1.4%, 95% CI -5.2 to +2.3%. d) Radiological anastomotic dehiscence, result based on 825 patients: RD 1.2%, 95% CI -4.8% to +7.3%. e) Stricture, result based on 1042 patients: RD 4.6%, 95% CI 1.2% to 8.1%; NNT 17, 95% CI 12 to 31. f) Anastomotic haemorrhage, result based on 662 patients: RD 2.7%, 95% CI -0.1% to +5.5%. g) Reoperation, result based on 544 patients: RD 3.9%, 95% CI 0.3% to 7.4%. h) Wound infection, result based on 567 patients: RD 1.0%, 95% CI -2.2% to +4.3%. i) Anastomosis duration, result based on one study (159 patients): WMD -7.6 minutes, 95% CI -12.9 to -2.2 minutes. j) Hospital stay, result based on one study (159 patients): WMD 2.0 days, 95% CI -3.27 to +7.2 days.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence found was insufficient to demonstrate any superiority of stapled over handsewn techniques in colorectal anastomosis surgery, regardless of the level of anastomosis. There were no randomised clinical trials comparing these two types of anastomosis in elective conditions in the last decade. The relevance of this research question has possibly lost its strength where elective surgery is concerned. However, in risk situations, such as emergency surgery, trauma and inflammatory bowel disease, new clinical trials are needed.

Mechanical bowel preparation combined with preoperative oral antibiotics is typically recommended prior to elective colorectal resection. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

A 2011 Cochrane review of RCTs showed no benefit to mechanical bowel prep (MBP) alone in colorectal surgery in reducing anastomotic leak or complications. Meanwhile, a meta-analysis of seven RCTs including 1769 patients comparing MBP with oral antibiotics to MBP alone showed a reduction in total surgical site infection (7.2% vs 16.0%, p < 0.001) and incisional site infection (4.6% vs 12.1%, p < 0.001), with no difference in the rate of organ/space infection after elective colorectal surgery. These trial findings are consistent with population level data. In a retrospective analysis of a nationwide database from the United States, MBP plus oral antibiotic prep in left colon resection was associated with decreased overall morbidity, superficial surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, and intra-abdominal infections. Similar retrospective studies in different populations (Veterans Administration database and a Polish hospital database) have also shown a reduction in surgical site infection with the addition of OBP to MBP. The Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative database showed reductions in surgical site infection and in postoperative C. difficile colitis in patients who received MBP and OBP versus patients who received no bowel prep. These kinds of data supported the ASCRS 2019 Clinical Practice Guideline on Bowel Preparation recommending the use of a mechanical bowel prep combined with preoperative oral antibiotics in elective colorectal surgery.

### Preventing complications in colorectal anastomosis: results of a randomized controlled trial using bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement for circular stapler [^112BidtW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic complications, including leaks, stenoses, and bleeding, cause considerable mortality and morbidity after colorectal surgery.

Objetive

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement in reducing colorectal anastomotic complications.

Design

This was a prospective randomized clinical study.

Settings

This study was conducted at a university hospital within a specialized colorectal unit.

Patients

Patients undergoing left colon resection for a benign or malignant condition were eligible. A total of 302 patients participated, including 154 control subjects and 148 with reinforcement.

Intervention

Patients were prospectively randomly assigned to reinforcement of circular stapled anastomosis with a bioabsorbable device versus stapled circular anastomosis without reinforcement.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was the rate of pooled incidences of anastomotic complications (leakage, bleeding, or stenosis). Secondary outcomes were the rate of reoperations and the length of hospital stay.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in the pooled incidences of anastomotic complications (p = 0.821). Regarding individual complications, we did not observe statistical differences between groups, including leakage (6.6% vs 4.8%; p = 0.518), hemorrhage (1.4% vs 1.3%; p = 0.431), or stenosis (2.9% vs 6.8%; p = 0.128). Again, no significant differences were observed in length of stay (7 days; p = 0.242) or rate of reoperation (7.3% vs 9.6%; p = 0.490). A patient (0.3%) in the control group died.

Limitations

Sample size calculation was performed including all 3 of the complications, which may render it underpowered to detect differences regarding a specific complication. Anastomoses located within 5 cm from the anal verge were excluded from the study.

Conclusions

The results obtained show that bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement in a colorectal anastomosis > 5 cm from the anal verge does not reduce the rate of pooled anastomotic complications (ie, leaks, bleeding, or stenosis).

### Postoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of anastomotic leak: meta-analysis of clinical and experimental studies [^116iNVNV]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Enhanced recovery programs following colorectal resection recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as part of multimodal analgesia. The present study aimed to assess whether postoperative NSAID use increased the risk of anastomotic leak.

Methods

A systematic review of published literature was performed for studies comparing anastomotic leak following NSAID administration versus control. Meta-analysis was conducted for studies in human patients and experimental animal models. The primary endpoint was anastomotic leak.

Results

The final analysis included 8 studies in humans and 12 experimental animal studies. Use of NSAIDs was significantly associated with anastomotic leak in humans (8 studies, 4,464 patients, odds ratio [OR] 2.14; p < 0.001). This effect was seen with nonselective NSAIDs (6 studies, 3,074 patients, OR 2.37; p < 0.001), but not with selective NSAIDs (4 studies, 1,223 patients, OR 2.32; p = 0.170). There was strong evidence of selection bias from all clinical studies, with additional inconsistent definitions and outcomes assessment. From experimental animal models, anastomotic leak was more likely with NSAID use (ten studies, 575 animals, OR 9.51; p < 0.001). Bursting pressures at day 7 were significantly lower in NSAID versus controls (7 studies, 168 animals, weighted mean difference -35.7 mmHg; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Emerging data strongly suggest that postoperative NSAIDs are linked to anastomotic leak, although most studies are flawed and may be describing pre-existing selection bias. However, when combined with experimental data, these increasing concerns suggest caution is needed when prescribing NSAIDs to patients with pre-existing risk factors for leak, until more definitive evidence emerges.

### Implementation of an organ space infection prevention bundle reduces the rate of organ space infection after elective colorectal surgery [^11729EC9]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

The addition of oral antibiotics to mechanical bowel preparation has been associated with reduced anastomotic leaks, SSI rates and ileus in elective colorectal surgery. Access to oral neomycin for use as bowel preparation prior to colorectal surgery is limited in Australia, requiring individual application for TGA approval for use in each patient. This study supports the use of oral antibiotics in addition to mechanical bowel preparation as part of a bundle to reduce OSI in elective colorectal surgery, and makes an argument for easier access to and prescribing of neomycin in Australia. Limited evidence is available about the efficacy of oral antibiotics in the absence of mechanical bowel preparation, and further investigation is required to measure an effect on SSI outcomes.

Longer operation times are an independent risk factor for SSI in rectal surgery; however, it would be difficult to determine if the grade of surgical gowns used was a contributing factor leading to higher rates of OSI. Nonetheless, this finding is a pertinent reminder that surgeons have to be at the front line of quality improvement measures to better patient care and outcomes.

While reducing complications has intrinsic merit for patients and practitioners, most hospitals require a business case for new initiatives. Most OSI bundle items required consistency of behaviour rather than new consumables. The cost of the new items in the OSI was small: $A5.29 per patient. The projected savings was based on the cost estimate of $A36 905 per OSI. This is a slight underestimate as one readmission at another hospital was not included as the cost was not available. For our second cohort, the OSI bundle reduced the expected number of OSI by 8, saving $295 198. Bed-days saved have also been a proposed method of costing hospital-acquired infections. In our study, the median LOS for patients without an OSI was 6 days compared with 15.5 days for patients with an OSI (p < 0.01). Both outcomes support the use of the OSI bundle as a cost-effective strategy.

### Invited commentary: management of low colorectal / coloanal anastomotic leak: results of a French national inter-groups practice survey [^112zBcNq]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Anastomotic leakage (AL) persists as the most significant postoperative complication following low anterior resection (LAR) or coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in the surgical management of rectal cancer. Despite considerable advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management protocols, AL continues to adversely affect both immediate postoperative outcomes and long‐term oncological and functional results. Contemporary literature demonstrates that the incidence of this complication remains at approximately 10%–15%, even within high‐volume tertiary referral centers with specialized colorectal units.

Although various diagnostic modalities — such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) monitoring, high‐resolution computed tomography (CT), early‐onset pain as a clinical predictor, and drain‐fluid amylase measurement — have proven useful, clinical practice still lacks standardized guidelines.

Pastier et al. addressed this gap by surveying 203 French colorectal surgeons on 24 standardized clinical scenarios and distilling the first consensus‐driven algorithm that spans both diagnosis and treatment of AL in patients with a diverting ileostomy. Four easily monitored warning signs — CRP > 250 mg/L, fever ≥ 38.5°C, tachycardia > 100 bpm, and diffuse abdominal pain — were endorsed as triggers for urgent contrast‐enhanced CT without rectal contrast, considered reliable only from postoperative day 3 in two‐thirds of respondents; once any sign is present, 87% recommend immediate imaging.

The treatment algorithm is equally explicit: isolated extra‐digestive air or uncollected effusion is managed with antibiotics alone in 61%–78% of surgeons; a peri‐anastomotic abscess prompts examination under anesthesia, permitting transanal drainage when indicated, in 70%; negative‐pressure endoluminal vacuum therapy is viewed as useful by a slim majority (51%), reflecting its growing acceptance as an organ‐preserving adjunct; and drains are removed when follow‐up imaging confirms resolution of the collection in 64%, illustrating a structured "image‐guided" endpoint. Nearly all participants (97%) prescribe at least 7 days of systemic antibiotics alongside any drainage modality, highlighting consensus on infection control.

Future reports detailing clinical outcomes — such as the success rates of transanal drainage and endoluminal vacuum therapy, rates of anastomotic reconstruction, and stoma avoidance — will further enhance the value of this work. Given its grounding in real‐world data and applicability to everyday practice, Pastier et al.'s study may play a key role in standardizing anastomotic leak management.

### Risk factors for unplanned 31-day readmission after surgery for colorectal cancer patients: a meta-analysis [^112zd4Mz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, optimizing perioperative management, particularly in preventing and addressing high-risk complications such as infections and intestinal obstruction, is a key strategy for reducing the incidence of UR after surgery. The ASCRS emphasizes the importance of preventing surgical site infections (SSI) in clinical practice and recommends implementing evidence-based SSI prevention bundles. Studies have demonstrated that these comprehensive interventions effectively reduce the incidence of SSI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. A 2018 RCT demonstrated that an enhanced SSI prevention bundle — comprising antibiotic peritoneal lavage, triclosan-coated sutures to inhibit bacterial growth, and mupirocin ointment for additional infection control — reduced SSI rates from 16 to 4%. Furthermore, a study from Finland highlighted the role of preoperative bowel preparation combined with oral antimicrobial agents in reducing not only overall postoperative complications but also SSI and anastomotic leakage in colorectal cancer patients, ultimately lowering the risk of postoperative readmission. Beyond infection control, early recovery of bowel function is crucial in preventing postoperative intestinal obstruction. A meta-analysis showed that early oral intake within 24 h postoperatively, compared to delayed feeding, significantly promotes the recovery of gastrointestinal function. A review further highlighted several effective interventions for enhancing gastrointestinal recovery and preventing postoperative intestinal obstruction. These include coffee consumption and chewing gum to stimulate gut motility, probiotic supplementation to support gut microbiota, minimally invasive surgery to reduce surgical trauma, and Daikenchuto — a traditional Japanese herbal medicine composed of dried ginger, ginseng, and zanthoxylum fruit — known for its prokinetic and anti-inflammatory effects. These measures not only improve patient outcomes but also shorten hospital stays, ultimately reducing the risk of unplanned readmission.

### Cost and outcomes of side-to-side versus end-to-end anastomosis in right colectomy: a retrospective cohort study [^112Xx4yL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Right-sided colectomy, a common surgical procedure for benign and malignant colorectal diseases, requires precise and effective anastomotic techniques to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of this surgery, a gold standard has yet to be established for the anastomotic technique to restore intestinal continuity between the ileum and colon. Various methods have been employed, including side-to-side or end-to-end configurations and hand-sewn or stapled anastomoses. Yet, comparative studies have failed to demonstrate a definitive advantage of one technique over the others. This lack of differentiation pertains to several critical factors such as surgical or oncological outcomes, postoperative complications, and functional recovery.

One of the most significant postoperative concerns is anastomotic leakage, a complication with serious implications for patient recovery and an increase in readmission rates. However, current research does not indicate a clear superiority of any specific anastomotic technique in reducing the incidence of this feared complication. Similarly, assessments of functional outcomes and oncological outcomes have not revealed substantial differences among the different anastomotic methods.

In light of the inconclusive evidence regarding the optimal anastomotic technique in relation to safety, it becomes imperative to consider other factors that might influence the choice of method. In the context of increasingly cost-constrained healthcare settings, the financial implications of each technique warrant closer examination. Understanding the cost-effectiveness of the various configurations and suture materials used for anastomoses could provide valuable insights for decision-making, potentially guiding surgeons towards more economically viable practices without compromising patient care quality.

This study aims to explore the cost dynamics of the different anastomotic techniques in right-sided colectomies.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^1137MSKk]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery — multimodal pain control: A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be used and implemented before the induction of anesthesia (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Scheduling narcotic alternatives such as oral acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gabapentin rather than as needed is described as a simple way to limit opioids, and the scheduled use of nonselective or selective NSAIDs (and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), when not contraindicated, and acetaminophen (by mouth or intravenously) has been shown to improve postoperative analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption. Regarding anastomotic safety, recent meta-analyses demonstrated that, in patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of NSAIDs in the first 48 hours after surgery, the risk of anastomotic leakage was not significantly increased, although the effect appears molecule/class specific and more pronounced with NSAIDs for a period > 3 days after surgery; another meta-analysis found higher risk exclusively in emergency colorectal surgery (OR = 1.70 (95% CI, 1.11–2.68)), and the evidence is inconclusive and does not support the avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with low cardiovascular risk. Systemic perioperative gabapentinoids, ketamine, lidocaine, and α2-agonists have been administered to improve analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption, but psychotropic adverse effects, dizziness, and sedation may impair immediate recovery, and high-dose systemic steroids have been shown to improve analgesia and pulmonary function without increasing wound complications, although additional safety data are needed. Local strategies including wound infiltration and abdominal trunk blocks with liposomal bupivacaine have shown promising results; limited data suggest transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block may be associated with decreased length of stay in laparoscopic surgery and that preoperative TAP blocks may provide better analgesia than end-of-case TAP blocks, while the efficacy of preemptive analgesia remains controversial and mainly limited to epidural blockade and TAP blocks.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^116nzBNp]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

The routine use of nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains for colorectal surgery should be avoided. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

Small RCTs evaluating elective colorectal surgery have failed to demonstrate an impact from the routine use of nasogastric tube decompression on nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function or length of stay. Alternatively, the routine use of nasogastric tube decompression delays the tolerance of oral intake by an average of two days and has been associated with significantly higher risk of associated complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis.

Similarly, there is no benefit to the routine use of intra-abdominal drains in colorectal surgery. RCTs show no significant differences in mortality, leak, or a composite of postoperative complications in patients who had drains placed. The lack of benefit from operative drains has been demonstrated across a variety of colorectal anastomoses as well as low pelvic anastomoses specifically. Meanwhile, a review of the US Rectal Cancer Consortium data found a nonstatistically significant association between drains and higher leak rates but there was no difference in the rate of intervention for leak between patients with and without drains. Notably, this was a retrospective review and drain placement was left to the discretion of the operating surgeons; drain use was likely a surrogate for patients with a higher risk for leak due to other factors. Contrary to these studies, a retrospective analysis of the Dutch TME data suggested that intra-abdominal drains in the presence of a diverting stoma may be associated with lower rates of surgical intervention in patients with anastomotic failure.

### Vacuum-assisted early transanal closure of leaking low colorectal anastomoses: the CLEAN study [^111qdcND]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Anastomotic leakage is still one of the most dreaded complications following rectal cancer surgery using total mesorectal excision (TME). Extensive research has focussed on predisposing factors. The common thought is that the leak is being caused by a broad spectrum of both adjustable and non-adjustable factors. Despite optimising surgical techniques (minimal invasive surgery) and perioperative management (ERAS), the leakage rates of colorectal anastomosis remained high (8–20%) over time. The TME creates a presacral cavity behind the anastomosis where large amounts of debris and pus can accumulate even in case of a minor anastomotic dehiscence. The anal sphincter functions as a physiologic barrier preventing drainage of the abscess cavity and neorectum via the anus.

Traditionally, if a patient presents with a symptomatic leak, the anastomosis is defunctioned, if not done so primarily. The abscess is most commonly drained either percutaneously or transanally. Half of these leaks might heal with this conventional management. But if these leaks do not heal, a chronic presacral sinus is formed. The sinus might be asymptomatic, but can also be a source of major morbidity even up to life-threatening necrotising fasciitis of the upper leg. Management of the chronic sinus means major surgery taking down the leaking anastomosis followed by either redo anastomosis or intersphincteric proctectomy with omentoplasty and permanent colostomy. The Dutch TME trial showed that after secondary stoma formation for infectious problems, the deviating stoma could not be reversed in 49% with preoperative radiotherapy as an independent predictor (HR 0.34).

Since a chronic sinus requires extensive surgical intervention, it is of great importance to prevent the leak to become a chronic sinus. A minimal invasive treatment strategy with vacuum-assisted drainage (EVAC) combined with early transanal closure of the anastomotic defect ('vacuum-assisted early transanal closure') has been very successful in the early management of leaking ileoanal anastomoses for ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial polyposis (FAP). However, these patients have a neorectum made of small bowel instead of colon, and did not receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy. For this reason we aimed to study the efficacy of vacuum-assisted early transanal closure for rectal cancer patients in terms of anastomotic healing, stoma closure, functionality of the neorectum, quality of life (QoL) and treatment-related costs.

### Predictive score for anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal cancer surgery: a decision making tool for choice of protective measures [^114kffvp]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage is the most severe complication after colorectal surgery and a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify a predictive score for postoperative leakage after colorectal cancer surgery and to evaluate its usefulness in assessing various protective measures.

Methods

A total of 159 patients were divided into test (79 patients) and validation (40 patients) groups in order to identify the risk factors and construct the predictive score. The remaining 40 patients (intervention group) were prospectively evaluated with the application of protective measures guided by risk stratification according to the predictive score.

Results

A total of 23 of 159 (14.5%) patients had anastomotic leakage, with 7 of 23 (30.4%) of them needing reoperation. 11 of 159 (6.9%) patients died, with 10 (6.3%) deaths directly associated with anastomotic leakage. The rate of leakage in the test and validation groups (nonintervention group) was 22 of 119 (18.5%), while the rate of leakage in the intervention group was 3 of 40 (7.5%). The odds ratio for anastomotic leakage in the intervention group was 0.23 compared to the nonintervention group, with a relative risk reduction of 73% for unfavorable event. The number needed to treat was 8 patients. There were also 10 of 119 (8.4%) deaths in the nonintervention group compared to 1 of 40 (2.5%) in the intervention group (Fisher's test; p = 0.18).

Conclusions

Our simple predictive score may be a valuable decision making tool that can help surgeons reliably identify patients at high risk for postoperative anastomotic leakage and apply guided intraoperative protective measures.

### Assessing surgeon behavior change after anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery [^115fkqCu]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recency effect suggests that people disproportionately value events from the immediate past when making decisions, but the extent of this impact on surgeons' decisions is unknown. This study evaluates for recency effect in surgeons by examining use of preventative leak testing before and after colorectal operations with anastomotic leaks.

Materials and Methods

Prospective cohort of adult patients (≥ 18 y) undergoing elective colorectal operations at Washington State hospitals participating in the Surgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program (2006–2013). The main outcome measure was surgeons' change in leak testing from 6 mo before to 6 mo after an anastomotic leak occurred.

Results

Across 4854 elective colorectal operations performed by 282 surgeons at 44 hospitals, there was a leak rate of 2.6% (n = 124). The 40 leaks (32%) in which the anastomosis was not tested occurred across 25 surgeons. While the ability to detect an overall difference in use of leak testing was limited by small sample size, nine (36%) of 25 surgeons increased their leak testing by 5% points or more after leaks in cases where the anastomosis was not tested. Surgeons who increased their leak testing more frequently performed operations for diverticulitis (45% versus 33%), more frequently began their cases laparoscopically (65% versus 37%), and had longer mean operative times (195 ± 99 versus 148 ± 87 min), all P < 0.001.

Conclusions

Recency effect was demonstrated by only one-third of eligible surgeons. Understanding the extent to which clinical decisions may be influenced by recency effect may be important in crafting quality improvement initiatives that require clinician behavior change.

2025. 1914. To the Editor We are deeply honored to have had the opportunity to read the insightful article published by Rinne and colleagues. 1 The authors conducted a well-designed, prospective, randomized, multicenter cohort study with an impressive sample size of 1136 patients. The study concluded that, excluding low anterior resections, the routine use of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging did not significantly reduce the overall anastomotic leak rate in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. However, it may have potential benefits in left-sided operations. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Risk factors for anastomotic leak following colorectal surgery: a case-control study… [^1154gCwJ]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Minors, patients with esophageal or gastric ALs, those undergoing weight loss procedures, patients who underwent proximal diversion at the time of the operative intervention, and patients transferred from outside institutions with diagnoses of AL were excluded. Colorectal resections were performed by 18 faculty surgeons. Use of closed suction drains, preoperative mechanical bowel preparation, operative technique, and method of anastomotic completion were at the discretion of the individual surgeon. A 2-to-1 match of control to case patients was performed. The control group comprised 64 ileocolic, 64 colorectal, 24 ileorectal, and 28 ileal–anal pouch anastomoses. Absence of any intraoperative risk factor conferred a decreased risk of AL development.

Operative technique, intraoperative blood pressure lability, method of anastomotic completion, and performance of intraoperative testing of anastomotic integrity did not influence risk of AL. Assessment of operative indication demonstrated a reciprocal association between colon cancer and AL development. Wide resection margins to healthy, uninvolved tissue coupled with strict adherence to resection along anatomic blood supply may decrease risk of AL by ensuring adequate vascular supply to the newly constructed anastomosis. In contrast, an operative indication of rectal cancer did not influence risk for development of AL. Analysis of patients in whom all 3 intraoperative risk factors were present demonstrated an OR of 22. 1, with 91% positive predictive value and 99% specificity for development of AL. Proximal diversion should strongly be considered for this subset of patients.

Assessment of additional intraoperative variables demonstrated intraoperative blood pressure lability, handsewn vs stapled completion of anastomosis, laparoscopic vs open operative technique, and performance of intraoperative testing of anastomotic integrity did not influence AL rate. The development of AL remains unpredictable in many patients. However, herein we identify several significant patient, operative, and disease-specific risk factors. Preoperative nutritional optimization as well as minimization of intraoperative time, transfusion requirement, and blood loss are essential to decrease the risk of anastomotic dehiscence. Pathologic specimen reports indicating microscopic margin involvement in patients with IBD should heighten physician awareness for the possibility of a postoperative AL.

### Contained anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery… [^114C6QEv]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Patients with contained leaks tend to be treated with percutaneous drainage, whereas the patients with free leaks tend to be treated surgically with emergent reexploration, takedown of the anastomosis and creation of an end stoma, or a proximal diversion via a loop ileostomy. 1, 8 The goals of this study were to evaluate the validity of this conventional wisdom and to compare empirically the presentation, course of treatment, morbidity, and mortality in the patients with free and contained anastomotic leaks that were in communication with the gastrointestinal tract. Notwithstanding the generally similar presentations and symptoms, we found significant differences in the initial management of leaks, depending on their classification as free or contained. Patients with contained leaks were significantly more likely to have been treated initially with either antibiotics alone or percutaneous drainage. Those with free leaks were more likely to have undergone operative intervention. A total of 14 patients underwent percutaneous drainage procedures by interventional radiology with the placement of 25 catheters. Of these patients, 4 had free leaks; these patients had an average of 2. 5 drains placed, and all but 1 of them underwent subsequent operative intervention. The remaining 10 patients had contained leaks, with each patient having a mean of 1. 5 drains placed; 7 of these patients underwent subsequent operative intervention. All drains were placed by the interventional radiology department with choice of technique and approach dictated by cross-sectional imaging and the clinical scenario and determined by the attending interventional radiologist. There are reasons to believe that early surgical intervention will improve mortality rates in those diagnosed as having contained leaks.

Alves et al1 showed that the mortality rate was 0% for patients operated on again before postoperative day 5 and 22% for those operated on after postoperative day 5. In this broader group of patients, it may still be appropriate to assume a benign course, with no need for further operative intervention. Because of this, patients whose conditions do not improve rather rapidly after percutaneous drainage should have a catheter injection to assess whether there is communication with the anastomosis. However, within our narrow definition of leak, our data argue for aggressive treatment, with no distinction between leaks classified as contained and those classified as free.
