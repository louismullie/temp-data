Rash

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and whether this could be a life-threatening eruption. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine morphology and distribution to build a prioritized differential. After that, I need to check which diagnostic tests are indicated and which are not. Finally, I will outline initial management, follow-up, and when to escalate or refer, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and that I double-check any assumptions I make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that mandate urgent action: fever with petechiae or purpura, rapidly progressive erythema with pain or necrosis, mucosal erosions or blisters, systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, recent high-risk drug exposure, or concern for necrotizing soft tissue infection. These features push me toward sepsis, meningococcemia, RMSF, SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, or necrotizing fasciitis, and I should not wait for labs before initiating empiric therapy and supportive care when suspicion is high [^11413nH8] [^1176aEnF] [^113xMK7F].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the field: onset and evolution, pruritus versus pain, fever and systemic symptoms, medication exposures including new drugs in the last 4–8 weeks, travel and animal exposures, sexual history, autoimmune disease, immunosuppression, prior similar rashes, and close contacts with similar symptoms. I should also ask about atopy, because it shifts pretest probabilities toward eczema, urticaria, and drug eruptions, and I need to remember that scabies often has pruritus in contacts and nocturnal itch, while COVID-19 rashes can be the initial or only manifestation of infection [^113F39rh] [^115hHewQ] [^112jDg9H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm morphology next: maculopapular or morbilliform, urticarial, vesiculobullous, pustular, petechial/purpuric, annular/targetoid, nodular, or papulosquamous. Then I will map distribution — acral, truncal, flexural, extensor, palms/soles, mucosa, scalp, genitals, and whether it is symmetric or asymmetric. Finally, I will assess evolution — discrete versus confluent, centrifugal spread, central clearing, and whether lesions are fixed or evanescent, because fixed target lesions for more than 7 days favor erythema multiforme over urticaria, and acral involvement with mucosa suggests viral or drug causes depending on context [^11413nH8] [^113RjPSJ] [^117CEA92] [^114HdsfZ].

> I will now examine the differential by morphology and distribution, but I should double-check each bucket against the history. For maculopapular eruptions, I should consider viral exanthems including COVID-19, measles, rubella, parvovirus, EBV, and HIV, as well as drug eruptions and bacterial infections like RMSF. For vesiculobullous disease, I need to distinguish varicella/zoster, HSV, autoimmune bullous disease, SJS/TEN, AGEP, and bullous impetigo. For petechial/purpuric rashes, I must prioritize meningococcemia, RMSF, vasculitis, and platelet disorders. For annular/targetoid lesions, tinea, erythema migrans, erythema multiforme, and SJS/TEN are key. For nodular or papulosquamous disease, I should consider sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, prurigo nodularis, and cutaneous metastases. And for pruritic symmetric eruptions, scabies, atopic dermatitis, and dermatitis herpetiformis rise on the list [^11413nH8] [^116TJ387] [^114qTLAM] [^113D181r] [^112AmniE] [^115hHewQ] [^112guj9N].

> But wait, what if the eruption is drug-related? I need to check timing relative to new medications, because morbilliform drug eruptions typically occur within 4 weeks, AGEP within 1–3 days of beta-lactams, SJS/TEN after 1–8 weeks, and DRESS after 2–8 weeks. I should also remember that immune checkpoint inhibitors produce heterogeneous rashes that can be morbilliform or macular and may herald more severe immune-related adverse events, so I should escalate workup if there is mucosal involvement, bullae, or systemic symptoms [^1173uPn6] [^112Zr1ED] [^112F5GuC].

> Next, I should review which tests are actually indicated and avoid low-yield testing. For suspected scabies, I should perform a careful skin exam for burrows and treat empirically if classic, because KOH is not helpful and microscopy for mites is insensitive. For tinea, KOH of scale is appropriate. For suspected RMSF or meningococcemia, I should not wait for serology and should start doxycycline or cefotaxime/ceftriaxone immediately. For suspected SJS/TEN, I should obtain urgent dermatology input and consider biopsy. For suspected AGEP, I should check CBC for neutrophilia and stop the culprit drug. For suspected syphilis, I should order RPR/TPPA and consider HIV testing. For suspected COVID-19, I should test per local protocols. And for suspected autoimmune bullous disease, I should arrange biopsy with direct immunofluorescence and serum autoantibodies [^115hHewQ] [^112jDg9H] [^113xMK7F] [^1176aEnF] [^112F5GuC] [^1173uPn6] [^116TJ387] [^114qTLAM].

> I need to ensure my initial management aligns with severity and likely etiology. For benign-appearing rashes without systemic features, supportive care with emollients, topical corticosteroids, and antipruritics is reasonable. For suspected scabies, permethrin 5% cream with attention to contacts and environment is standard. For suspected drug eruption, stop the culprit and treat symptomatically. For suspected viral exanthem, treat supportively unless a specific antiviral is indicated. For suspected AGEP, stop the drug and consider systemic corticosteroids if severe. For suspected SJS/TEN, admit, stop the drug, and initiate burn-center level care. For suspected RMSF or meningococcemia, start empiric antibiotics immediately. And for suspected syphilis, treat with benzathine penicillin G and arrange partner management [^115hHewQ] [^112jDg9H] [^1173uPn6] [^112F5GuC] [^113xMK7F].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and safety-netting. I will arrange reassessment within 24–48 hours if the diagnosis is uncertain, the patient is systemically ill, or the rash is evolving rapidly. I will counsel on red flags that require urgent return, including fever, mucosal involvement, bullae, pain out of proportion, neurologic symptoms, or bleeding. I will document morphology, distribution, and a working differential, and I will refer to dermatology for unclear diagnoses, suspected serious cutaneous adverse reactions, immunobullous disease, or persistent pruritic eruptions unresponsive to initial therapy [^11413nH8] [^112F5GuC].

> Let me reconsider a few pitfalls so I don't miss them. COVID-19 can present with urticarial, vesicular, or acral lesions and may precede or accompany systemic symptoms, so I should test when suspected. Secondary syphilis can mimic many rashes and may involve palms and soles, so a low threshold for RPR/TPPA is prudent in sexually active patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor rashes can be early harbingers of more severe immune-related adverse events, so I should escalate evaluation if morphology is atypical or systemic features emerge. And in children, I should remember that atypical distributions and linear patterns can reflect Blaschko-linear dermatoses or viral exanthems, which can guide both diagnosis and counseling [^116TJ387] [^113FnNN6] [^112Zr1ED] [^11346e9b].

A rash is a **change in skin appearance** with color, texture, or elevation, and can reflect infection, allergy, drug reaction, autoimmune disease, or systemic illness. Evaluation relies on **history, morphology, and distribution** [^113F39rh] to build a prioritized differential and guide testing and treatment [^112QSrxp]. Red flags (fever, mucosal involvement, rapid progression, immunocompromise) [^11413nH8] require **urgent care** [^1176aEnF] to exclude life-threatening causes such as SJS/TEN, meningococcemia, or RMSF [^113xMK7F]. Most rashes are benign and self-limited, but persistent, atypical, or severe cases warrant dermatology referral and possible biopsy [^112QSrxp].

---

## Clinical classification of rashes

Rashes are classified by **morphology and distribution** to streamline diagnosis and management [^11413nH8]:

| **Morphology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Maculopapular | Measles, rubella, drug eruptions, viral exanthems [^114HdsfZ] |
| Vesiculobullous | Chickenpox, herpes zoster, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, SJS/TEN [^114qTLAM] |
| Petechial/purpuric | Meningococcemia, RMSF, vasculitis, thrombocytopenia [^113D181r] |
| Urticarial | Allergic reactions, urticaria, angioedema [^117CEA92] |
| Papulosquamous | Psoriasis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea [^112AmniE] |
| Nodular | Erythema nodosum, sarcoidosis, cutaneous metastases [^notfound] |

---

## Common causes of rashes

Rashes arise from diverse **etiologies**:

- **Infectious**: Viral (measles, chickenpox, COVID-19) [^116TJ387], bacterial (RMSF, meningococcemia) [^113xMK7F], fungal (tinea) [^112AmniE], parasitic (scabies) [^115hHewQ].
- **Allergic**: Drug eruptions, contact dermatitis, urticaria [^112anRqS].
- **Autoimmune**: Psoriasis, lupus, vasculitis [^notfound].
- **Systemic diseases**: Syphilis, HIV, hepatitis, malignancy [^113FnNN6].
- **Environmental**: Heat rash, sunburn, irritant dermatitis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential: **history, morphology, and distribution** guide the differential and testing [^113F39rh]:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, pruritus, pain, fever, systemic symptoms, travel, exposures, medications, allergies, family history [^113F39rh].
- **Physical examination**: Morphology, distribution, mucosal involvement, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly [^notfound].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, serologies, cultures, skin biopsy as indicated [^115kSb2q].
- **Specialized tests**: Patch testing, immunofluorescence, molecular diagnostics [^112guj9N].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain features **warrant urgent evaluation** to exclude life-threatening disease:

- **Fever with petechiae or purpura**: Meningococcemia, RMSF, vasculitis [^113xMK7F].
- **Rapidly progressive rash with mucosal involvement**: SJS/TEN [^113JbXQJ].
- **Neurological symptoms with rash**: Meningitis, encephalitis, neurosyphilis [^116e8P3W].
- **Immunocompromised state**: Increased risk of severe infections and reactions [^notfound].
- **Severe pain or necrosis**: Necrotizing fasciitis, vasculitis [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on **etiology and severity**:

- **Supportive care**: Topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, emollients, analgesics [^113RjPSJ].
- **Specific therapies**: Antibiotics for infections, antivirals for herpes, immunosuppressants for autoimmune disease, chemotherapy for malignancy [^113FnNN6].
- **Emergency care**: Hospitalization, IV fluids, systemic corticosteroids, immunoglobulin for severe reactions [^113RjPSJ].
- **Patient education**: Avoidance of triggers, adherence to therapy, recognition of warning signs [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or severe rashes can lead to **significant morbidity**:

- **Infection**: Secondary bacterial infection, sepsis [^notfound].
- **Scarring**: Permanent disfigurement, especially with bullous or necrotic lesions [^notfound].
- **Systemic involvement**: Organ damage, particularly with vasculitis or severe drug reactions [^notfound].
- **Psychosocial impact**: Anxiety, depression, social isolation [^notfound].

---

## Prevention and patient education

Prevention focuses on **trigger avoidance**, prompt treatment of infections, and medication caution. Education should cover home care, when to seek care, and adherence to therapy [^notfound].

---

A rash is a visible skin change with a broad differential; **careful history and exam** enable accurate diagnosis and management, while red flags demand urgent care to prevent serious complications [^112QSrxp].

### Mycosis fungoides presenting as symmetric concentric patches mimicking figurate erythema [^111pjhmj]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 52-year-old white male presented to outpatient dermatology clinic for evaluation of a 4-year history of a recurrent, intermittent rash that appeared as symmetrically distributed, red annular patches on non–sun-exposed areas of his trunk and extremities. The lesions gradually expanded in concentric rings with scale over several months. The affected areas were mildly pruritic, and he experienced arthralgias with each flare. His medical history was noncontributory, and his only medication was a proton pump inhibitor, which he had been taking for many years.

At an outside facility, Lyme disease testing was negative, and he was given the initial clinical diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) and was treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, which provided only temporary improvement.

A 21-year-old man presented with a widespread, intensely pruritic skin rash, which developed acutely 5 days after returning from a backpacking holiday in Thailand. On initial presentation to his general practitioner, an erythematous, papular rash was noted in the upper right back, with smaller clusters of lesions on the buttocks and right arm. Based on the anatomical distribution of the lesions, a preliminary diagnosis of shingles was made. Over the following 2 weeks, the lesions failed to improve, and new snake-like lesions appeared. A dermatologist made the diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans. The skin lesions rapidly resolved following oral albendazole therapy.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

Question 3: Which of the following features of the patient's presentation is most classic for this eruption?
A. Onset of rash after receiving piperacillin-tazobactam
B. Location on the extremities
C. Pruritus
D. Absence of fever
E. Leukocytosis

Answer:
A. Onset of rash after receiving piperacillin-tazobactam – Incorrect. ALEP tends to occur within 2 weeks of drug exposure and as quickly as 1 day with repeat medication exposure. The patient received piperacillin-tazobactam 13 days prior to the eruption's onset, while ampicillin was administered 3 days prior. Therefore, the most probable culprit for the patient's presentation is ampicillin.
B. Location on the extremities – Incorrect. ALEP has been reported to most frequently occur on the face, trunk, and upper limbs, in descending order.
C. Pruritus – Correct. Itching or burning sensation is a typical presenting feature of ALEP.
D. Absence of fever – Incorrect. Patients with ALEP may or may not present with fever. In a systematic review, 47.6% of patients with ALEP presented with fever.
E. Leukocytosis – Incorrect. Our patient presented without a leukocytosis, which is typical of ALEP as only 33.3% of patients may present with leukocytosis. Laboratory workup in ALEP is generally within normal limits.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

Scabies — presentation and exam considerations note that infestation 'usually manifests as a generalized or regional pruritic papular rash with erythema, abundant excoriations, and secondarily infected pustules' and 'generally presents in a regionally symmetric manner'. 'For example, 2 of the most commonly involved sites are the volar wrists and finger web spaces; the left and right sides are usually involved in a nearly identical fashion'. 'Also, boys and men with scabies often develop nodular lesions on the scrotum and penis', and 'When considering scabies in any male older than 2 years, a genital examination can be extremely helpful'. 'Scabies burrows are short, delicate, linear lesions that involve the most superficial part of the epidermis; burrows are pathognomonic but are challenging to detect', and treatment information is available at 'https://www.cdc.gov/scabies/about/'.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^1117LNtj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

A 30-year-old man presented with multiple, bilaterally symmetrical, erythematous papular-vesicular lesions distributed over his neck, anterior trunk, posterior trunk, and upper arms (Figures 1 and 2). Face, mucosa, and lower limbs were spared. The skin lesions were mildly pruritic, appeared 4 days after the onset of fever, cough, and malaise. He had a history of varicella in childhood. His complete blood count, liver and kidney parameters, and C‐reactive protein were within normal limits. IgM antibodies were negative for varicella infection. Tzanck smear, carried out from a vesicle, showed many acantholytic cells with lymphocytes. Giant cells suggestive of herpes simplex virus infections were not found (Figure 3). SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab showed COVID-19 positivity. A diagnosis of varicella-like exanthem secondary to COVID-19 was made. The patient was advised home isolation and managed conservatively. The patient's skin and systemic symptoms subsided within 1 week.

The vesicular lesions in COVID-19 are uncommon, typically seen in middle-aged patients, associated with intermediately severe disease. The prevalence of vesicular rash ranges from 3.77% to 15% in this disease. The cytokine storm secondary to immune hyperresponse, and direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelium of dermal blood vessels, may form the pathophysiological basis of vesicular lesions.

### Cutaneous eruption associated with (group C) bacteremia [^116KW56N]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome and gout presented to a dermatology clinic with a 2-day history of a new rash. The rash first appeared on his buttocks and spread to his thighs. It was pruritic and nontender. The only new medication exposure was a short course of indomethacin 3 weeks before presentation. The patient denied new exposures, travel, or new contactants. A review of his medical records indicated he had a productive cough for a week that prompted his primary care physician to obtain a chest x-ray, the findings from which were normal. Physical examination showed symmetric, well-demarcated, and erythematous plaques on his buttocks and thighs bilaterally. Drug reaction was less likely given the lack of truncal involvement. There was no pain or rubor suggestive of cellulitis. A diagnosis of contact dermatitis was favored given the bilateral and symmetric distribution and pruritus. He was instructed to use emollients and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, as well as hydroxyzine for the itch.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Black-spot toxicodendron dermatitis with varied presentation [^111FtELz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article describes the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and treatment of 2 unrelated cases with different presentations of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis. In the first case, a healthy 7-y-old male presented with a rash consisting of black dots with localized surrounding erythema on the left arm. The rash then progressed to a vesicular, pinpoint, raised rash spreading to the face, arms, and neck. In the second case, a 4-y-old male presented with non-pruritic, black, flat, non-erythematous lesions that did not progress. This patient's older sibling had been diagnosed with poison ivy 1 wk prior, and they attended the same child care where the poison ivy was thought to be acquired. In both cases, diagnosis of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis was made. The black spot of Toxicodendron dermatitis is caused by urushiol oxidation on exposure to air. The subject may or may not go on to develop allergic contact dermatitis after the exposure. Diagnosis of this dermatitis is made on clinical presentation, with careful consideration of history, distribution, and lesion morphology. When allergic dermatitis does develop as in the first case, systemic treatment with oral steroids is recommended. In both of these cases the black dots completely resolved in 2 to 3 wk. Dermatologic referral for dermoscopy and biopsy may be necessary if the dermatosis does not resolve as anticipated.

### Neurosyphilis mimicking connective tissue disease [^113FnNN6]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A male in his 60s developed a pruritic, maculopapular rash on his torso and arms, sparing his palms and soles. He tested positive for ANA and an initial skin biopsy identified "bullous lupus", supporting the diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. Additional symptoms included headaches, facial nerve palsy and hearing loss, which partially responded to oral corticosteroids. He subsequently developed a steroid-dependent left eye scotoma, neuroretinitis and optic nerve papillitis. Mycophenolate mofetil was added but an attempted oral steroid taper led to a worsening rash, progressive retinitis and papillitis. Neurosyphilis was confirmed by serum positive rapid plasma reagin test, reactive treponema pallidum antibodies, positive cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory and positive spirochete immunostain of skin biopsy of lesional (rash) tissue. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone resolved his rash and visual symptoms. It is important to consider syphilis as a mimicker of connective tissue diseases.

### A rare case of cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis in an adult patient [^113gQpWs]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Kuo et alrecently published a case of cutaneous only Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in an adult. We are aware of very few published cases of this clinical presentation. Here, we describe one such case in a 62-year-old adult male.

A 62-year-old man with a history of intellectual disability presented to our clinic with a progressively diffuse pruritic rash that started 3 years prior. Despite previous treatments for allergic contact dermatitis and tinea corporis using topical corticosteroids and antifungals, the rash remained unimproved. Physical examination revealed circular follicular accentuated erythematous plaques and erythematous annular plaques on the scalp, chest, upper arms, dorsal hands, abdomen, inguinal folds, buttocks, and bilateral thighs (Fig 1). Since the patient was nonverbal, his sister and caregiver acted as the historian. Subsequently, biopsies were performed at 2 different sites due to concerns for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Fig 2).

Fig 1
Initial visit. A, Right leg, (B) torso and upper extremities, (C) left lateral torso/arm, and (D) right lateral torso/arm.

Fig 2
Second visit 1 Month later. A, Left hip (biopsy site), (B) left abdomen (biopsy site), (C) left anterior thigh, and (D) back.

Dermatopathology findings indicated a dense inflammatory infiltrate within the dermis, extending focally around deep vessels (Fig 3). Additionally, an increased number of lymphocytes, histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and numerous "bean-shaped" histiocytoid cells were noted. These cells stained positive for S-100 and CD1a, while CD-3 and CD-20 stains demonstrated a mixture of T and B cells. A CD-30 stain highlighted rare cells within the infiltrate. Collectively, these findings supported a diagnosis of LCH.

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^112Zr1ED]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

ICI-exanthem

ICI-exanthem is a common specific D-irAE that typically presents early in the ICI treatment course. Although there is some ambiguity in the name of this entity, the development of a type IV hypersensitivity (commonly manifested as an exanthematous/morbilliform drug rash) implies unique immunologic pathways that warrant a specific morphologic diagnosis.

ICI-exanthem often presents with itching, but burning has been reported and some cases can be asymptomatic. ICI-exanthem can be classified into two morphologic subtypes based on the panel's experience: (1) morbilliform, characterized by erythematous papules (3–4 mm) that may coalesce into plaques on the torso, extremities, and less commonly the face; (2) macular erythema, which involves geographic erythematous patches or thin scaly erythematous plaques. Later in the course of an ICI-exanthem, superficial desquamation is often present.

Notably, ICI-exanthem can precede more severe D-irAEs. As such, if patients who have been diagnosed with ICI-exanthem develop systemic symptoms, bullous lesions, or mucosal involvement, revision in D-irAE diagnostic category should be considered (online supplemental table S11).

The proposed workup for ICI-exanthem includes the standard D-irAE evaluation. Diagnostic evaluation for ICI-exanthem commonly includes an FSE by a BCD and may include biopsies in cases without classic features or where there is morphologic overlap with other specific D-irAEs. Laboratory studies may be done to rule out systemic hypersensitivity.

Consensus by expert panel adjudication was reached for the morphologic subtypes of ICI-exanthem (median: 8, range 5–9), the symptoms (median: 8, range 7–9), the supportive examination findings (median: 8, range 7–9), labs/imaging (median: 8, range 6–9), diagnostic criteria accuracy (median: 8, range 3–9), and usability (median: 8, range 3–9) (online supplemental table S12).

rashListen to pronunciationAn area of the skin that has changes in texture or color and may look inflamed or irritated. The skin may be red, warm, scaly, bumpy, dry, itchy, swollen, or painful. It may also crack or blister. A rash can occur in one area of the body or all over the body and may look very different depending on the cause. It may be a sign of a specific medical condition or a side effect of a medicine or treatment. Some causes of skin rashes include allergies, infection, heat, and immune system disorders.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A 54-year-old woman presented with pruritic rash and hives of 3days' duration followed by shortness of breath for 1day. SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 include acral lesions, urticarial rash, erythematous maculopapular rash, vascular rashes and vesicular rash. The cutaneous manifestations are mostly described as self-limiting. Urticarial rashes are not reported as the initial presentation symptom of COVID-19 infection but mostly noted to occur at the same time or after the onset of non-cutaneous symptoms. Management of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 affecting quality of life has not been well studied. Antihistamine therapy is the primary recommended therapy. Role of antiviral therapy for severe cases of rash needs to be further assessed.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Maculopapular rash

Twenty seven (13.7%) participants reported an erythematous maculopapular rash of varying distribution and rapid onset, separate to areas of blistering or pustules. One of these participants had positive syphilis serology (n = 4 unknown).

One participant, a 36-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load < 200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count > 400 cells/μL), reported a rapidly progressive maculopapular rash soon after developing perianal vesicles.

The vesicles initially progressed into three pruritic, pustular, perianal lesions. On day 4 the patient presented to the sexual health service with rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and difficulty defecating. He was treated empirically for proctitis with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and aciclovir 400 mg three times daily. On day 6 the patient awoke to a widespread symmetrical, pruritic maculopapular rash across his torso, back, legs, and buttocks, and reported inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 6; also see supplementary figure 6). He denied any fever or systemic features. Results for herpes simplex virus, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis (3 in 1 sampling) and T pallidum were negative. By day 8 the perianal lesions had begun to crust over, tenesmus had improved, and the rash had started to diminish.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^111FfNh2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The rash usually appears 3 days after the onset of systemic symptoms and disappears by 8 days. The characteristic features of this vesicular exanthem are mild/absent pruritus, frequent trunk involvement, small size, scattered distribution of lesions, and heals without scar. Two morphological patterns of this rash are 1) widespread polymorphic pattern — more common, consisting of small papules, vesicles, and pustules, and 2) localized pattern — less prevalent, consisting of monomorphic lesions over anterior or posterior trunk.

The histology shows dyskeratosis, ballooning multinucleated cells, and scanty necrotic keratinocytes with lymphocytic satellitosis. Dermal and vessel wall edema, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and red blood cells (RBCs) extravasation are the other findings seen.

Varicella-like exanthem is a COVID-19-specific rash whose identification is helpful in the clinical diagnosis.

A 35 6 or 7-week diamniotic dichorionic twin admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress presented at day 2 of life with an erythematous papulovesicular rash involving her right leg. On days 3 to 4, the rash spread to the right thigh, foot, and toes, in a linear pattern following the lines of Blaschko with overlying scale and erosions (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Her fraternal twin brother presented with no similar findings and there was no family history of any similar rash. A viral swab was performed from vesicular fluid and negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) by polymerase chain reaction. A punch biopsy was taken. There were no other systemic abnormalities on presentation.

Question 1: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Incontinentia pigmenti
B. HSV
C. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN)
D. Lichen striatus
E. Linear porokeratosis

Answers:
A. Incontinentia pigmenti – Incorrect. Incontinentia pigmenti, is a congenital X-linked dominant condition, which is characterized by 4 stages. The first vesiculobullous stage, lasting days to weeks, presents erythematous vesicles in a linear distribution on torso/extremities. Although some neonatal cases note neurological or ophthalmological abnormalities, this patient had no systemic findings such as seizures or family history of rash.
B. HSV – Incorrect. HSV typically presents as grouped erythematous vesicles, not linear lesions in a Blaschkoid pattern. Additionally, the HSV polymerase chain reaction was negative, making this an unlikely diagnosis.
C. ILVEN – Correct. ILVEN is a rare variant of an epidermal nevus is typically seen in early childhood, but can occasionally present at birth. Lesions are typically pruritic, erythematous, verrucous papules, and plaques in a linear distribution following the lines of Blaschko, but can present as vesicles at early presentation.
D. Lichen striatus – Incorrect. Lichen striatus presents as flat-topped flesh-colored or hypopigmented papules along the lines of Blaschko. Lesions typically do not present at birth, but typically presents between 4 months and 15 years of life.
E. Linear porokeratosis – Incorrect. Linear porokeratosis commonly appears on the extremities as unilateral hyperkeratotic papules in a linear pattern along the lines of Blaschko. Lesions usually present at early childhood.

### Grover' s-like drug eruption in a patient with metastatic melanoma under ipilimumab therapy [^112YjrBv]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent years have witnessed a breakthrough in the therapy of advanced melanoma. Ipilimumab, a fully humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting the immunological checkpoint surface molecule cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), has been shown to improve the overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma in clinical trials. Dermatologic toxicity is a common drug-related adverse event associated with this treatment. Approximately half of the patients treated with ipilimumab will experience rash and/or pruritus. For most patients, dermatologic toxicity is the earliest detectable immune-related adverse event, with average onset at 3.6 weeks after the initiation of immunotherapy. Typical macroscopic findings include polymorphic, reticular, maculopapular, faintly erythematous rashes on the trunk or extremities and vitiligo. Histologically, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates consisting of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T-cells with a concomitant infiltrate of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells have been observed indicating a partial breach of tolerance to normal skin.

### Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification [^115ay2TM]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The earliest skin abnormalities consist of a small erythematous macule, which rapidly develops into an urticarial papule. Small vesicles appear that may rupture, dry and form scabs. The predominant symptoms are intense itching and burning. The rash has a characteristic symmetrical distribution. The elbows and upper forearms are affected in more than 90% of patients. Other sites commonly involved are the buttocks, knees, shoulders, sacrum, face, scalp, neck and trunk. The rash may be widespread, but can be limited to one or two sites. Once the rash appears, it is an ongoing problem in most patients, but it can run an intermittent course in 10% of cases. Only a minority of patients, about 10%, have gastrointestinal symptoms and these are usually mild. However, celiac-type villous atrophy in the upper small intestinal mucosa is found in 65% to 75% of patients with DH. Even in patients with apparently normal biopsies, subtle changes in the mucosa, such as an increased number of IELs, indicate gluten sensitization. A celiac-type pattern of autoantibodies (anti-tTG, anti-EMA and anti-DGP antibodies) is usually found in the serum of patients with DH. Likewise, DH patients may show the same array of manifestations, associated disorders and complications as in patients with CD (autoimmune diseases, iron-deficient anemia, osteoporosis and malignancy).

The diagnosis of DH rests on the demonstration of IgA in uninvolved skin on biopsies analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. The most common site is in the dermal papillae, where IgA is detected as granular or fibrillar deposits. IgA may also be laid down in a linear granular fashion along the line of the basement membrane. It is important that this pattern is differentiated from homogeneous linear IgA deposition found in linear IgA disease, which is not gluten dependent. Diagnosis of DH is based on skin biopsy and serological evidence of celiac-type autoimmunity. Since DH is the cutaneous counterpart of CD ('skin CD'), a proven diagnosis of DH in a patient should be taken as indirect evidence for the presence of small bowel damage. Accordingly, a duodenal biopsy is unnecessary in DH patients.

After establishing a diagnosis of DH, GFD implementation should be recommended, even when the small intestinal mucosa appears normal (as is the case in potential CD), because the rash of DH is gluten sensitive.

### Linear darier disease after COVID-19 infection [^115tsBgu]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Darier disease, also named Darier-White disease and keratosis follicularis, is an inherited skin disease that commonly presents in childhood but can present later in life. Clinically, disease is characterized by multiple brown keratotic papules coalescing into greasy plaques in the seborrheic distribution/areas of the body. Lesions are histologically characterized as acantholytic dyskeratosis with associated hyperkeratosis. Most cases first appear between ages 6 and 20 years old and clinically present in a generalized and symmetric distribution, but approximately 10% of patients present with localized disease described as segmental, unilateral, linear, or zosteriform. Here, we discuss a case of a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a linear truncal rash after hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. While COVID-19 vaccination has been reported to precipitate Darier disease, Darier disease after natural COVID-19 infection has not been previously published.

### Erythema multiforme: recognition and management [^115rcjbq]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on erythema multiforme:

- **Definition**: Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by the presence of distinctive target lesions on the skin (primarily in acral regions) and/or mucous membranes.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology of erythema multiforme is not fully understood, but it is believed to be an immune reaction triggered by various factors. Infections, particularly HSV, are the most common triggers. Other viruses, such as HCV, Coxsackievirus, and EBV, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, certain medications, and vaccines have also been implicated.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of erythema multiforme is believed to be 0.01–1% annually, most commonly affecting individuals aged 18–30 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for erythema multiforme include infections, especially HSV, and exposure to certain medications. However, in many cases, no specific trigger or risk factor can be identified.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, erythema multiforme presents with symmetrically distributed target lesions on the extremities and trunk. These lesions are characterized by concentric zones of color change. The severity of erythema multiforme can vary widely, from mild forms with only skin involvement to severe forms that affect multiple mucous membranes and can be life-threatening.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for erythema multiforme is generally favorable. Most cases are self-limiting and resolve within weeks to months without long-term complications.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^112Cg6RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

### Mogamulizumab-associated rash during treatment of mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome… [^117FqQUh]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This case series found that mogamulizumab-associated rash had a heterogeneous clinical presentation with variable and delayed onset in patients with MF or SS. Mogamulizumab-associated rash exhibited a predilection for the head and neck and was difficult to clinically distinguish from relapse or progression of disease. Recognition of the most common clinical presentations can help prevent unnecessary discontinuation of mogamulizumab treatment. The presence of MAR does not necessitate permanent discontinuation of or avoidance of retreatment with mogamulizumab. In the ATLL population, rash develops most commonly between cycles 4 and 8 of mogamulizumab treatment. 10–12. The most common anatomical region involved by MAR was the head and neck, with a striking and unique involvement of the scalp in most patients, followed by involvement of the trunk, arms, and legs.

because of global clinical remission; disease progression; and change of systemic management to methotrexate to treat MAR and MF or SS. In this single-institution case series of 19 patients with MF or SS treated with mogamulizumab, MAR was observed in 33% of patients, mostly in the patients with SS, and demonstrated heterogeneous features, including diverse clinical presentation with delayed onset and persistent course. Time to onset of MAR can be weeks to even months after drug therapy discontinuation. Unique to MAR is that nearly all patients exhibit involvement of hair-bearing areas of the scalp. In some of these cases, the head and neck–predominant presentation was distinct from the patient's original disease morphologic and anatomical distribution, enabling astute clinical recognition of MAR as confirmed by histopathologic analysis and TCR clonality studies.

As seen in this study, MAR presents as a heterogeneous skin eruption that is crucial to recognize and distinguish from relapse or progression of disease in patients with MF or SS. No life-threatening drug-induced events were observed, and mogamulizumab therapy continuation and retreatment may be considered in the appropriate clinical context. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the pathogenesis of MAR, and determine implications of MAR on prognosis regarding disease response to mogamulizumab.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis: an update on diagnosis and management [^112guj9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation, Sex, and Age at Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The clinical picture of DH consists of an itchy rash occurring in the favored sites of the elbows, the extensor surfaces of the forearms, the knees, and the buttocks, including the sacral area (Fig. 1). The rash is polymorphic, consisting of small blisters, papules, and erythema; however, because of the intense itch and associated scratching, erosions, crusts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often dominate the clinical picture. The localization of the rash is so typical for DH that the itchy rash in the predominant skin sites usually raises suspicion of DH. However, the severity of the rash varies between individuals, and a more intense rash may also affect other sites, such as the scalp, face, and upper back. The clinical picture and severity of the DH rash seem to have remained unchanged over recent decades without becoming milder or otherwise nonclassical as seen in celiac disease. The itch in DH is very prominent; in half of the patients, it is a constant finding and correlates with common sleep disturbances. Triggering factors such as taking indomethacin and inadvertent dietary iodide ingestion are known to exacerbate the rash and itching. A few cases of localized DH on the face or elsewhere on the body have been described. Acral purpura is a rare finding in DH and may be seen either with the typical rash or as the only symptom of the disease, especially in children with DH.

Dermatitis herpetiformis lesions on the a elbows and b knees: observe symmetrical distribution and erosions due to scratching. c A close-up view of a small blister. d Direct immunofluorescence finding of uninvolved skin showing pathognomonic granular immunoglobulin A deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction

The differential diagnosis of DH includes various itchy, excoriated, and blistering skin diseases. Linear IgA disease and sometimes bullous pemphigoid may clinically resemble DH, but immunofluorescence examination easily differentiates these disorders. Other itchy skin diseases, such as scabies, atopic and nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, and urticaria may also resemble DH, but the most obvious difference is the symmetrical distribution of the rash on the favored sites in DH.

History was notable for remote travel to Mexico and the Philippines. The patient was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States 30 years ago. The review of systems was negative for weight loss, night sweats, cough, fever, shortness of breath, skin pain, or sensory changes to the involved skin. Past medical history was unremarkable. No new medications were started prior to the onset of the rash. Physical examination noted numerous edematous pink papules and plaques of the trunk, face, arms, and legs. Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen showed extensive granulomatous dermal inflammation (Fig 3).

### Diffuse pustules overlying brightly erythematous plaques in skin of color [^1173uPn6]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Miliaria pustulosa
B. Bacterial folliculitis
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms

Answers:
A. Miliaria pustulosa – Incorrect. Although miliaria pustulosa can present with pinpoint pustules overlying erythematous patches or plaques, miliaria pustulosa often favors flexural, intertriginous areas; in contrast, this patient presented with a much more diffuse eruption covering the neck, trunk, and extremities with no clear predilection for areas prone to occlusion and hyperhidrosis. Furthermore, the patient did not report intense pruritus or stinging characteristic of miliaria pustulosa.
B. Bacterial folliculitis – Incorrect. Bacterial folliculitis presents with isolated, follicular-based papules or pustules, which is inconsistent with the clustered, nonfollicular pustules observed in this patient. Furthermore, the negative wound culture decreases likelihood of a bacterial etiology.
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) – Correct. AGEP is a rare pustular severe cutaneous adverse reaction classically triggered by beta-lactam antibiotics, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which the patient had taken 3 days before eruption's onset. The timeline of the rash and fever, the eruption of small, nonfollicular pustules overlying erythematous plaques, the lack of mucosal involvement, the neutrophilia on laboratory, and the spongiosis with papillary edema on pathology are characteristic of AGEP.
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by targetoid lesions, bullae formation, full-thickness epidermal necrosis, and mucosal and ocular involvement, which were not seen in this patient.
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms – Incorrect. Pustules are rarely observed in DRESS. Although the patient had autoimmune hepatitis at baseline, she did not have new or worsening internal organ involvement as is commonly observed in DRESS. In terms of timeline, symptoms of DRESS typically develop 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of the offending drug, in contrast to the acute onset in this patient.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis — age at onset and lesion burden: Most adult patients develop mastocytosis between 20 to 35 years of age, and in some cases the first lesions even appear after the age of 65 to 70 years; lesion counts vary widely from fewer than 10 lesions to almost universal coverage, lesions often start on the thigh, axilla, or lower trunk then spread over several years, and facial skin is typically spared.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^115rqsu6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
D. Coxsackie A infection
E. Herpes zoster infection

Answers:
A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herpes zoster is a reactivation of the latent VZV, this typically presents with a dermatomal, unilateral vesicular eruption associated with pain, including sensations of burning and tingling.

### Segmental prurigo pigmentosa [^1163gSMH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Prurigo pigmentosa (PP) is an inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. The skin lesions in PP are symmetrically distributed on the back, chest, and neck. Pruritus is a prominent feature in many cases. We report on a 13-year-old girl with lesions typical of PP in a segmental arrangement on her left chest. A segmental distribution of PP has not been previously reported.

### Erythema multiforme [^114T2KBv]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a skin condition considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to infections or drugs. It consists of a polymorphous eruption of macules, papules, and characteristic "target" lesions that are symmetrically distributed with a propensity for the distal extremities. There is minimal mucosal involvement. Management involves treating the existing infectious agent or discontinuing the causal drug. Mild cases resolve without sequelae and do not require treatment. Recurrent cases have been prevented with continuous acyclovir. Patients who have no response to acyclovir may have a response to valacyclovir or famcilovir, which have greater oral bioavailability and more convenient dosing. Patients with recurrent erythema multiforme despite suppressive antiviral therapy should be referred to a dermatologist for further treatment.

### Toxic exanthems in the adult population [^115Cwa1N]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Frequently the internist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting process, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and complete physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of systems can help guide laboratory testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem.

### Travel-associated skin disease [^115kSb2q]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Travel associated skin disease is extremely common and a frequent cause of the returning traveller seeking medical attention. Widespread cutaneous eruptions usually represent reactive rashes, indicating an underlying systemic infection or allergic reaction. Patients with disseminated or spreading rashes following travel often present with fever and malaise. In contrast, those presenting with localised skin disease such as a blister, nodule, plaque, ulcer etc are usually well in themselves but have sustained a bite/sting/penetrating injury or introduction of infection directly into the skin at the affected site. As a general rule widespread rashes are investigated with blood tests/serology and localised lesions with a skin biopsy for culture and histology.

A 70-year-old man was admitted to our COVID-19 ward with thoracalgia, productive mucus cough, fatigue and erythematous–violaceous macules on the inner side of feet and interdigital regions. The patient was started on oxygen and dexamethasone. On the day of discharge, he maintained the skin changes despite the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. A 57-year-old woman initially presented with diffuse urticarial rash on the cervical and chest region. Oral cetirizine was started, and pruritus improved. Thirty days after the discharge, the patient maintained the rash, but without pruritus. A 49-year-old man was admitted with thoracalgia, shortness of breath, dry cough and urticarial rash on the cervical and chest region. The patient was treated with cetirizine. The pruritus improved, and 5 days after discharge, the urticarial areas completely disappeared.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^114HdsfZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral exanthems typically involve similar locations to high-risk drug eruptions, including involvement of the hands, feet, face, and buttocks. Features, including brighter erythema and less pruritus, are typically associated with viral eruptions but can be difficult to quantify. The primary differentiator of viral and drug eruptions is typically location, with acral, facial, and gluteal involvement all associated with viral eruptions. Seasonality should also be considered; viral eruptions more commonly occur in the spring and summer. Finally, systemic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, cough, headache, irritability, and vomiting are more frequently seen in viral eruptions, but can precede the rash by weeks.

Once a high-risk identification has been made and after evaluating for potential SCARs, evaluation of viral causes should be considered. Additional workup should be tailored on the basis of clinical suspicion. For instance, a respiratory panel should be ordered if upper respiratory tract infection symptoms are present. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis warrant specific testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Arthralgias should prompt workup for parvovirus B19 and, in patients with the appropriate travel history, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus. Acral and oral involvement should raise suspicion for enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and echovirus. Finally, those who are underimmunized or unimmunized should be tested for measles and rubella viruses. Viral testing is of particular importance if the virus in question, such as HIV, affects patient outcomes. Other laboratory values, such as skin or serum cytokines, are not clinically useful to differentiate viral from other causes of drug eruptions at this time. Because the histopathology of viral eruptions can be nonspecific, skin biopsy is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Rash associated with pregabalin use [^115AKvbU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of extensive rash induced by orally administered pregabalin in a patient with neuropathic pain.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old white female with a diffuse, erythematous, maculopapular rash localized to her back and extremities presented to the preoperative holding area for planned exploratory nerve surgery. Prior to presentation, she had been receiving oral pregabalin 50 mg 3 times a day for approximately 2 weeks to treat her neuropathy. Prior to pregabalin therapy, the patient indicated that she had taken gabapentin for approximately 3 weeks for the pain, but had discontinued it due to adverse effects and perceived lack of efficacy. Pregabalin was discontinued and diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone were given to treat the rash. The rash almost completely resolved one week after pregabalin was discontinued.

Discussion

Pregabalin-induced rash was rarely reported in Phase 3 trials, and a clinical description of such events has not been published. Pregabalin exhibits pharmacokinetics different from those of most other antiepileptic agents. Presently, there are no clear mechanisms known for rash associated with pregabalin. The Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the development of rash and use of pregabalin by our patient.

Conclusions

There are currently no other available reports of the development of a rash coinciding with the use of pregabalin. As both Food and Drug Administration-approved and off-label use of this drug increases, further consideration of risk factors associated with the development of rash is needed.

### Skin manifestations in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116ddtCN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a well established respiratory tract illness. Recent studies in adults and children have shown an increasing number of patients reporting polymorphic cutaneous manifestations during COVID-19, including different types of rashes, from maculopapular, vascular, vesicular to atypical forms.

Recent Findings

Although pathogenesis of skin manifestations is still not fully understood, it has been proposed that cutaneous involvement during COVID-19 may be the results of the activation of the immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the reactivation or co-infection of herpesviruses or drug hypersensitivity.

Summary

According to available literature, skin manifestations in patients with COVID-19 may be categorized on the basis of their clinical presentations as follows: erythematous rashes, lesions of vascular origin, vesicular rash, urticarial rash and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme and other polymorphic erythema/atypical reactions. Prompt recognition of these cutaneous manifestations represents a crucial point to facilitate diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis: an update on diagnosis and management [^1117zYyY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), presenting with an intense itch and blistering symmetrical rash, typically on the elbows, knees, and buttocks, is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Though overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, three-fourths of patients with DH have villous atrophy in the small bowel, and the rest have celiac-type inflammatory changes. DH affects mostly adults and slightly more males than females. The mean age at onset is about 50 years. DH diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the papillary dermis. The DH autoantigen, transglutaminase 3, is deposited at the same site in tightly bound immune complexes. At present, the DH-to-celiac disease prevalence is 1:8. The incidence of DH is decreasing, whereas that of celiac disease is increasing, probably because of improved diagnostics. In DH, the treatment of choice for all patients is a gluten-free diet (GFD) in which uncontaminated oats are allowed. At onset, most patients need additional dapsone to rapidly control the rash and itching. Dapsone can be stopped after a mean of 2 years, and a strict lifelong GFD alone is required. Dietary adherence offers an excellent long-term prognosis for patients with DH, with a normal quality of life and all-cause mortality.

### A flexural exanthem following postexposure prophylaxis [^112WJTme]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical findings

A 26‐year‐old man presented as an emergency with a 24‐h history of a rapidly progressive, pruritic, painful rash. He had no relevant medical or dermatological history and took no regular medications. Two days previously, he had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse, and the following day, had attended a rapid‐access sexual health clinic. Following assessment, he was given postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV, comprising combination tenofovir and emtricitabine. Two hours following the first dose, the patient developed bilateral axillary pruritus. He had not taken any other medications or recreational drugs for 12 weeks prior to presentation, and had not taken PEP previously. He rapidly developed a widespread symmetrical erythematous tender rash, with a predilection for flexural sites (axillae/groin/buttocks/dorsal ankles) (Fig. 1a, b).

### Erythema multiforme: recognition and management [^113RjPSJ]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated reaction that involves the skin and sometimes the mucosa. Classically described as target-like, the erythema multiforme lesions can be isolated, recurrent, or persistent. Most commonly, the lesions of erythema multiforme present symmetrically on the extremities (especially on extensor surfaces) and spread centripetally. Infections, especially herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and medications constitute most of the causes of erythema multiforme; immunizations and autoimmune diseases have also been linked to erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme can be differentiated from urticaria by the duration of individual lesions. Erythema multiforme lesions are typically fixed for a minimum of seven days, whereas individual urticarial lesions often resolve within one day. Erythema multiforme can be confused with the more serious condition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome; however, Stevens-Johnson syndrome usually contains widespread erythematous or purpuric macules with blisters. The management of erythema multiforme involves symptomatic treatment with topical steroids or antihistamines and treating the underlying etiology, if known. Recurrent erythema multiforme associated with the herpes simplex virus should be treated with prophylactic antiviral therapy. Severe mucosal erythema multiforme can require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and repletion of electrolytes.

### Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem in association with coronavirus disease 2019 [^112kC3Ad]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given the right-sided predominance and flexural distribution, this rash is most consistent with a unilateral laterothoracic exanthem (UTLE). UTLE is typically characterized by a unilateral, periflexural exanthema that often involves the axillae and spreads to the contralateral side over time. Individual cases of UTLE in association with Epstein Barr virus and parvovirus B19 have been reported.UTLE is typically preceded by nonspecific systemic symptoms, including low-grade fever, diarrhea, or rhinitis. Although most often seen in children, UTLE can affect adults.

The differential diagnosis in this patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection included viral exanthema and exanthematous drug eruption. However, UTLE has not been associated with medications. Although acetaminophen is a rare cause of exanthematous drug eruptions, the time course of this eruption after 2 days of medication administration and resolution while on acetaminophen would be exceedingly quick. The morphology of the rash could be consistent with symmetric drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema but the patient's rash improved while she was on acetaminophen, making this diagnosis much less likely. Many cases of UTLE are initially mistaken for contact dermatitis because of the unusual distribution. Pathology of UTLE is nonspecific, similar to viral exanthem and exanthematous drug eruption, and typically shows mild spongiosis with variable lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates. UTLE typically self-resolves with supportive care within 3 to 6 weeks without recurrence.

### Lack of classic histology should not prevent diagnosis of necrolytic acral erythema [^113CKCcq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a patient who was referred for management of psoriasis unresponsive to treatment. Given the predominantly acral distribution of the patient's rash and his known diagnosis of hepatitis C, we considered the diagnosis of necrolytic acral erythema (NAE) and empirically began treatment with oral zinc sulfate. At follow-up 3 weeks later, the patient had exceptional improvement in his cutaneous disease, supporting our diagnosis of NAE. NAE is a recently described entity, and limited information is known regarding its etiology and pathogenesis; however, previous reports have been fairly consistent regarding the clinical and histopathologic presentation. We describe a patient without the classic histologic or clinical findings of previously described cases of NAE. We believe that it is important to keep the diagnosis of NAE in one's differential for a predominantly acrally distributed rash. Furthermore, we recommend additional work-up, including hepatitis C status and zinc levels, as well as possible treatment with oral zinc sulfate in patients with a potential diagnosis of NAE.

### Prurigo nodularis in a 9-year-old girl [^1122jWLC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old African-American female with a known history of atopic dermatitis presented for evaluation of an intensely pruritic nodular rash on both upper and lower extremities, buttocks, and lower abdomen for more than 1 year. The patient had been treated with several medium-potency topical steroids and antipruritics without appreciable improvement. After considering and excluding other differential diagnoses, the diagnosis of prurigo nodularis (PN) in association with atopic dermatitis was made. Prurigo nodularis usually occurs in middle-aged and older persons and is rarely seen in the pediatric population. The onset of PN in the case presented is considerably earlier than what has been described in literature. The etiology of the disorder is unknown. The management of prurigo nodularis is usually challenging for both patients and treating physicians. Frequently, combinations of several medications or modalities are used in an attempt to control disease activity. Overall, PN is a benign condition in children, particularly when it is associated with atopic dermatitis. It does not increase mortality; however, it can cause significant morbidity in untreated patients.

### Nodular mucinosis misdiagnosed as non-responsive secondary syphilis [^111iwYKJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 24-year-old man presented with an erythematous, non-pruritic and painless papulonodular skin rash affecting the trunk, upper arms (excluding palms), neck, face, forehead and scalp. He had a penile ulcer for the past 2weeks, almost healed at the time of observation. The patient tested positive for syphilis and HIV-1; he claimed being negative for HIV 6months earlier. As the palms were not affected, we performed a skin biopsy for the differential diagnosis between secondary lues and acute HIV seroconversion reaction. Benzathine penicillin (2,400,000 units) was administrated and antiretroviral therapy started. Although the skin biopsy was compatible with secondary syphilis, there was no change in the skin rash 3weeks after the first penicillin administration. Another 2 doses of penicillin were given but 4weeks later the rash persisted. A second biopsy revealed a mucinous skin infiltration, compatible with nodular mucinosis.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^112F5GuC]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Skin toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any skin-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

For patients with pruritus without rash, treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids and GABA agonists may be considered (LE: 4).
Workup for patients with potential ICI-related rash (grade < 3) should include CBC with differential, CMP, assessment of the percentage body surface area involved by the rash, assessment of special features (eg, bullous formation, mucosal involvement), and patient history of allergy or atopy. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered.
Workup for patients with potential ICI-related rash (grade ≥ 3) should also include referral to a dermatologist and possible skin biopsy.
Rash with blisters, mucosal involvement, or bullous formation should trigger suspicion of lichenoid rash, pemphigus, pemphigoid, or SJS/TEN and follow-up testing, including skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence studies and serum antibodies to desmogleins 1 and 3, bullous pemphigoid antigens 1 and 2, and indirect immunofluorescence studies in salt-split skin. ICI therapy should be interrupted until resolution or significant improvement of symptoms.
If ICI-related rash does not respond to topical or oral corticosteroids, is grade ≥ 3, or is intolerable, a dermatological consultation is recommended.
Grade ≥ 2 dermatological events (rash, pruritus) may recur after steroid taper. Therefore, a dermatological consultation or use of a steroid-sparing agent is recommended (rituximab for pemphigus (LE: 1) or bullous pemphigoid (LE: 4), dupilumab for eczema (LE: 1), infliximab for lichenoid rash, and omalizumab for urticaria/pruritus (LE: 1)).
Patients who have experienced grade 3 ICI-related rash may be re-challenged with ICIs. Rash that does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy should underscore the possibility of an infection and corresponding cultures should be obtained.

### Hemorrhagic bullae on bilateral lower extremities [^111CjgCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 33-year-old man newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with worsening hemorrhagic bullae on the extremities that started 4 days earlier as a pink macular rash sparing the trunk. The patient denied any past medical history, medications, allergies, illicit drugs, or trauma over the last year.

On physical exam, the dorsal hands had scattered petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles. The palms and soles were unaffected. Nonpitting edema and numerous hemorrhagic bullae with erythematous rims mixed with purpuric papules and plaques in a retiform pattern were noted on the lower extremities.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous erythema multiforme
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

Answers:
A. Bullous erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Bullous erythema multiforme is an immune mediated hypersensitivity reaction that presents with targetoid lesions on the skin and mucosal surfaces.
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster is a dermatomal eruption that occurs when the varicella zoster virus is reactivated in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and commonly occurs in association with immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and/or anticoagulant use.
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a self-limiting rare manifestation of a common vasculitic disease in childhood and is frequently associated with abdominal pain, arthralgias and/or renal involvement.
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis (Fig 1) – Correct. Bullous LCV is a manifestation of small vessel vasculitis, characterized by immune complex deposition in postcapillary venules leading to destructive inflammatory venulitis (Fig 1, Fig 2 3). Syphilis-induced endothelial cell swelling and endarteritis obliterans have been documented, but cases of LCV, especially with concurrent HIV infection, are rare. The potential mechanisms involve delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by antibody-antigen complexes and neutrophil hyperactivation, with HIV-induced immune alterations contributing.
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune blistering condition that arises due to autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen. These bullae typically erupt in sites of trauma and can progress to milia and scarring.

### Utility of skin biopsy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1119fF9t]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can add valuable data to help with accurate diagnosis in some patients with SLE who develop rashes. An important next step for individual clinicians is to determine what specific clinical scenarios would warrant a biopsy; we suggest biopsies for cases in which the clinical appearance of a rash is ambiguous. It is worth performing a biopsy of clinically ambiguous rashes in patients with SLE as a significant percentage may show discordant results between clinical and histopathological diagnosis, which may impact subsequent treatment choices. This data further support the importance of the involvement of dermatologists in the care of patients with SLE with cutaneous abnormalities.

### Erythema nodosum-like rash in a COVID-19 patient: a case report [^115LUCqG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease first described in Wuhan, China, which has quickly emerged as a global pandemic with a myriad of manifestations including dermatologic (Li My et al., n.d.; Gottlieb and Long, 2020 [1,2]). A variety of cutaneous symptoms have presented throughout various stages of the disease (Marzano, 2020; Recalcati, n.d.; Henry et al., n.d.; Fernandez-Nieto et al., n.d.; Quintana-Castanedo et al., n.d. [3–5,7,8]). We describe a case of a female patient who presented with an Erythema Nodosum-like exanthema likely secondary to COVID-19. The patient described tested positive for COVID-19 three days prior to presentation for the rash with minimal other symptoms of COVID-19. Given the high infectivity rate as well as multisystem presentation, it is important to continue to report on novel presentations of the virus for early identification and treatment of complications.

### Relapsing pityriasis rosea with HHV-7 reactivation in an 11-year-old girl [^111Xb9fW]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) usually presents as acute exanthema with oval erythematous-squamous lesions localized on the trunk, arms, and legs with spontaneous remission. We present an unusual case of PR with frequent relapses during a period of 7 years. An 11-year-old white female patient presented with many pruritic erythematous oval lesions on her trunk. A second episode followed 2 years later with several pruritic erythematous lesions on her lower limbs. During the following 5 years, the patient had several relapses per year, with 1 to 3 lesions on changing localizations. PR was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical presentation and detection of human herpesvirus 7 DNA. Spontaneous remission occurred without treatment in each episode. Relapsing PR is a rare form of PR characterized by a lower number of lesions and smaller sized lesions compared with the classic form of PR. Pediatricians should consider the diagnosis of relapsing PR even if only a single or few erythematous lesions are present.

Discussion

The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the USA since 2001. The histology of syphilis, though widely studied, still remains a diagnostic challenge, particularly when the clinical presentation does not suggest the diagnosis. We present an overview of the clinical and pathological features commonly associated with cutaneous primary and secondary syphilis, addressing, at the end, the current case.

Treponema pallidum, as is well known, is the etiological organism of syphilis. Syphilis presents in one of three stages — primary, secondary and tertiary — with primary and secondary syphilis being the most common. Secondary syphilis is most commonly encountered in dermatopathology practice. The anogenital region is the most common location. However, 5% of cases arise in extragenital sites, which are termed endemic, or non-venereal, syphilis. The oral cavity is the most commonly involved extragenital site, but any site can be involved.

In primary syphilis, the lesion typically appears as a chancre, a punched-out, painless ulcer that develops 20–30 days after exposure to T. pallidum and may be associated with painless lymphadenopathy. These lesions resolve within 1–5 weeks and do not scar.

Secondary syphilis arises 6–8 weeks after the primary chancre. The lesions initially present as 5–10 mm erythematous macules on the head, face and neck similar to a viral xanthem. A polymorphic papular eruption subsequently occurs and consists of coppery red papules, measuring 3–10 mm in diameter. Involvement of the palms, soles and oral cavity is highly suspicious for secondary syphilis. However, this classic progression is not always observed and there is clinical significant overlap with other entities and non-specific presentations. Patients can also present with other cutaneous manifestations, some of which overlap with syphilis. These include papulosquamous/psoriasiform lesions, oral ulcers, condylomata, bullous lesions, and erythema muliforme-like folliculitis. Patients with secondary syphilis can also develop fever, headache, weight loss, myalgias and arthralgias. Left untreated, secondary syphilis resolves within 2–10 weeks. After a latent phase, patients can progress to cure with seronegativity; seropositivity without lesions; or develop lesions of tertiary syphilis.

### Dermatologic emergencies… [^113xMK7F]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most common rickettsial disease in the United States. It has an overall mortality rate of 5 to 10 percent. R. rickettsii is transmitted via tick bites and spreads through the lymphatic system, causing a vasculitis that can affect all organs, most commonly the skin and adrenals. Ultimately, R. rickettsii causes increased vascular permeability with consequential decreased osmotic pressure, edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. The diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is primarily clinical. The classic triad of symptoms associated with the disease includes fever, headache, and rash in a person with a history of tick bite or exposure to ticks. 8 Patients also may present with nausea, vomiting, myalgia, anorexia, and severe abdominal pain. The rash appears two to five days after the onset of fever in 80 to 90 percent of patients.

9 Many patients present before the rash appears; therefore, a high index of suspicion is warranted in endemic areas when a patient presents with severe symptoms that mimic a viral illness. The rash begins as small, blanching, nonpruritic macules that develop into a maculopapular rash and progress after several days to petechial lesions. The classic spotted appearance occurs when the petechial lesions coalesce and form ecchymosis. 3 In later stages of the disease, the skin can become tender and desquamate. The early rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever mimics many infectious and noninfectious diseases that have an associated maculopapular rash. 16 The petechial rash that occurs in Rocky Mountain spotted fever also occurs in other conditions 17. 1–12 It begins around the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles, eventually covering the extremities and trunk. The face is usually spared.

A rash on the palms and soles is a distinct distribution that occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 9, 17 However, other exanthems can present with fever and rash on the palms and soles. 16 In patients with severe disease in whom treatment is delayed, complications can include cardiac and renal failure, meningitis, and pneumonitis.

### Amlodipine-induced linear IgA disease [^112gnAv3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of a pruritic rash, which had started a week after commencing treatment with amlodipine. On physical examination, large, well-demarcated erythematous plaques, surrounded by small clusters of clear vesicles, were seen on the patient's torso. Subepidermal blisters with neutrophils and eosinophils were seen in a skin biopsy, and direct immunofluorescence showed deposition of IgA along the basement membrane, in keeping with a diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis (LAD). Amlodipine was discontinued, and the patient was started on prednisolone 30 mg, supplemented shortly afterwards by dapsone, which resulted in prompt resolution of the rash. Only a few cases of drug-induced LAD have been reported, mostly in association with vancomycin. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case precipitated by amlodipine.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117CEA92]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — lesion characteristics and differential include that CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, whereas a painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis. Individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours, but new lesions might be developing simultaneously at other skin sites, while in contrast, vasculitis lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes, although in some cases lesions might be more evanescent, similar to ordinary CU. Angioedema typically appears as nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema, and the medical work-up should keep in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases.

### Annular lesions: diagnosis and treatment [^112AmniE]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Annular lesions can present in a variety of diseases. Knowledge of the physical appearance and history of presentation of these skin findings can help in the diagnosis. A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. Recognizing erythema migrans is important in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease so that antibiotics can be initiated promptly. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, which is due to a hypersensitivity reaction, presents with annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions. Treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness. Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders, and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. Annular lesions occur less commonly in persons with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called on to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, based on identification of a primary lesion, uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. In addition, distribution and grouping of lesions helps support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists consciously or unconsciously use pattern recognition to arrive at their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and their having previously viewed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and presents an approach to diagnosis.

### Case of bullous grover disease [^114DhGUp]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Grover disease is an acquired acantholytic dermatosis affecting middle-aged men, with pruritus being the most commonly associated symptom. Grover disease tends to wax and wane and can last between several months to several years. Although Grover disease is usually papular, we report here a patient who presented with mainly vesicular and bullous lesions on his back originally concerning for folliculitis, contact dermatitis, or disseminated herpes simplex viral infection. Skin biopsy demonstrated acantholysis, suprabasal blisters, and a predominantly lymphocytic dermal infiltrate. Tzanck preparation for giant cells, immunohistochemistry for viral markers, and direct immunofluorescence staining were all negative. A diagnosis of bullous Grover disease was made based on clinicopathological correlation. Minocycline was recommended based on report of its efficacy. However, patient declined treatment and his rash self-resolved within a couple of months. This case brings awareness to this atypical variant of Grover disease and encourages physician to include Grover disease in their differential of vesiculobullous disorders.

Introduction

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, typically self-limited mucocutaneous eruption characterized by distinctive target lesions. In a subset of patients, EM has a more chronic course, with recurrent episodes or even persistent disease. In some of these patients, EM is related to chronic infections, most commonly herpes simplex virus (HSV), and will respond to antiviral therapy. However, in up to 58% of patients, the etiology is unknown, and in these cases treatment is often difficult.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis
B. Erythrasma
C. Tinea corporis and cruris
D. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
E. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)

Answers:
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis – Incorrect. This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by episodic/seasonal circinate, erythematous plaques with scaling, and centrifugal peeling. It predominantly involves palms and soles and may extend up the extremities. It rarely involves the trunk and face. Blisters occasionally occur in the center of new plaques.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. Erythrasma is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum overgrowth in the stratum corneum. Well-defined scaly plaques involve intertriginous sites of the trunk and toes. Coral red fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is classic and was negative in this patient's case.
C. Tinea corporis and cruris – Incorrect. Tinea corporis and cruris are dermatophyte infections of the trunk, extremities, and groin, respectively. Classic lesions have advancing, scaly border and central clearing. Hyphae are seen on histopathology and potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep).
D. EKV – Correct. EKV, an autosomal dominant disorder, presents with transient erythematous patches and stable hyperkeratosis. Individual erythematous lesions persist for minutes to hours, although they may last for days. Simultaneously or over time hyperkeratosis evolves. Sharply demarcated, yellow-brown to pink-brown plaques with figurate borders progressively develop on the limbs, buttocks, and trunk in nearly symmetrical distribution. Histopathology shows orthokeratosis, basket-weave hyperkeratosis, moderate-to-severe acanthosis with prominent granular layer, papillomatosis, and dilated elongated capillaries with minimal perivascular inflammation in the papillary dermis.
E. PSEK – Incorrect. PSEK begins during infancy or early childhood with fixed, sharply demarcated polycyclic hyperkeratotic plaques on erythematous base with fine scale or a rough, verrucous surface. They are symmetrically distributed on extremities, buttocks, face, and occasionally the trunk. Transient erythema and relative sparing of the face differentiate EKV from PSEK.

### A pemphigus-like presentation of secondary syphilis [^1155719z]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 18-year-old African American man with Fitzpatrick skin type V and a past medical history of atopic dermatitis presented to the emergency department with a rash that started approximately 4 days earlier on the buttocks and subsequently spread to the rest of the body. The rash was pruritic and burning, with a clear exudate. He reported blurry vision lasting for approximately 1 month, bilateral knee pain, and malaise. He denied fevers, chills, chest pain, loss of hair, cough, sore throat, headache, or shortness of breath and had no history of herpetic oral lesions, dysuria, penile discharge, or recent international travel. He acknowledged being sexually active with 1 same-sex partner but denied that his partner had any similar lesions. The patient denied taking any medication, including recreational drugs.

On physical examination, there were diffuse eroded erythematous scaly plaques with scalloped borders, as well as several vesicles and bullae on his arms, trunk, penis, buttocks, and legs (Fig 1, A - D). The patient's palms and soles showed scales with subtle dusky purpuric macules (Fig 1, E and F). No intraoral lesions were noted. Diagnostic cultures and serologic tests were performed, including rapid plasma reagin (RPR), fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption, chlamydia DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gonorrhea DNA PCR, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and viral and bacterial cultures. Anti-desmoglein (Dsg)/indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG against serum Dsg1 and Dsg3, and cutaneous immunofluorescence were performed, the results of which were all found to be within normal ranges. A 4-mm punch biopsy of perilesional vesicular skin from the upper medial portion of the right thigh was submitted for treponemal immunohistochemistry staining. Ocular examination ruled out ophthalmic manifestations of neurosyphilis. The patient was treated with 1 dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine. On follow-up examination, he showed improvement of his symptoms, and all lesions appeared to be healed, with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Dermatologic findings in 2 patients with COVID-19 [^114i591E]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly developed into a global pandemic and public health emergency. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily produces fever and respiratory symptoms, although involvement of other organ systems has been reported, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal manifestations. The cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are largely unknown but case reports and case series are accumulating in the literature. Here we describe 2 patients with cutaneous eruptions after SARS-CoV-2 infection and review the known literature on COVID-19–related dermatologic manifestations.

### Cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy and hypersensitivity [^112anRqS]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions may manifest with either organ-specific or systemic symptoms, but cutaneous eruptions are the most common manifestations. Different medications may cause identical skin symptoms, whereas hypersensitivity to a single drug may manifest with various patterns of symptoms depending on the pathomechanism of hypersensitivity. Drug reactions should be also taken into account in the differential diagnosis of numerous skin rashes. Analysis of morphology of drug-induced lesions, about potential immunologic or nonimmunological mechanisms, is important for the final diagnosis. Thus, here the authors present a morphologic approach to the diagnosis of cutaneous drug-induced eruptions.

### How to differentiate skin rash in covid, mononucleosis, chickenpox, sixth disease and measles [^11748s5i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin rashes seen during COVID-19 usually feature maculopapular or vesicular morphology, thus mimicking cutaneous eruptions occurring in other common infectious dermatoses, such as mononucleosis, chickenpox, sixth disease and measles, with possible diagnostic mistakes. In this review article, we sought to provide a practical overview about clinical appearance of skin rashes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Recent Findings

The study summarizes literature evidence on clinical patterns of COVID-19-associated maculopapular or vesicular rash, with a particular emphasis on the principal points of differentiation with possible mimickers.

Summary

Several differences do exist between rashes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral eruptions, mainly including lesions morphology, spreading pattern, symptoms and mucosal involvement. The increase of awareness of such features among clinicians may help promptly recognize COVID-19-related exanthemas in order to take proper action to manage the infection.

### Progressive rash as the first sign ofmeningitis and bacteremia [^116e8P3W]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient had trialed a number of systemic medications, including ustekinumab, etanercept, cyclosporine, and secukinumab, for his pustular psoriasis. While on secukinumab, he had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, which was minimally responsive to oral steroids. His gastroenterology and dermatology providers agreed to start infliximab in combination with methotrexate for durability of response, which ultimately led to the remission of his ulcerative colitis and moderate control of his pustular psoriasis. Prior to his presentation to the emergency department, the patient's psoriasis and ulcerative colitis were relatively well controlled on 700 mg infliximab every 6 weeks (8.64 mg/kg) and 20 mg methotrexate weekly, although he occasionally experienced psoriasis flares the week before infliximab infusions.

The patient attributed his subjective fevers at the time of presentation to a pustular psoriasis flare, as he had previously experienced low-grade fevers and vigorous chills in the setting of psoriasis exacerbation. He initiated 0.1% triamcinolone ointment to the affected areas twice daily and ibuprofen for fever. Over the next 5 days, the rash intensified in color and spread over his torso, and the fever and chills persisted. On day 5, the patient's wife noticed he was difficult to arouse, prompting emergency care. In the emergency department, he was febrile (101.7 °F), his blood pressure was 124/69 mmHg, and he had a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. A physical examination in the emergency room revealed "a reddish, ruddled colored diffuse macular rash with overlying desquamation on the anterior and posterior torso and proximal thighs with papules at the edges of the rash". A complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin were obtained in addition to blood cultures and a lumbar puncture. The laboratory tests were within normal limits except for procalcitonin (elevated to 1.3 ng/mL; reference range ≤ 0.5 ng/mL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (elevated to 41 mm/hr; reference range 0–20 mm/hr). His cerebral spinal fluid was notable for low glucose (17 mg/dL; reference range 40–70 mg/dL), high protein (258 mg/dL; reference range 15–45 mg/dL), and white blood cell count of 662/μL, consistent with L. monocytogenes meningitis. The blood cultures were also positive for L. monocytogenes. The patient's last infliximab infusion had occurred 12 days (< 2 weeks) prior to his hospitalization, and the methotrexate was held while he was in the hospital. The patient was treated with intravenous ampicillin (10 g × 4 weeks) and gentamycin (475 mg × 12 days). On day 2 of his hospitalization, the patient returned to baseline mental status. He disclosed the consumption of deli meats in the week preceding the onset of his rash.

### The rash that leads to eschar formation [^114eJZY4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes. This contribution is intended to help dermatologists identify and manage these various dermatologic conditions, as well as provide an algorithm that can be utilized when approaching a patient presenting with an eschar.

### Reactivated chronic graft-versus-host disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1152zqEv]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

Our patient was a 51-year-old African American male with a history of stage IV Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma treated with matched-related allogeneic SCT 2 years prior. His SCT had been complicated by skin-limited cGVHD previously stable for greater than a year. He presented to our dermatology clinic with a 9-day history of a painful, pruritic rash on his hands and feet that soon spread over his shoulders and back. He had no constitutional complaints and no other organ involvement, and his integumentary system was otherwise negative on review. One week prior to the onset of cutaneous symptoms, the patient had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

A physical examination revealed annular violaceous-to-erythematous papules and plaques with peripheral scale scattered over the torso, and most prominently over the lower back and shoulders (Fig 1). Similar papules were also noted on dorsal hands and in the interdigital space of the first and second fingers bilaterally. On the plantar surfaces of both feet, there were deep-seated pseudovesicles with small rims of scale that were exquisitely tender to palpation (Fig 2). No other associated mucocutaneous findings were identified. Initial differential diagnosis was broad and included lichen planus, scabies, lichenoid GVHD, pityriasis rosacea, syphilis, and granuloma annulare.

Non-specific morphologies

Outside of the 10 core diagnoses discussed above, there exist other potential non-specific presentations that occur at higher frequencies. These non-specific presentations require an evaluation as described above in order to come to a core diagnosis, when possible. When a core diagnosis is not reachable, workup may at least reveal new data that will allow for more targeted therapy in addition to severity grading (online supplemental table S23). The non-specific morphologies include hyperkeratotic papules and plaques, isolated mucositis, or the previously often diagnosed 'maculopapular rash'. Importantly, we would encourage clinicians to avoid making a final diagnosis of these non-specific subtypes, but rather to use them as descriptive terms while undertaking the evaluation of patient with D-irAE.
