Cardiac cath pre op

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about preoperative cardiac catheterization before noncardiac surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of preoperative cardiac evaluation. Then, I should verify the ACC/AHA and ESC stepwise algorithms and where catheterization fits. Next, I will examine the evidence base for routine preoperative coronary angiography and revascularization. After that, I need to check special scenarios where catheterization is appropriate. I will then review procedural risks and timing considerations, consider alternatives like CCTA and stress testing, and finally synthesize a practical decision framework with cost–value and implementation considerations [^113wMyxL].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: preoperative cardiac evaluation aims to identify and mitigate perioperative risk, not to perform a blanket cardiac workup, and decisions should be driven by whether testing will change management and timing of surgery, not by habit or fear of litigation [^113wMyxL] [^111tfVgV].

> I will now examine the ACC/AHA stepwise algorithm to anchor decisions: screen for active cardiac conditions; if present, evaluate and treat per guideline-directed care, which may include catheterization and delaying surgery; if none, assess surgery risk; if low-risk surgery, proceed; if not low-risk, assess functional capacity; if ≥ 4 METs without symptoms, proceed; if < 4 METs or unknown, count clinical risk factors and consider noninvasive testing only if results will change management; invasive coronary angiography is not routine and is reserved for specific indications such as unstable coronary syndromes or when revascularization is indicated independent of the noncardiac surgery [^112QCuRM].

> Wait, let me verify the ESC perspective to ensure alignment: ESC 2022 explicitly recommends against routine preoperative invasive coronary angiography in patients with stable chronic coronary syndrome undergoing low- or intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery, and advises using the same indications for invasive angiography as in the non-surgical setting, reinforcing a conservative approach to catheterization preoperatively [^1143Gmd5] [^116Lxb7c] [^1122yYfE].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for routine preoperative catheterization and revascularization; the CARP randomized trial showed no reduction in perioperative MI or mortality with preoperative revascularization in stable CAD, and contemporary registry data show persistent practice variation with many preoperative PCIs performed despite uncertain benefit, highlighting potential harm from delays and antiplatelet management issues [^114iNmYg] [^111oQSWS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check special scenarios where catheterization is appropriate: unstable coronary syndromes or decompensated heart failure warrant guideline-directed evaluation that may include angiography and delay of elective surgery; in vascular surgery, particularly carotid endarterectomy, some guidelines suggest considering preoperative invasive angiography in selected stable patients, though this remains nuanced and should be individualized; in adult congenital heart disease, consultation with ACHD specialists and selective catheterization for hemodynamics or interventions is advised; in pulmonary hypertension or unclear right heart failure phenotypes, preoperative right heart catheterization can guide optimization and perioperative planning [^112QCuRM] [^114AFHr6] [^1118Hke9] [^114co41s] [^114vAaDx].

> I should double-check procedural risks and timing because they directly affect surgical planning: diagnostic catheterization carries bleeding, vascular complications, contrast nephropathy, and radiation exposure; hemoglobin commonly declines over the subsequent week, which can complicate near-term surgery; femoral access increases bleeding risk compared with radial; antiplatelet therapy after PCI can force surgical delays and create bleeding–thrombosis dilemmas, so timing and stent choice matter greatly [^116ZZQpv] [^112A7JF1] [^116LRWEi].

> Let me consider alternatives and their limitations; CCTA can refine risk estimation but frequently overcalls disease in low-risk patients, leading to delays and resource use; preoperative stress testing has low yield in stable patients with good functional capacity and does not improve outcomes in that subgroup; ESC advises against routine pre-op ECG or echo in low-risk patients, reinforcing a selective strategy [^116ZUsDf] [^114iNmYg] [^114Wf9xZ] [^111np9bn].

> I need to ensure the decision framework is explicit: start with history, exam, and ECG when indicated; assess functional capacity; classify surgery risk; if low-risk surgery, proceed; if non-low-risk and poor or unknown functional capacity, apply clinical risk tools such as RCRI; only pursue noninvasive testing if results will change perioperative management; reserve invasive angiography for unstable presentations, revascularization candidates independent of the noncardiac surgery, or specific high-risk vascular scenarios after multidisciplinary discussion [^112QCuRM] [^1122yYfE].

> But wait, what about cost–value and implementation; overuse of preoperative testing increases costs and length of stay without proven outcome benefit, and simulated analyses suggest deferring testing in low-risk patients improves value; aligning institutional protocols with guideline-concordant care reduces unnecessary catheterizations and costs without harming outcomes, supporting a conservative, indication-driven approach [^114iTxfU] [^111H75Qk] [^113Qe4xC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine preoperative catheterization might be justified in all vascular surgery patients; hold on, I should verify and correct that overreach — contemporary guidelines emphasize selective use, with invasive angiography considered only when results will change management or when specific vascular procedures like carotid endarterectomy raise particular concerns, and otherwise favor medical optimization and selective noninvasive testing rather than routine catheterization [^114AFHr6] [^112QCuRM] [^1122yYfE].

> Final synthesis: routine preoperative cardiac catheterization is not recommended for stable patients undergoing noncardiac surgery; it should be reserved for unstable coronary syndromes, decompensated heart failure, or when revascularization is indicated independent of the planned operation, with selective consideration in specific high-risk vascular contexts and complex congenital disease after multidisciplinary review, while prioritizing medical optimization, functional assessment, and guideline-concordant selective testing to avoid delays and harm [^113gSXom] [^1143Gmd5] [^114iNmYg].

---

Preoperative cardiac catheterization is **not routine** for noncardiac surgery [^113gSXom]; it is reserved for patients with **active cardiac conditions** or **high-risk features** in whom results will change management [^112QCuRM]. Routine catheterization in stable patients does not improve outcomes and may delay surgery or cause complications [^114iNmYg]. Use a stepwise approach: assess for active cardiac disease, functional capacity, and surgical risk; reserve catheterization for unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, or high-risk scenarios where revascularization is indicated independent of the planned surgery [^112QCuRM] [^1122yYfE].

---

## Indications for preoperative cardiac catheterization

Preoperative cardiac catheterization is **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Active cardiac conditions**: Unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, or recent myocardial infarction (MI) require evaluation and stabilization before noncardiac surgery [^112QCuRM].

- **High-risk surgical procedures**: Patients undergoing high-risk surgeries (e.g. major vascular surgery, open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair) with poor functional capacity or multiple cardiac risk factors may benefit from preoperative catheterization if results will alter management [^115XoMhS].

- **Equivocal noninvasive testing**: Positive or indeterminate results from noninvasive stress tests may necessitate invasive coronary angiography to define coronary anatomy and guide potential revascularization [^1163ubR7].

- **Known coronary artery disease (CAD) with high-risk features**: Patients with known CAD presenting with unstable symptoms or high-risk clinical features may require catheterization to assess the extent of coronary involvement and plan intervention [^112QCuRM].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

Preoperative cardiac catheterization is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Stable patients with good functional capacity**: Patients with adequate functional capacity (≥ 4 METs) without symptoms of cardiac distress do not benefit from routine preoperative catheterization [^113gSXom].

- **Low-risk surgical procedures**: Routine catheterization is not indicated for low-risk surgeries (e.g. cataract surgery, minor dermatological procedures) due to minimal perioperative cardiac risk [^1143Gmd5].

- **Patients with contraindications to invasive procedures**: Severe coagulopathy, active infection, or severe contrast allergy may preclude catheterization.

---

## Risks and complications

Preoperative cardiac catheterization carries potential risks and complications, including:

- **Bleeding and hematoma**: Access-site bleeding, hematoma formation, or pseudoaneurysm may occur, particularly with femoral access [^112A7JF1].

- **Contrast-induced nephropathy**: Risk of renal impairment, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Allergic reactions**: Contrast dye allergies or hypersensitivity reactions.

- **Vascular injury**: Arterial dissection, thrombosis, or embolization.

- **Radiation exposure**: Prolonged fluoroscopy exposure, particularly relevant in younger patients or repeated procedures.

---

## Alternative noninvasive diagnostic tests

Several **noninvasive tests** can assess cardiac risk without the risks of invasive catheterization:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) | Patients with adequate functional capacity | Noninvasive, functional assessment | May miss significant CAD, false negatives |
| Stress echocardiography | Patients with intermediate risk, poor functional capacity | Assesses ischemia, valve function, ventricular function | Operator-dependent, false positives |
| Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) | Intermediate-risk patients, poor functional capacity | Detects ischemia, risk stratification | Radiation exposure, false positives [^notfound] |
| Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) | Low-to-intermediate risk patients | Noninvasive, anatomical assessment | Radiation exposure, contrast risks, overestimation of risk [^116ZUsDf] |

---

## Impact on surgical timing and outcomes

Preoperative cardiac catheterization can significantly impact **surgical timing and outcomes**:

- **Delay in surgery**: Catheterization may delay necessary surgery, potentially increasing perioperative risk, particularly in urgent or semi-urgent procedures [^111oQSWS].

- **Revascularization considerations**: If significant CAD is identified, revascularization (PCI or CABG) may be recommended, further delaying surgery and complicating perioperative management due to antiplatelet therapy requirements [^116LRWEi].

- **Outcome benefits**: In selected high-risk patients, preoperative catheterization and subsequent revascularization may reduce perioperative cardiac complications, although evidence is mixed and largely dependent on patient selection and surgical context [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) provide clear recommendations on preoperative cardiac catheterization:

- **Routine catheterization is not recommended**: For stable patients undergoing low- or intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery [^113gSXom] [^116Lxb7c].

- **Selective use**: Catheterization is reserved for patients with active cardiac conditions, high-risk surgical procedures, or equivocal noninvasive testing results [^112QCuRM].

- **Emphasis on functional capacity**: Patients with adequate functional capacity (≥ 4 METs) without symptoms do not benefit from routine preoperative catheterization [^112QCuRM] [^113gSXom].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk of complications from invasive procedures, necessitating careful risk-benefit analysis [^111nTrRK].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Higher risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, requiring renal protective strategies or alternative noninvasive tests [^notfound].

- **Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**: May require individualized assessment based on clinical presentation and surgical risk [^notfound].

---

Preoperative cardiac catheterization is **not routine** for noncardiac surgery and should be reserved for patients with active cardiac conditions, high-risk surgical procedures, or equivocal noninvasive testing results. Routine catheterization in stable patients does not improve outcomes and may delay surgery or cause complications. Current guidelines emphasize a stepwise approach, prioritizing functional capacity and clinical risk factors to guide the need for invasive testing.

### The preoperative cardiovascular evaluation of the intermediate-risk patient: new data, changing strategies [^115SD4Eo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The intermediate-risk preoperative patient can be defined as a patient without severely symptomatic or unstable heart disease who, nonetheless, has clinical predictors of adverse perioperative cardiovascular events. Newer data have created an awareness of competing considerations in managing these patients. There is still debate about how to appropriately select patients for noninvasive cardiac testing, invasive coronary testing, coronary revascularization, beta-blockers, or a combination of these. In this article, we review the evidence pertaining to these issues. We conclude that intermediate-risk preoperative patients are best managed by an approach that emphasizes the following points: intermediate-risk patients should be identified and risk stratified using a clinical tool (eg, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index); noninvasive cardiac testing should be reserved for those patients with multiple clinical predictors of risk or the presence of other modifying factors; preoperative coronary revascularization does not appear to reduce perioperative risk in patients with significant but stable coronary artery disease; and medical therapy should be optimized for these patients, including the application of beta-blockers in all intermediate-risk patients that do not have contraindications.

### Preoperative cardiac risk assessment [^115XoMhS]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. An important subset of heart disease is perioperative myocardial infarction, which affects approximately 50,000 persons each year. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have coauthored a guideline on preoperative cardiac risk assessment, as has the American College of Physicians (ACP). The ACC/AHA guideline uses major, intermediate, and minor clinical predictors to stratify patients into different cardiac risk categories. Patients with poor functional status or those undergoing high-risk surgery require further risk stratification via cardiac stress testing. The ACP guideline also starts by screening patients for clinical variables that predict perioperative cardiac complications. However, the ACP did not feel there was enough evidence to support poor functional status as a significant predictor of increased risk. High-risk patients would sometimes merit preoperative cardiac catheterization by the ACC/AHA guideline, while the ACP version would reserve catheterization only for those who were candidates for cardiac revascularization independent of their noncardiac surgery. A recent development in prophylaxis of surgery-related cardiac complications is the use of beta blockers perioperatively for patients with cardiac risk factors.

### Preoperative cardiac evaluation [^113BrPhG]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The current standards for preoperative cardiac evaluation and the guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association call for noninvasive or invasive cardiac evaluation in certain patients. Perioperative use of beta-adrenergic blockade has been shown to reduce cardiac complication rates, diminishing the positive predictive value and the likelihood ratio of a positive result of a preoperative cardiac test, unfavorably shifting the risk to benefit ratio of preoperative tests and any possible therapeutic action that one might take based on the test. A new paradigm might be emerging that makes cardiac tests unnecessary except in the highest-risk patients identified by clinical variables.

### Cardiac risk stratification and protection [^113NrE4g]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The goal of preoperative cardiac evaluation is to screen for undiagnosed cardiac disease or to find evidence of known conditions that are poorly controlled to allow management that reduces the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. A careful history and physical examination combined with the procedure-specific risk is the cornerstone of this assessment. This article reviews a brief history of prior cardiac risk stratification indexes, explores current practice guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Task Force, reviews current methods for preoperative evaluation, discusses revascularization options, and evaluates perioperative medication recommendations.

### What is the clinical utility of routine cardiac catheterization before a fontan operation? [^113fCa6V]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with single-ventricle circulation presenting for Fontan completion routinely undergo cardiac catheterization despite ongoing debate concerning its additive value. Increasing interest in noninvasive preoperative evaluation alone led the authors to analyze the utility of routine pre-Fontan catheterization and to determine whether a subset of patients could avoid this invasive procedure. Patients younger than 5 years referred for pre-Fontan evaluation were retrospectively reviewed. Medical records and catheter angiograms were examined, and catheterizations were categorized as "additive" based on predetermined criteria. Associations between precatheterization variables, catheterization findings, and short-term postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Cardiac catheterization was clinically nonadditive for 89 of 175 patients undergoing pre-Fontan evaluation (51%). There were no robust precatheterization predictors of a nonadditive catheterization. Echocardiography did not fully demonstrate the relevant anatomy of 115 patients (66%), most frequently due to inadequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries, and 22 patients had additive catheterizations due to new diagnostic findings alone. Interventions at catheterization were frequent and deemed "important" for 64 patients (37%). Catheterization hemodynamic data were not associated with early postoperative outcomes. Minor catheterization complications occurred for 51 patients (29%) and major complications for 4 patients (2%). Although at least 50% of the patients presenting for Fontan completion may be able to avoid routine catheterization safely, an echocardiography-based imaging strategy alone is insufficient to allow proper identification of those who could be evaluated noninvasively. A more comprehensive imaging strategy not based solely on echocardiography should be considered.

Although cardiovascular anesthesiologists play a role in the multidisciplinary heart team, they are generally not involved prior to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. This work was designed to broadly cover the factors influencing decision-making when proceeding with coronary angiography in a patient with suspected coronary artery disease. The authors cover the principles, rationale, benefits, and downsides of common tests involved.

### Guideline chaos: conflicting recommendations for preoperative cardiac assessment [^114kTyxq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) have disseminated guidelines to assess preoperative cardiac risks before noncardiac surgery. The objectives of this study were to determine if these guidelines differ in preoperative recommendations for a group of patients, and whether these recommendations differ from actual provider recommendations. In this retrospective cohort study, patient characteristics and physician recommendations were abstracted from electronic medical records of consecutive patients attending a Veteran Affairs medical preoperative evaluation clinic from January 1 to April 1, 1998. Patient characteristics were used to determine what preoperative cardiac testing should have been ordered if each guideline was followed. Possible recommendations included operation without testing (OWT), noninvasive stress testing (NST), cardiac catheterization (CC), or cancel or delay surgery (OTHER). Recommendations were compared using statistical tests for agreement. Of the 138 patients identified, most underwent moderate-risk surgeries. Recommendations for preoperative testing were discordant between guidelines for 17% of patients (kappa = 0.38). Guidelines never agreed on the need for NST. Extreme differences in recommendations (i.e., one recommends OWT, the other CC) occurred in 9 patients (7%). Physicians ordered NST more often (n = 27) than either guideline. In this subgroup of patients where providers ordered a NST, the 2 guidelines significantly differed (kappa = 0.26). When applied to real patients being evaluated for surgery, ACC/AHA and ACP guidelines significantly differed in recommendations for preoperative cardiac testing. Results have implications for implementation, management, and practitioner adherence to published guidelines.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the management of pediatric heart failure (update from 2014) [^112QtTQL]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Anesthetic considerations — perioperative planning and risks in children with heart failure (HF): Children with HF frequently present for diagnostic, surgical, or catheter-based interventions requiring anesthesia care, and children with heart disease undergoing noncardiac procedures have an increased risk of cardiac arrest, significant complications, and mortality. Hypotension requiring inotropic support under anesthesia is a common complication. Comprehensive perioperative planning with multidisciplinary input is essential in managing patients with HF and preventing significant morbidity and mortality, and preoperative evaluation should include risk assessment, medical and surgical history, optimization of cardiac functional status, medication and fasting management, review of pertinent cardiac imaging studies and laboratory results, as well as identification of specific surgical/procedural concerns, location and timing, and team composition. Intraoperative anesthetic management should be individualized based on the preoperative assessment to maintain hemodynamic stability, end-organ perfusion, and prevent cardiovascular collapse, and preoperative discussions should include the appropriateness and availability for MCS, including timing (backup vs elective vs emergent), cannulation and device strategies, location logistics, and procedure being performed; postoperative care extends these considerations including the location and availability of expertise.

### Cardiac surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: perioperative considerations and triage recommendations [^111ZSPEu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative Testing Recommendations for COVID‐19

To safely perform procedures or surgeries during the current pandemic, clinicians must be aware of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID‐19 and testing limitations and benefits to protect other patients and HCWs. In communities with established transmission, there will be a growing population of patients with COVID‐19 who will be minimally symptomatic, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic (estimated to be up to 60%). 9, 10 There will be also a growing population of patients who present to surgery with recent symptoms of COVID‐19 but who are unaware of their disease because of its variable presentation or because they never tested for it. For those with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, shedding may occur through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract for up to 2 to 4 weeks. 11 As we learn more about SARS‐CoV‐2, questions about perioperative testing for surgical patients (and all patients) will continually emerge.

Although there are no data about the clinical benefit of preoperative screening for SARS‐CoV‐2, we recommend preoperative screening in asymptomatic patients be considered in specific situations (Figure 1). Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are a unique population in this COVID‐19 epidemic because of the risk of exposure to others from a highly invasive, aerosol‐generating procedure (AGP), the potentially prolonged hospitalization or ICU stay, and the overall intense healthcare resource use. In addition, knowing a patient's preoperative COVID‐19 status may help with postoperative management and counseling as recent evidence suggests that asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients who undergo surgery may be more susceptible to pneumonia and ARDS postoperatively. 12

### ACC / AHA guidelines for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery: a critical point of view [^113jZqRe]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

This review examines the issue of preoperative cardiac evaluation from a critical point of view, based on recent medical literature. We reviewed the history of that field and focused on the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, which are a cornerstone in the field of cardiac patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. These guidelines synthesized the data into a comprehensive format and established the concept of integrating the patient's risk with the surgical risk. Nevertheless, there are some weaknesses in the guidelines. We believe that a better understanding of the guideline limitations will allow an improved and more educated practice of its recommendations.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive evaluation and management of coronary artery disease (CAD) in cancer patients — preprocedural assessment and revascularization strategy are outlined. Effective clinical risk stratification of patients undergoing cancer surgery must be undertaken prior to the consideration of cardiac catheterization. It should be guided by a collaborative clinical evaluation by oncologists and cardiologists. It is reasonable to consider a staged approach, with an initial coronary anatomy and physiology assessment, followed by an interdisciplinary meeting to outline the optimal plan. Patients with stable angina can be treated medically, as PCI does not offer a survival advantage in most cases. PCI is preferred when the malignancy is aggressive or widespread. CABG can be considered when the malignancy is potentially curable or when the estimated prognosis is acceptable.

### Preoperative cardiac evaluation [^116M9dCC]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery have been published. The integration of clinical risk factors, surgery-specific risk, and functional capacity should be used to determine the need for further diagnostic evaluation. The use of beta-adrenergic blockade in high-risk patients, particularly those with documented myocardium at risk undergoing vascular surgery, has been shown to reduce perioperative risk and may obviate the need for more invasive procedures. Coronary intervention should be reserved for those patients who warrant intervention independent of the noncardiac surgery.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^114vAaDx]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

ISHLT perioperative pulmonary hypertension — preoperative optimization and invasive assessment emphasizes optimizing right ventricular (RV) loading conditions with diuretic adjustment to improve or normalize ventricular filling pressures, maximizing evidence-based medical therapy for PH/PAH and heart failure, and identifying conditions that may cause acute deterioration. Examples include initiation or augmentation of PAH-specific therapies for WHO Group I PAH; oxygen, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; BIPAP for obstructive sleep apnea; and systemic vasodilators and other appropriate heart failure therapies for WHO Group 2 PH. Pulmonary balloon angioplasty has been successfully performed preoperatively for CTEPH prior to non-cardiac surgery to reduce perioperative risk. In moderate to high-risk cases, consideration should be given to preoperative invasive hemodynamic assessment to guide optimization and decision making regarding intraoperative monitoring and postoperative location, which can be done several weeks in advance so therapies can be initiated or escalated. In idiopathic or associated PAH, preoperative right heart catheterization followed by initiation of intravenous prostanoid therapy may be used if poor prognostic findings are demonstrated; patients with severe post-capillary PH may be optimized with diuretics, systemic vasodilators, and perhaps inodilators, and in some cases a right heart catheterization may be done within days of surgery with anticipation of retaining the pulmonary artery catheter depending on hemodynamics and the perioperative monitoring plan.

### Anesthetic considerations for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement [^111nWZQj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

The introduction of transcatheter therapy for valvular heart disease has revolutionized the care of patients with valvular disorders. Pathologic regurgitation or stenosis of the pulmonary valve, right ventricular outflow tract, or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit represent emerging indications for transcatheter therapy. To date, minimal literature exists detailing the anesthetic management of patients undergoing transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement. In this review, the pathophysiology and indications for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement and possible complications unique to this procedure are reviewed. Anesthetic management, including preoperative assessment, intraoperative considerations, and early postoperative monitoring, are discussed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Perioperative cardiac assessment for noncardiac surgery (Figure A) — for patients ≥ 50 years of age — uses a stepwise algorithm: "Need for emergency noncardiac surgery? Yes (Class I, LOE C) Operating room" with "Perioperative surveillance and postoperative risk stratification and risk factor management". If not emergent, assess "Active cardiac conditions"; if present, "Evaluate and treat per ACC/AHA guidelines". If no active conditions and "Low risk surgery", proceed: "Yes (Class I, LOE B) Proceed with planned surgery". If surgery is not low risk, assess function; when "Functional capacity greater than or equal to 4 METs without symptoms", proceed: "Yes (Class IIa, LOE B) Proceed with planned surgery". If functional capacity is "No or unknown", stratify by clinical risk factors: for "3 or more clinical risk factors" with "Vascular surgery", the pathway states "Class IIa, LOE B Consider testing if it will change management‡"; for "1–2 clinical risk factors" and "Intermediate risk surgery", it states "Proceed with planned surgery with HR control§ (Class IIa, LOE B) or consider noninvasive testing (Class IIb LOE B) if it will change management‡"; and for "No clinical risk factors", it shows "Class I, LOE B Proceed with planned surgery". The text notes that after confirming non-urgency the clinician should determine "the patient's active cardiac conditions… and/or perioperative risk predictors", and that if "any active cardiac conditions and/or major risk predictors are present", Figure A "suggests consideration of guideline-based care that may include coronary angiography and postponing or canceling noncardiac surgery", with subsequent use of "the surgical risk and the patient's functional status… to establish the need for noninvasive testing".

### Perioperative considerations for patients undergoing percutaneous ablative therapy for atrial fibrillation [^112jDciu]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in adults and is associated with significant morbidity. Consequently, catheter-based ablative therapy has become increasingly popular, especially with recent innovations such as pulsed field ablation. The preoperative evaluation, including a careful review of comorbidities, anticoagulation management, and antiarrhythmic medication, is of vital importance. Furthermore, understanding the intraoperative considerations and potential complications is imperative to optimizing patient outcomes. This review focuses on the transcatheter endovascular ablation and perioperative anesthetic considerations of patients undergoing these procedures.

European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, more specifically with respect to preoperative imaging, AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain TTE as initial imaging modality for pre-bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt assessment.
Consider obtaining cardiac MRI or CT instead of angiography before bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt.
Perform cardiac catheterization if there are indications for pulmonary vascular resistance measurement or intervention.

### Preoperative planning for structural heart disease [^112AQSGG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative assessment with computed tomography (CT) is critical before transcatheter interventions for structural heart disease. CT provides information for device selection, device sizing, and vascular access approach. The interpreting radiologist must have knowledge of appropriate CT protocols, how and where to obtain the important measurements, and know additional imaging characteristics that are important to describe for optimal support of the interventionalist. CT is the modality of choice for pre-operative evaluation in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement and left atrial appendage occlusion, and is also useful before transcatheter mitral valve replacement, which is an ongoing area of research.

### Practice advisory for preanesthesia evaluation: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on preanesthesia evaluation [^1169xoLv]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists practice advisory — preanesthesia cardiac evaluation other than ECG: Preanesthesia cardiac evaluation may include consultation with specialists and ordering, requiring, or performing tests that range from noninvasive passive or provocative screening tests (e.g., stress testing) to noninvasive and invasive assessment of cardiac structure, function, and vascularity (e.g., echocardiogram, radionucleotide imaging, cardiac catheterization). Anesthesiologists should balance the risks and costs of these evaluations against their benefits, and clinical characteristics to consider include cardiovascular risk factors and type of surgery.

### Implementing ACC / AHA guidelines for the preoperative management of patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for noncardiac surgery: effect on perioperative outcome [^1163ubR7]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To review the new consensus guidelines for cardiac testing for the patient with cardiac disease scheduled for elective, noncardiac surgery, and their impact on cardiac functional testing.

Design

Retrospective chart review study.

Setting

Tertiary care medical center.

Patients

181 patients scheduled for elective, major surgery who met American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) criteria for a preoperative stress test.

Interventions

A variety of tests were ordered, including treadmill stress testing, persantine-thallium imaging, dobutamine echocardiography, and exercise stress echocardiography.

Measurements

The numbers of and outcome of the stress tests and the cardiac outcome of the patients who underwent cardiac testing and surgery were recorded.

Main Results

Abnormal tests occurred in 27 patients. Two patients declined treatment, eight patients had primary medical management, and the remainder (17) had cardiac catheterization. Results included no lesion (2 patients), angioplasty (4 patients), angioplasty plus stenting (1 patient), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (4 patients), and delineated lesions treated with medical optimization (6 patients). One patient had CABG and declined further surgery. One patient had myocardial infarction 6 months after surgery that was treated by medical management after cardiac catheterization. The other 23 patients had surgery without cardiac complication within 1 year of surgery. Only 15% (27/180) of the patients with indications for a stress test had a positive result. Even fewer patients had any alteration of the perioperative period. Despite this finding, cardiac morbidity was very low.

Conclusions

The guidelines for stress test may be over-sensitive, and further prospective clinical studies are indicated.

### Preoperative stress testing: new guidelines [^115LUtKW]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

To date, there are no well controlled trials in the literature that demonstrate an outcome benefit using stress testing as a screening procedure before noncardiac surgery. Perioperative beta-blockade significantly decreases morbidity and mortality, and thus reduces any potential benefit stress testing may have in identifying patients who may advance to more invasive treatment. Preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention has unproven perioperative benefit, and coronary artery bypass graft carries risks that often offset the risk of noncardiac surgery. Unless an outcome benefit from cardiac testing and procedures can be demonstrated in a properly designed trial, their use should generally be restricted to situations in which symptoms or other cardiac findings warrant cardiac evaluation and treatment, regardless of upcoming surgery.

Cardiotoxic therapy candidates with cardiovascular risk — referral and adjunct medical therapy: For patients at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk (based on cardiovascular risk scores) who are potentially undergoing cardiotoxic therapy, referral to a cardiologist and/or cardio-oncology program is advised prior to the initiation of treatment, and for patients with established CAD and without contraindications, adding or continuing ACE-I and beta-blockers (preferably carvedilol or nebivolol) might provide additional cardioprotection. To identify high-risk patients, intensive and frequent screening for CAD or elevated risk via echocardiographic studies and cardiac biomarkers is encouraged.

### Alternatives to the in-person anaesthetist-led preoperative assessment in adults undergoing low-risk or intermediate-risk surgery: a scoping review [^113EnbGb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The current scoping review assesses the literature of a personal preoperative evaluation by an anaesthetist compared with alternative forms of preoperative screening. The methodology of this review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for scoping reviews.

Search strategy

We developed an extensive literature search to identify publications regarding preoperative evaluation in the following online libraries: Embase, Medline, Web-of-Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. No date restriction was used. After initial execution, our search was updated on the 22 October 2021. We identified any additional studies through hand-searches and reviewing the reference lists of the included articles. The full extensive search strategy can be found in the appendix (Appendix I).

Eligibility criteria

For our primary inclusion, we used the Population, Concept, Context framework recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews (Table 1). We did not include studies that solely focused on the additive value of preoperative testing (e.g. ECG's, laboratory-testing or chest radiographs) as this was outside the scope of this review. Nevertheless, multiple large studies with high methodological quality – have already concluded that a standardised 'one-size-fits-all' elaborate preoperative testing approach is inferior to personalised medicine.

Table 1
Population, Concept, Context layout – selection criteria for the inclusion of studies

We excluded studies if their perioperative care was not comparable with standard clinical practice in modern medicine (i.e. studies in which large numbers of patients in remote areas were evaluated by a team of physicians once a year).

Studies were also excluded if full text was not available in English or Dutch or if their publication types were one of the following: case-reports, literature reviews, guidelines, meeting abstracts, abstract-only publications, comments, editorials, letters, textbooks or news.

Studies containing only patients undergoing high-risk procedures were also excluded, since the anaesthetist plays an undisputed key role in the preoperative optimisation of patients undergoing high-risk surgery, as stated in the 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery.

### Preoperative evaluation of the adult patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery: guidelines from the European society of anaesthesiology [^111RRooZ]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of these guidelines on the preoperative evaluation of the adult non-cardiac surgery patient is to present recommendations based on available relevant clinical evidence. The ultimate aims of preoperative evaluation are two-fold. First, we aim to identify those patients for whom the perioperative period may constitute an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, aside from the risks associated with the underlying disease. Second, this should help us to design perioperative strategies that aim to reduce additional perioperative risks. Very few well performed randomised studies on the topic are available and many recommendations rely heavily on expert opinion and are adapted specifically to the healthcare systems in individual countries. This report aims to provide an overview of current knowledge on the subject with an assessment of the quality of the evidence in order to allow anaesthetists all over Europe to integrate - wherever possible - this knowledge into daily patient care. The Guidelines Committee of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) formed a task force with members of subcommittees of scientific subcommittees and individual members of the ESA. Electronic databases were searched from the year 2000 until July 2010 without language restrictions. These searches produced 15425 abstracts. Relevant systematic reviews with meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional surveys were selected. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network grading system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final draft guideline was posted on the ESA website for 4 weeks and the link was sent to all ESA members, individual or national (thus including most European national anaesthesia societies). Comments were collated and the guidelines amended as appropriate. When the final draft was complete, the Guidelines Committee and ESA Board ratified the guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery — scope and intended use — focuses on "the perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management of the adult patient (≥ 18 years of age) being considered for noncardiac surgery (NCS)" and "addresses the time spanning from preoperative evaluation through postoperative care and emphasizes risk assessment, evaluation of functional status, appropriate use of cardiovascular testing and screening, and management of cardiovascular conditions and risks". It also states that "evidence-based management strategies, including pharmacological therapies, perioperative monitoring, and devices, for CVD and associated medical conditions" are addressed, and that it "is intended to inform all clinicians involved in the care of patients being considered for NCS". Preoperative evaluation "encompasses the assessment of perioperative risk and determination of the need for additional cardiovascular testing through exercise, imaging, or biomarker assessment", with the "primary goal of the evaluation" being "evaluation and reduction of a patient's immediate surgical risk", while "follow-up is warranted throughout and beyond the surgical period, when modifiable cardiovascular risk is identified". The "preoperative cardiovascular evaluation begins with a focused history and physical examination and a careful review of a patient's medical history", and "this assessment informs perioperative care and can be used to implement changes in management and therapy".

### Decline in serum hemoglobin in the 7 days after cardiac catheterization [^116ZZQpv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bleeding is an established complication following cardiac catheterization and lower preoperative hemoglobin concentration is a potentially modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. However, typical changes in serum hemoglobin concentration after cardiac catheterization are poorly defined. The authors sought to identify the pattern of change in serum hemoglobin concentration within 7 days after cardiovascular catheterization, factors associated with this change and any association with adverse outcomes.

Design

Retrospective observational study over a 1-year period.

Setting

U.S. academic medical institution.

Participants

Participants were 284 adult patients with baseline hemoglobin concentration ≥ 12 g/dL undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery after cardiovascular catheterization via the femoral arterial route.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Lowest daily hemoglobin concentration was recorded where available for up to 7 days after catheterization and before surgery. Generalized estimating equations identified the pattern of change in serum hemoglobin while regression models identified factors associated with hemoglobin decline. Following cardiovascular catheterization average serum hemoglobin declined over time, reaching a nadir 1.4 g/dL (95% CI 1.0–1.8) below baseline 6 days after catheterization. A higher baseline hemoglobin concentration and lower body mass index were associated with greater maximal decline in hemoglobin concentration after catheterization. Acute preoperative hemoglobin decline was not associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) or a composite adverse outcome that may reflect organ ischemia.

Conclusions

In a cohort of patients before cardiac surgery serum hemoglobin declines during the week after cardiac catheterization, with maximal average decline observed 5 to 7 days after catheterization.

### A geriatric approach to percutaneous coronary interventions in older adults, part II: AExpert panel [^113VUTC7]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Sedation before and during cardiac catheterization

As an increasing proportion of patients undergoing procedures in the catheterization laboratory are of a higher chronological age and greater procedural complexity, there are important considerations for procedural sedation. In 2017, the Society for Coronary Angiography and Interventions published a document outlining pertinent considerations for moderate sedation in patients undergoing coronary angiography. In older adults in particular, it is critical to assess preprocedural comorbidities, such as cardiac function and underlying lung disease, as well as renal and liver function, as these comorbidities may impact the ability of the patient to metabolize sedative agents. In older patients and patients with significant obstructive lung disease or hypotension, consideration should be given to administering "half doses" and titrating sedation to achieve a safe balance between patient comfort and hemodynamic compromise. Additionally, several agents used for sedation or preprocedural treatment have a prolonged half-life in older patients due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics, which along with changes in pharmacodynamics, can lead to unpredictable properties. These agents include diphenhydramine, which has a normal half-life of 7 to 18 hours but can be prolonged in older patients, and benzodiazepines which can have a prolonged half-life and cause paradoxical agitation in older patients. For older patients with a history of poor tolerance of moderate sedation, consideration should be given to engage an anesthesia clinician, if possible, to administer sedation.

Periprocedural antithrombotic management around PCI, chemotherapy, and surgery in cancer: All patients undergoing PCI should receive anticoagulant agents to maintain an activated clotting time of greater than 250 sec during the procedure, and in oncologic patients with severe thrombocytopenia (TP) (< 50k platelets), heparin-induced TP should receive intravenous bivalirudin. If PCI is necessary in patients awaiting cancer surgery, balloon angioplasty without stenting or implantation of BMS is recommended, although newer generation DES may also be acceptable. With chemotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may need to be extended due to the delayed re-endothelialization of the stent. When urgent surgery is needed shortly after PCI, at least one antiplatelet agent should be continued if at all possible; if oral antiplatelet agents must be discontinued, a short acting intravenous IIb/IIIa receptor blocker could be considered until shortly before non-cardiac surgery, though data are non-existent and this approach remains controversial. Clopidogrel should be restarted after surgery with a loading dose of 300 mg. In patients undergoing colonoscopy, the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is an independent predictor for advanced colon carcinoma.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Preoperative cardiac evaluation — functional capacity and stress testing recommendations indicate that stable patients with exercise capacity ≥ 4 METs are at relatively low risk for perioperative cardiac events. In the CARP trial of 510 patients with documented CAD (at least 1 lesion with ≥ 70% stenosis), those assigned to revascularization experienced a 36-day delay to surgery, and there was no difference in perioperative MI at 30 days or in all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Because the benefits of preoperative revascularization appear to be limited, routine preoperative stress testing should not be performed in patients with adequate functional capacity, and preoperative stress testing is not recommended in low-risk patients (eg, RCRI = 0) or in stable patients undergoing low-risk NCS. This applies to patients with or without known or suspected CAD or cardiovascular risk factors.

### Cost conscious care: preoperative evaluation by a cardiologist prior to low-risk procedures [^116nRDAK]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac risk assessments or preoperative risk evaluations are often performed prior to both surgical and non-surgical procedures. These assessments are performed by cardiologists as well as non-specialists. Despite current guidelines that provide algorithms for preoperative testing, the efficacy of these evaluations is unclear. Multiple reports have demonstrated overutilisation of preoperative testing, yet few studies have compared the utilisation of preoperative testing and outcomes between cardiologists and non-specialists. Recent data have suggested that consultation with a cardiologist for preoperative evaluation before intermediate-risk surgery does not affect adverse cardiovascular event rates. We sought to measure the effect of obtaining cardiology consultation for preoperative evaluation prior to a low-risk procedure on the volume of tests ordered and cost.

Hypothesis

Preoperative consultation with a cardiologist for cardiac risk assessment prior to a low-risk procedure results in increased testing and increased cost.

### Cardiac screening before noncardiac surgery [^111nTrRK]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications are infrequent but can result in significant morbidity following noncardiac surgery, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease or increased age. All patients require some level of preoperative screening to identify and minimize immediate and future risk, with a careful focus on known coronary artery disease or risks for coronary artery disease and functional capacity. The 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines are clear that noninvasive and invasive testing should be limited to circumstances in which results will clearly affect patient management or in which testing would otherwise be indicated. beta-Blocker therapy has become controversial in light of recent publications but should be continued in patients already on therapy, and started in patients with high cardiac risk undergoing intermediate- or high-risk surgery.

### Cost conscious care: preoperative evaluation by a cardiologist prior to low-risk procedures [^114iTxfU]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our data indicate that preoperative consultation to a cardiologist is associated with more preoperative testing. This preoperative testing increases the length of stay and cost. Future studies on the value of consultation to a cardiologist prior to low-risk procedures are warranted.

Special considerations for cancer patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease (CAD) — revascularization decisions should account for prognosis and bleeding risk. Decision making regarding revascularization in patients with active cancer must take into consideration the overall prognosis of the patient. For patients with stable angina, every effort should be made to maximally optimize medical therapy before resorting to an invasive strategy. FFR is recommended before non-urgent PCI to justify the need for revascularization. When an invasive approach is indicated, balloon angioplasty should be considered for cancer patients who are not candidates for DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy), and BMS should be considered. Bivalirudin and/or radial approach should be considered to minimize the risk of bleeding. Post intervention, intravascular imaging such as IVUS or optical coherence tomography (OCT) is recommended after stent placement to ensure optimal expansion and an absence of complications given the potential for early DAPT interruption.

### Clinical outcomes and utility of cardiac catheterization prior to superior cavopulmonary anastomosis [^116MuCop]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to characterize the outcomes of routine catheterization prior to superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and to determine if some patients were unlikely to benefit from catheterization and thus might be evaluated preoperatively with noninvasive methods alone.

Background

Congenital heart disease patients with single ventricle physiology undergo routine echocardiography and cardiac catheterization prior to superior cavopulmonary anastomosis to determine anatomic and hemodynamic suitability for this procedure.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all infants (n = 114) evaluated for potential superior cavopulmonary anastomosis at our institution from January 1997 to June 2000.

Results

Patients' median age was 5.5 months. Full echocardiograms were obtained in 79 patients (69%). At catheterization a total of 41 interventions were performed in 35 patients (31%). Twenty-seven patients (24%) were transfused, 18 patients (17%) required cardiac intensive care unit admission, and median length of stay following catheterization was 1 day (range 0 to 22). Complications occurred in 28 patients (25%), most transient. Of 51 patients who had complete echocardiograms without indication for catheterization, none subsequently had significant interventions and only 2 had new findings at catheterization. Three candidates were excluded from operation; all 111 others underwent successful procedures and survived to hospital discharge.

Conclusions

Interventions were frequent at catheterization prior to superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, but transient complications, transfusion, intensive care unit admission, and prolonged hospital length of stay were common. For patients in whom no issues indicating need for catheterization are identified by echocardiogram, routine catheterization rarely results in new information or intervention. These patients may be more safely evaluated preoperatively using exclusively noninvasive techniques.

Cost–value considerations for diagnostic testing — health economics seeks to assess the value associated with medical technology, but for diagnostic tests the relationship between test use and value is indirect and contingent; value may be created by not performing a test or, conversely, administration can lead to patient harm through cascades of additional testing or delays, so key cost–value considerations include the cost of the medical test, the context of administration, and the extent to which clinicians can use test results to improve patient health.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Medium credibility.

Vascular access and pre-procedural evaluation in cancer patients undergoing cardiac catheterization — prior to catheterization, all patients should be evaluated for their bleeding diathesis, the prothrombotic state and the potential for infection due to immunosuppression, and access routes should be carefully assessed with ultrasound guidance, micropuncture needles, and fluoroscopic guidance contributing to the best possible outcome. Femoral artery access has been associated with a higher risk of bleeding compared with radial artery access; puncture of the common femoral artery at its mid-section should be the goal, since access outside the CFA may lead to retroperitoneal hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, thrombosis, or excessive bleeding, and vascular closure devices do not seem to decrease bleeding compared with manual compression and should be avoided in immunocompromised patients. The radial artery is favored because of the lower bleeding risk and increased patient satisfaction, reductions in bleeding complications can be attained even in patients with TP receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, early ambulation favors fewer thrombosis complications, and anticoagulant administration remains a limitation for transradial diagnostic catheterizations. For anemia management, RBC transfusion is generally recommended when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL.

### Anomalous origin of a right pulmonary artery identified with echocardiography combined with CT: a case in a juvenile patient [^1132yuHp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, pulmonary angiography or cardiac catheterization is the ultimately reliable method for diagnosing AOPA, but they are invasive and expose patients to high doses of radiation. Due to family considerations regarding the lack of severe clinical symptoms in the child and the potential adverse factors mentioned above, cardiac catheterization was not acceptable. Studies have shown that TTE has a significant contribution to the non-invasive and accurate diagnosis of AOPA. TTE can clearly display the exact location and origin of AOPA, as well as other related malformations and hemodynamic changes. Furthermore, according to Mansi Verma's research, Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) helps provide precise anatomical depiction and identification of related anomalies, thereby assisting in preoperative planning for surgical intervention. In this report, we used a combination of TTE and CTA to clearly diagnose AOPA with PDA, but the pulmonary artery pressure provided by TTE seemed not to be suitable for further cardiac surgical correction. Surgical intervention is the only way to improve the long-term prognosis of the disease, and the therapeutic effect is closely related to age, category of malformation, and complexity. There have been reports of death after surgical treatment in patients with complex congenital heart malformations, making thorough preoperative assessment crucial. As Dr. Saurabh K demonstrated in a detailed multimodal hemodynamic assessment for a 15-year-old boy, and successfully managed the surgery based on the assessment results. Complex cardiac malformations with special hemodynamic changes, such multimodal hemodynamic assessment is well worth our reference to ensure good postoperative surgical outcomes for patients. However, in this specific case, it is difficult to make a choice between conservative treatment and surgical correction, as both carry significant risks. Although the TTE data seems to reflect a severe condition, the child has no severe clinical symptoms, and TTE indeed has limitations in examining complex congenital heart malformations. Therefore, after multidisciplinary discussion, it was decided to attempt surgical intervention, with a well-planned preoperative scheme, intraoperative attempts to close PDA and hemodynamic assessment by cardiac catheterization, and successful surgery after full assessment. Postoperatively, Bosentan medication was used as per the standard regimen, and the follow-up results were satisfactory.

Consequently, in this particular case, owing to the patient's inability to undergo invasive examinations, we opted for the diagnosis of the congenital heart malformation through TTE and CTA scans. After multidisciplinary consultation, surgical intervention was ultimately decided upon, resulting in a favorable prognosis for the patient.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Stress testing — cost–value considerations show differing test yields and downstream utilization. Exercise electrocardiographic results were 55.7% negative, 7.2% positive, and 37.1% inconclusive, whereas stress echocardiography results were 94.8% negative, 4.7% positive, and 0.5% inconclusive. Stress echocardiography was associated with fewer clinic and emergency visits, less coronary angiography (6.3% versus 13.4%; P = 0.02), lower mean costs (P = 0.04), and no difference in the composite of death, MI, unplanned revascularization, and hospitalization for chest pain (3.7% versus 3.2%; P = 0.38) at 3 years. Patients with good functional capacity and stable symptoms as well as low-risk patients undergoing low-risk NCS do not benefit from preoperative stress testing. Simulated results demonstrate that deferral of diagnostic testing in low-risk patients may be associated with greater patient health benefits and lower costs, with estimated cost reductions of −$749 (95% CI, −$1647 to −$158) in the PROMISE patients with 10% lowest risk and −$677 (95% CI, −$1383 to −$71) in the patients with 20% lowest risk.

Anesthesia risks in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) — complication patterns and cardiac arrest rates: Pediatric patients and especially patients with CHD are at increased risk for adverse events and cardiac arrest during surgery. In a prospective quality assurance audit of 24,165 anesthetics, respiratory issues comprised 53% of anesthesia issues and 12.5% of intraoperative adverse events; respiratory events were more common in infants under one year of age, intubated patients, and those with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA) PS 3 or 4, and cardiovascular events were also most common in ASA PS 3 or 4. In Brazil, 15,253 anesthetics showed risk factors including age < 1 year, ASA PS 3 or 4, emergency procedures, and preoperative intubation. Across 92,881 anesthetics, the cardiac arrest rate was 2.9/10,000 in noncardiac surgery and 127/10,000 in cardiac surgical procedures, with mortality 1.6/10,000; eighty-eight percent of those with cardiac arrest had CHD, and the highest rates were in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiac arrest 435/10,000 and mortality 389/10,000.

### Preoperative management of antiplatelet drugs for a coronary artery stent: how can we hit a moving target? [^116LRWEi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Existing Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with a Coronary Artery Stent

A recent systematic review identified 11 clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with a coronary stent who need non-cardiac surgery. These authors applied the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument (with a maximum score of 161) to assess the quality of the identified guidelines, Five of the 11 practice guidelines had an AGREE II score of > 100: American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons has also published updated guidelines on the management of antiplatelet therapy in cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients.

However, despite some having AGREE II scores of greater than 100, a paucity of available definitive evidence has resulted in perioperative coronary artery stent guidelines that are divergent and vague on key issues. Recommendations vary regarding the amount of time which must elapse between stent placement and elective surgery in order to have an acceptable risk of acute stent thrombosis when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is discontinued. If DAPT must be interrupted within this critical period due to the risk of bleeding, the recommended timing of aspirin and thienopyridine discontinuation also varies.

These existing guidelines provide well-defined — albeit contradictory — recommendations on how long elective procedures should be delayed following coronary stent placement. However, for patients needing urgent surgery, while still presumably requiring DAPT, the recommendations concerning antiplatelet medications become vague. Most of the guidelines simply advise somehow weighing the risk of stent thrombosis against the risk of bleeding and, if at all possible, continuing the DAPT therapy throughout the perioperative period. The most current ACC/AHA guidelines do thoroughly review many of the risks associated with both stent thrombosis and surgical bleeding, but the incorporation of these risks into the final recommendations is incomplete.

### Anticipated rates and costs of guideline-concordant preoperative stress testing [^117PKdi7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients have preoperative assessment of cardiac risk and functional status, and that patients at "elevated" cardiac risk with poor or unknown functional status be referred for preoperative stress testing. Little is known about current rates of testing or resultant medical costs. We set out to estimate the expected rates of preoperative stress testing and resultant costs if physicians in the United States were to follow current guidelines and to investigate differences that would arise from 2 risk prediction methods included in current guidelines.

Methods

We applied 2 risk prediction tools (Revised Cardiac Risk Index and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest) included in current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to a multicenter prospective registry of patients undergoing surgery in the United States in 2009. We then calculated expected rates of preoperative cardiac stress testing if physicians were to follow American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, expected nationwide direct medical expenditures that would result (in 2017 US dollars), and agreement beyond chance between the 2 risk prediction tools.

Results

Current guidelines recommend considerable spending on preoperative stress testing. Guideline-recommended spending would differ substantially depending on the risk prediction tool used and the reliability of the functional status assessment. Rates of testing and resultant spending are likely much greater among patients at "elevated" risk, compared with patients at "low" risk. Two guideline-recommended risk assessment tools, Revised Cardiac Risk Index and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest, have poor agreement beyond chance across the currently recommended risk threshold.

Conclusions

Preoperative stress testing is likely a considerable source of medical spending, despite unproven benefit. Which perioperative risk assessment tool clinicians should use, what risk thresholds are appropriate for patient selection, and the reliability of the functional status assessment all warrant further attention.

### Clinician agreement with perioperative cardiovascular evaluation guidelines and clinical outcomes [^114fieXm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published guidelines for preoperative cardiac risk stratification in 1996. Although clinician practice may differ from the guidelines, it remains unclear whether deviation from these guidelines affects clinical outcomes. This study sought to determine if discordance between clinician practice and the ACC/AHA guidelines affects perioperative cardiac outcomes. Eight hundred twenty-three patients who underwent 864 consecutive preoperative evaluations performed from 1995 to 1997 at a tertiary care academic medical center were prospectively followed. Clinician recommendations for preoperative cardiac testing were compared with ACC/AHA guideline recommendations. Frequencies of perioperative cardiac complications were compared between concordant and discordant testing recommendations. There were 33 perioperative cardiac complications (3.8%). Overall, there was no difference in the frequency of complications when there was discordance with the ACC/AHA guidelines compared with concordance (4.1% vs 3.7%, p = 0.81). The ACC/AHA guidelines recommended cardiac testing for 236 patients (27.3%). Clinicians ordered testing in half of those cases (n = 112). There was a lower frequency of cardiac complications when clinicians did not perform testing as recommended by the ACC/AHA guidelines (3.2% vs 10.7%, p = 0.02). Conversely, clinicians ordered cardiac testing in 45 patients (7%) when not recommended by the guidelines. Patients in this group had a trend toward more cardiac complications (6.7% vs 2.4%, p = 0.09). In conclusion, the failure of clinicians to follow the ACC/AHA guidelines when perioperative testing was recommended did not result in a higher frequency of cardiac complications.

The Challenges of Implementing Professional Society Practice Guidelines

Developing such clinical practice guidelines is a highly-structured, labor intensive process, involving a rigorous review and critical appraisal of the literature, multidisciplinary consultation, and grading of the resulting recommendations based on the quality of available evidence. Nevertheless, persistently variable success has been experienced in translating even well-grounded national clinical guidelines into local practice, including in the perioperative setting. Barriers to providers adopting such clinical guidelines include inadequate understanding, lack of agreement and perceived "real-world" practicality, concerns about loss of self-efficacy, low outcome expectations, and the inertia of existing practice.

In an October 2010 survey of United States Department of Veterans Affairs network physicians, 100% of anesthesiologists, 100% of cardiologists, but only 78% of surgeons were aware of the then current ACC/AHA Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery. Furthermore, among the survey respondents, 87% of anesthesiologists, 90% of cardiologists, but only 64% of surgeons agreed with these published guidelines. There was also significant variability among the three specialties in the perception of risk of coronary stent thrombosis versus bleeding and in the perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy with a BMS or a DES — with anesthesiologists and cardiologists emphasizing stent thrombosis risk and more often electing to continue antiplatelet therapy. Anecdotally, at our institution, we had encountered minimal success in achieving consistent adherence to these same previously published ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines for the preoperative management of patients with a coronary artery stent.

The Creation of a Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plan for Pre-Procedural Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with a Coronary Artery Stent

Neuman and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania have observed that the durability of class I guideline recommendations for procedures and treatments, promulgated by the ACC/AHA, have varied widely across individual guidelines and levels of evidence. Specifically, of 619 such ACC/AHA recommendations examined, 80.0% were retained in the subsequent guideline version, 9.2% were downgraded or reversed, and 10.8% were omitted. Downgrades, reversals, and omissions were most common among recommendations that were not supported by multiple randomized studies. As noted in the accompanying editorial, in order for practice guidelines to be most effective, they need to be kept up-to-date.

### Preoperative cardiovascular assessment in noncardiac surgery: an update [^111uP1AY]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac complications are a major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. These are caused by either myocardial ischaemia or acute coronary thrombosis. The preoperative assessment aims to collect information on the extent and the stability of the cardiovascular disease in order to predict the patient's risk for developing perioperative cardiac complications. This assessment allows measures to be taken that aim to reduce such risks. The present review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the preoperative assessment of the cardiac patient scheduled for noncardiac surgery.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association preoperative assessment guidelines reduce resource utilization before aortic surgery [^113Qe4xC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Methods used for evaluation of cardiac risk before noncardiac surgery vary widely. We evaluated the effect over time on practice and resource utilization of implementing the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Preoperative Risk Assessment.

Methods

We compared 102 historical control patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic surgery (from January 1993 to December 1994) with 94 consecutive patients after guideline implementation (from July 1995 to December 1996) and 104 patients in a late after guideline implementation (from July 1, 1997, to September 30, 1998). Resource use (testing, revascularization, and costs) and outcomes (perioperative death and myocardial infarction) were examined. Patients with and without clinical markers of risk for perioperative cardiac complications were compared.

Results

The use of preoperative stress testing (88% to 47%; P < .00001), cardiac catheterization (24% to 11%; P < .05), and coronary revascularization (25% to 2%; P < .00001) decreased between control and postguideline groups, respectively. These changes persisted in the late postguideline group. Mean preoperative evaluation costs also fell ($1087 versus $171; P < .0001). Outcomes of death (4% versus 3% versus 2%) and myocardial infarction (7% versus 3% versus 5%) were not significantly different between control, postguideline, and late postguideline groups, respectively. Stress test rates were similar for patients at low risk versus high risk in the historical control group (84% versus 91%; p = 0.29) but lower for patients at low risk after guideline implementation (31% versus 61%; p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cardiac risk assessment guidelines appropriately reduced resource use and costs in patients who underwent elective aortic surgery without affecting outcomes. This effect was sustained 2 years after guideline implementation.

### Patients with positive preoperative stress tests undergoing vascular surgery [^111dZ3Mg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery with beta-blockade after a positive stress test or cardiac catheterization.

Design

Retrospective review of a quality assurance database.

Setting

A university teaching hospital.

Participants

A consecutive series of 31 patients undergoing peripheral vascular or aortic surgery after a positive stress test or catheterization between November 2001 and September 2003.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

All 31 patients had a preoperative positive stress test and/or cardiac catheterization, with 12 having multiple areas at risk for myocardial ischemia. None had an intervening coronary revascularization. Twenty-seven had at least one of the intermediate clinical predictors as defined by the American College of Cardiology and 7 had a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. Twenty-three patients had been on a beta-blocker and continued on it, while the remainder started on it de novo perioperatively. None of the patients suffered from myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death perioperatively.

Conclusions

This case series reports on the authors' experience with patients undergoing high-risk vascular surgery after a positive stress test or catheterization, but without an intervening coronary intervention. All patients received perioperative beta-blockade and had a very low adverse cardiac event rate. With reduction of adverse events by beta-blockade, the likelihood of a positive event may be reduced and the utility of the test in risk stratification may be questioned.

The risk factors commonly identified in externally validated risk‐prediction models are shown in Figure 2. Preexisting CKD, although variably defined, is the strongest risk factor for AKI in this setting. With 2 exceptions, 59, 70 most other prediction tools have used sCr to assess kidney function, which may significantly overestimate kidney function, particularly in malnourished elderly populations. The eGFR, which accounts for age, race, and sex and is subject to similar limitations, is likely a more accurate estimation of kidney function in stable, elective patients. The use of both eGFR and sCr in this context assumes steady‐state kidney function, which is frequently not the case. Newly identified risk factors such as preoperative hemoglobin (anemia/transfusion load) and proteinuria have only been incorporated in recent models, whereas other risk factors have not been rigorously studied for their incremental value when added to existing risk‐prediction models (eg, days from cardiac catheterization to surgery). All risk‐prediction tools have shown only moderate calibration, suggesting significant heterogeneity in the underlying populations. 62 Because most risk‐prediction tools have been derived from clinical and administrative databases, they fail to capture acuity of illness, which may account for the calibration discrepancies and the difficulty in discrimination among the moderate‐ to high‐risk groups. Some measure or surrogate for hemodynamic stability is present in all published models whether it is characterized by surgical urgency or the presence of cardiogenic shock. It is likely that risk discrimination would improve if additional objectively defined clinical variables were included.

At a minimum, all patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgical procedures should undergo routine clinical assessment of AKI risk. This involves systematic evaluation of known susceptibilities for development of AKI such as CKD and albuminuria using preoperative sCr and urinalysis in all patients before surgery. 71, 72, 73 These results will help frame individualized risk for AKI while perhaps providing insight into patients' baseline renal function. Whenever possible, efforts should be made to obtain the patient's prior kidney‐function tests to ascertain true baseline function. In summary, the currently available preoperative risk‐assessment tools are beneficial in that they use commonly available data and identify low‐risk patients in the setting of traditional CVS. Nevertheless, they have several limitations:
They are predominantly used to predict RRT.
Sensitivity and specificity break down at the extremes of the spectrum.
They do not account for preoperative eGFR (primarily rely on sCr alone).

Although imaging is extensively used for pre-operative and procedural planning, it should be emphasised that data demonstrating improved clinical outcome secondary to the use of imaging are still limited. The collection of such data in clinical trials will be critical.

### Safety of continuing anticoagulation prior to cardiac catheterization in pediatric patients: a Los Angeles center experience [^111MHuWf]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anticoagulation is often held in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization based on adult guidelines and practices. In adults, oral anticoagulation agents are held (with or without heparin bridging) prior to cardiac catheterization due to concerns for potential bleeding complications. For femoral access, a recent consensus statement on best practices in the cardiac catheterization laboratory recommends holding warfarin until the international normalized ratio (INR) falls below 1.8 and holding direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for a minimum of 24–48 h based on the operator's perception of bleeding risk. However, evidence in adults has shown that cardiac catheterization-related bleeding risk is similar in uninterrupted vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy compared to interrupted therapy, and uninterrupted VKA therapy has a lower risk of bleeding compared to interrupted VKA therapy with heparin bridging. Similar findings have been demonstrated regarding hematoma formation between uninterrupted versus interrupted DOAC therapy prior to pacemaker or defibrillator implantation and prior to catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation.

In children undergoing cardiac catheterization, the incidence of bleeding or hematoma has been shown to be low at 0.6–0.8%. However, studies regarding the safety of performing a cardiac catheterization while on systemic anticoagulation are lacking. A survey conducted in 2018 demonstrated significant variation in preoperative antiplatelet agent and intraoperative anticoagulation practices among providers performing cardiac catheterization in children and adults with congenital heart disease. Although the study only assessed practices regarding aspirin, clopidogrel, and intraprocedural heparin, it is likely that variability also exists in pre-procedural anticoagulation practices involving other systemic anticoagulation agents. At our heart center, we typically do not hold anticoagulation prior to cardiac catheterization. Here, we report our outcomes in a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent cardiac catheterization while on uninterrupted anticoagulation.

### SCAI expert consensus update on best practices in the cardiac catheterization laboratory: this statement was endorsed by the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) in April 2021 [^116dZQVN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

Universal protocol and time-out — team members should confirm the intended procedure using a dedicated "time out" performed before vascular access or moderate sedation when all team members are present, and patient identification should be confirmed with unanimous agreement on the procedure; because coronary access can be obtained via multiple arteries, site marking is not indicated for cardiac procedures; universal infection precautions should be followed; all solutions must be labeled in real-time and preprinted labels and blank labels should be available; for ad-hoc coronary interventions a "Pre-PCI time out" should be considered covering appropriate use, radiation and contrast, the need for intravascular imaging or physiologic assessment, dual-antiplatelet therapy, pre-treatment with aspirin and P2Y12- receptor inhibitors, and baseline hemodynamics; a pre-PCI time out assumes more importance if another operator is performing PCI; for structural heart interventions, incorporate procedural specifics such as for TAVR (valve type, size, implantation angle, surgical bailout strategy), and the implanting physician must ensure proper valve orientation; finally, verbal orders should be documented by the technologist or nurse and confirmed by the performing physician at case close with a signature.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116ZUsDf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in preoperative risk assessment can improve risk estimation among patients who will experience perioperative major adverse cardiac events (MACE); however, compared with clinical risk scores, CCTA is > 5 times as likely to inappropriately overestimate risk among patients who will not experience MACE, which may result in delay or cancellation of surgery and increased resource use. Low-risk patients include those at low risk by validated tools and those undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery, and in these patients, or those with functional capacity ≥ 4 METs with stable symptoms, the probability of uncovering high-risk coronary anatomy that would adversely affect surgical outcomes is small. This recommendation is applicable to patients with or without known or suspected CAD or cardiovascular risk factors.

### Do vascular surgery patients need a cardiology work-up? A review of pre-operative cardiac clearance guidelines in vascular surgery [^111vrSNT]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

to outline the appropriate pre-operative cardiac work-up for patients who are scheduled for major peripheral vascular surgery.

Design

review of the literature.

Materials and Methods

a review of the literature focusing on studies that have correlated the pre-operative cardiac work-up patients receive to the cardiac morbidity and mortality following vascular surgery. Only studies with level A evidence were included.

Results

peri-operative beta blockade has been shown to decrease cardiac complications after vascular surgery in all risk groups. Non-invasive cardiac testing is only necessary for patients in the intermediate/high risk group. Coronary revascularization should only be considered after a positive non-invasive cardiac test.

Conclusions

patients must be risk stratified pre-operatively based on history and physical examination. Low risk patients should receive peri-operative beta blockade only with no further non-invasive testing. On the other hand, intermediate and high risk patients should undergo non-invasive cardiac testing before going to the operating room.

### Characteristics of cardiac catheterization patients… [^111oQSWS]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

articleid = 1893784) recommend revascularization before noncardiac surgery only in selected circumstances. 1 Furthermore, a decision to intervene with PCI needs to be weighed against the risk of deferring surgery and increased risk of adverse cardiac events if surgery is performed early after stent placement. 4 Despite these issues, the practice of preoperative revascularization persists, with nearly 19 000 patients in the 2010–2011 CathPCI Registry having a PCI performed in this setting. 2 Data on these PCI procedures remain limited. Preoperative stress testing was performed in 126 766, not performed in 2484, and unknown in 65 194 of the overall cohort. Among patients who underwent preoperative stress tests, myocardial perfusion imaging accounted for most tests performed followed by stress echocardiography.

In this large, contemporary US registry, we found that most clinically stable patients undergoing diagnostic catheterization before noncardiac surgery are asymptomatic. However, there is a high prevalence of cardiac risk factors and prior CAD, and most patients have had a positive stress test result. Obstructive CAD by angiography is common, and revascularization is recommended in nearly half of these patients. The dilemma in identifying obstructive CAD in the preoperative setting is that randomized clinical trials have not identified a benefit of subsequent revascularization. The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis trial was the largest randomized clinical trial to address this question. There are sparse contemporary registry data of preoperative angiography and/or PCI in patients with stable CAD. To our knowledge, the only previous study22 described 2592 preoperative PCI procedures performed during 7 years in a Michigan registry.

Compared with patients undergoing elective PCI, preoperative patients had greater comorbidities and were more likely to receive bare metal stents. Our findings draw attention to a further challenge in preoperative PCI: the choice of stent and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy. As expected, our study indicates that drug-eluting stents are used much less often in the preoperative setting than in elective PCI, 2 likely because the succeeding 12 months of DAPT can lead to an unacceptable deferral of surgery.
