## Question

Normocytic anemia next steps in evaluation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended next steps in evaluating a patient with normocytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming anemia and true normocytic indices with an initial lab panel and smear. Then, I should verify the reticulocyte response to classify hemolysis/blood loss versus hypoproliferation. Next, I will examine cause-directed pathways: hemolysis evaluation if reticulocytes are high, and production failure workup if reticulocytes are low. After that, I should review context-specific branches such as chronic kidney disease, cancer/chemotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease, and older adults. Finally, I need to consider thresholds for marrow examination, transfusion/ESA decisions, and how to monitor response to therapy.

> Let me first confirm the basics and not skip steps: I should confirm hemoglobin is below the laboratory lower limit of normal and that MCV is truly 80–100 fL on a repeat CBC with differential, then immediately obtain an absolute reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, ferritin and transferrin saturation, and an inflammatory marker such as CRP to anchor the initial classification and avoid missing mixed etiologies [^112sp2gt] [^116oqmLu] [^113hDmon].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with MCV alone — initially I thought an MCV-based algorithm would be sufficient, but I should double-check because MCV-guided classification can miss etiologies and delay diagnosis, so a broader set of labs and reticulocyte assessment is needed from the outset [^112FPnFF].

> Next, I should review marrow responsiveness by reticulocyte output; a corrected reticulocyte index or absolute reticulocyte count distinguishes increased RBC loss/destruction from impaired production, so a high reticulocyte response suggests hemolysis or acute blood loss, whereas a low reticulocyte response implies hypoproliferation or marrow suppression — let me verify this aligns with CKD and general anemia guidance, which it does [^116oqmLu] [^112sp2gt].

> If the reticulocyte count is elevated, I will now examine hemolysis: I need to check LDH, unconjugated bilirubin, and haptoglobin, obtain a direct antiglobulin test to separate immune from nonimmune etiologies, and scrutinize the smear for spherocytes, schistocytes, bite cells, or other morphologic clues; if DAT is positive, I should confirm thermal amplitude and consider cold agglutinin titers per BSH to refine the immune hemolysis subtype, and if DAT is negative yet hemolysis persists, I should reconsider membranopathies, enzymopathies, or hemoglobinopathies, stepping through a staged inherited hemolysis workup if routine studies are unrevealing [^111kLtJd] [^1155E4cJ] [^117CB9GZ].

> Wait, let me verify whether a reflex approach can help here in recent-onset normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis; evidence suggests automatic lab-initiated reticulocytes and DAT in appropriate contexts can expedite recognition of autoimmune hemolysis, which can be diagnostically helpful when clinicians have not yet suspected it [^1156YiHZ].

> If the reticulocyte count is low, I need to ensure I evaluate common hypoproliferative causes systematically: check kidney function and eGFR for CKD-related EPO deficiency, assess inflammation with CRP/ESR, screen endocrine contributors such as thyroid disease where indicated, evaluate nutritional contributors with B12 and folate, and assess hepatic function, all while confirming iron status, since early iron deficiency or functional iron restriction can still present as normocytic before microcytosis appears [^116oqmLu] [^112sp2gt] [^112qcPhA].

> Let me think about iron status more carefully because interpretation is often the pivot: serum ferritin is the single most useful initial marker, but in the setting of inflammation I should confirm with transferrin saturation and, when available, reticulocyte hemoglobin or the percentage of hypochromic red cells to identify functional iron deficiency; in inflammatory states like IBD, ferritin above 100 mcg/L with TSAT below 20% supports anemia of chronic disease, whereas ferritin below about 30 mcg/L or TSAT below 20% strongly suggests absolute deficiency even if MCV is normal early on, so I should double-check for mixed etiologies and not over-rely on a single marker [^114N2wZa] [^117EMSCv] [^1162718v] [^114CUyEC].

> For CKD, I should confirm pathophysiology and testing cadence: anemia is typically normocytic and hypoproliferative due to EPO deficiency compounded by iron-restricted erythropoiesis, so I need a CBC, absolute reticulocytes, ferritin, TSAT, and consideration of reticulocyte hemoglobin or % hypochromic RBCs to gauge iron delivery to marrow; this helps determine iron repletion strategies and timing of ESA initiation after iron optimization [^115y47Jv] [^116oqmLu] [^112sp2gt].

> In patients with cancer or on myelosuppressive chemotherapy, I should confirm I'm not attributing anemia solely to therapy without excluding other causes; I need to check a thorough drug exposure history, reticulocytes, iron/B12/folate indices, renal function, smear review, consider DAT in lymphoproliferative disorders, and reserve marrow examination for unexplained cytopenias or suspected marrow disease before considering ESAs or transfusion decisions, correcting reversible causes first [^1129kt37] [^113h86KQ] [^113phhGj].

> For inflammatory bowel disease, I should confirm a comprehensive anemia panel when hemoglobin is below normal that includes RBC indices, reticulocytes, ferritin, TSAT, and CRP, adding B12, folate, hemolysis labs, and reticulocyte hemoglobin or % hypochromic RBCs when needed to delineate absolute versus functional iron deficiency and mixed etiologies, and if the cause remains unclear after appropriate workup, I should consult hematology [^112qcPhA] [^115gs2r8] [^116CdVeY].

> In older adults, let me reconsider when to escalate: persistent normocytic anemia without an identifiable cause after an appropriate evaluation warrants attention to MDS and other marrow disorders, so if cytopenias are present or the smear is abnormal, I should confirm indications for bone marrow examination and consider molecular studies as guided by hematology, while also ensuring evaluation for occult gastrointestinal bleeding if iron deficiency is suspected or confirmed [^113HMPXu] [^1127BjcC] [^115bHVQo].

> Next, I should review clear triggers for bone marrow evaluation and hematology referral: pancytopenia, abnormal cells on smear suggesting dysplasia or blasts, suspected aplastic anemia or MDS, or an unexplained normocytic anemia after the above workup are appropriate thresholds, and persistent diagnostic uncertainty despite context-specific evaluations should prompt specialist involvement [^1127BjcC] [^116CdVeY].

> I need to ensure supportive care decisions are evidence-based; for transfusion, I should consider RBC transfusion without delay in patients with Hb below about 7–8 g/dL or those with severe anemia-related symptoms requiring rapid improvement, while in oncology populations I should also align with ASCO/ASH guidance and address non-chemotherapy etiologies before ESAs, individualizing thresholds based on comorbidity and symptoms [^113phhGj] [^111i1fLE] [^1129kt37].

> Finally, I will now examine response monitoring to confirm that my working diagnosis is correct: for iron deficiency, I should expect a reticulocyte rise within several days and an Hb increase of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks as a strong supportive signal of absolute deficiency even if baseline studies were equivocal, and in CKD or inflammatory states I should track reticulocyte hemoglobin or % hypochromic RBCs where available to ensure iron delivery improves with therapy; if the anticipated kinetic response fails to appear, I should double-check adherence, ongoing blood loss, inflammation, or an alternate diagnosis [^1149wkcb] [^112sp2gt].

The next steps in evaluating normocytic anemia are to **confirm anemia and MCV** with a repeat CBC [^116SeqRE], then **classify by reticulocyte count** [^113hDmon] to distinguish increased destruction/loss from decreased production [^111kLtJd]. Order **iron studies** (ferritin, transferrin saturation) [^114CUyEC] [^114N2wZa], renal and liver function tests, TSH [^113h86KQ], and inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR) [^112sp2gt] to identify common causes [^113hDmon]. If reticulocytes are high, **assess for hemolysis** (LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, direct antiglobulin test) [^111kLtJd] and consider hemoglobinopathies; if low, **evaluate for marrow failure** or chronic disease, and consider bone marrow biopsy [^1127BjcC] if unexplained cytopenias or abnormal smear are present. Management is directed by the underlying cause, with transfusion or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents as indicated [^111i1fLE] [^116oqmLu].

---

## Confirm anemia and normocytic classification

Confirm anemia and a **normocytic MCV** with a repeat CBC, defining anemia as a hemoglobin below the laboratory-specific lower limit [^111ULGRj] and an MCV of 80–100 fL. Then **review RBC indices** (RDW, MCH, MCHC) for additional diagnostic clues [^113hDmon] [^112qcPhA] [^112FPnFF].

---

## Initial laboratory evaluation

### Reticulocyte count

Classify anemia by the **reticulocyte count** [^116oqmLu] [^113hDmon]: high values indicate a hyperproliferative process, while low or normal values indicate hypoproliferation [^116116vp].

---

### Iron studies

**Ferritin** is the most useful marker in the iron panel [^114N2wZa]; add transferrin saturation when ferritin may be falsely normal [^114CUyEC] [^116cC5xS].

---

### Renal and liver function tests

Assess **creatinine and eGFR** [^116oqmLu] to evaluate for CKD-related anemia [^112sp2gt], and obtain a liver panel to evaluate for liver disease that may contribute to anemia [^111bDP7o].

---

### Inflammatory markers

Use **CRP and ESR** to identify inflammation [^112sp2gt], which suggests anemia of chronic disease [^1162718v].

---

### Thyroid function tests

Obtain **TSH** to screen for hypothyroidism as a reversible cause of anemia [^113h86KQ].

---

## Peripheral blood smear

Review **morphology** on the peripheral smear to identify schistocytes, spherocytes, blasts, or dysplasia [^111kLtJd] [^111G7Dja]; these findings guide further testing [^113hDmon].

---

## Further evaluation based on reticulocyte count

### Elevated reticulocyte count (hyperproliferative anemia)

- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and DAT [^1155E4cJ] to confirm and classify hemolysis [^111kLtJd].

- **Hemoglobinopathies**: Consider hemoglobin electrophoresis if suspected [^113h86KQ].

- **Acute blood loss**: Evaluate for recent bleeding [^11693D6F].

---

### Normal or low reticulocyte count (hypoproliferative anemia)

- **CKD**: Assess renal function and consider erythropoietin deficiency [^115y47Jv] [^112sp2gt].

- **Chronic disease**: Evaluate for inflammatory or malignant conditions [^113hDmon].

- **Bone marrow disorders**: Consider marrow failure syndromes (e.g. aplastic anemia, MDS) [^1127BjcC].

---

## Indications for bone marrow biopsy

- **Unexplained anemia**: Persistent anemia after initial workup [^113HMPXu] [^113hDmon].

- **Cytopenias**: Unexplained leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.

- **Abnormal smear**: Blasts or dysplastic changes [^111G7Dja].

- **Suspected marrow failure**: Aplastic anemia, MDS, or infiltrative disease [^1127BjcC].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the underlying cause, such as CKD, chronic disease, or hemolysis. Provide **red blood cell transfusion** for severe symptomatic anemia or hemoglobin less than 7–8 g/dL [^113phhGj]. Consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for CKD- or cancer-related anemia [^111i1fLE] [^116oqmLu].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Monitor **response** by tracking hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and clinical status. Adjust treatment based on response and adverse effects.

---

The evaluation of normocytic anemia should be **systematic and stepwise**, starting with confirmation and reticulocyte-based classification, followed by targeted labs and smear review, and escalating to marrow assessment when indicated [^116116vp] [^113hDmon].

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem that is often discovered on routine laboratory tests. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians. The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary.

The evaluation begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include the red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear; further testing is guided by the results of these studies. Treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying cause of the anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

### Hemolytic anemia: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both.

Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension.

Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies.

Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms.

A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^115y47Jv]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as the kidney disease progresses.

- **Pathophysiology**: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in EPO production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.

- **Disease course**: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased quality of life, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48–5.26).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^112HYMu9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has expanded due to the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme synthesis. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, and therefore these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, and recommendations, and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

This discussion involves a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This scenario is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises questions about both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (e.g. antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical considerations. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation through history, a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia is undertaken when testing has not been recently performed. This includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review. The peripheral smear specifically assesses for red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and leukemia disorders.

### How I diagnose non-thalassemic microcytic anemias [^112AkgfE]. Seminars in Hematology (2015). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, microcytic anemia can be caused by acquired sideroblastic anemia, hereditary sideroblastic anemia, beta thalassemia minor, alpha thalassemia trait, sideroblastic anemia, anemia of chronic inflammation, hereditary atransferrinemia, iron deficiency anemia, and lead poisoning.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^117NdERU]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning indications for screening in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia panel. This includes a complete blood count (CBC), absolute reticulocyte count, serum ferritin level, and serum transferrin saturation. Additionally, the measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be part of the initial evaluation of anemia in patients with CKD, irrespective of age and CKD stage.

### An effective and efficient testing protocol for diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia preoperatively [^114zFjPX]. Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is a common perioperative condition and increases perioperative morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis and treatment are important. This retrospective cohort study tested the hypothesis that a newly developed preprocedure evaluation protocol diagnoses more patients with iron-deficiency anemia than the traditional practice of obtaining a complete blood count followed by iron studies.

- **Methods**: The preprocedure anemia evaluation is an order for a complete blood count and reflex anemia testing, which can be completed with a single patient visit. A hemoglobin concentration of 12 g/dl or less with serum ferritin concentration less than 30 ng/ml or transferrin saturation less than 20% defined iron-deficiency anemia. Northwestern Medicine's database was queried for preoperative clinic patients, age 16 to 89 years, before (2015 to 2016) and after (2017 to 2018) protocol implementation. The proportion of patients diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before and after the preprocedure anemia evaluation implementation was compared.

- **Results**: Before implementing the protocol, 8,816 patients were screened with a traditional complete blood count. Subsequent iron studies at the providers' discretion diagnosed 107 (1.2%) patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Some patients were still screened with a complete blood count after implementing the protocol; 154 of 4,629 (3.3%) patients screened with a complete blood count and 738 of 2,828 (26.1%) patients screened with the preprocedure anemia evaluation were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children should be screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but they should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition diagnosed through laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist, and laboratory markers provide important information.

- **Acute anemia**: Presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss.
- **Chronic anemia**: May present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain.

Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SWdKS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and concentrations of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (TfS), and C-reactive protein (CRP). In patients with postoperative Crohn's disease (CD) or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated.

In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin (Hb), lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and are further discussed in the outlook section.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are frequently encountered in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^113Ke5jb]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Prior to the meeting, we sent out a structured survey inquiring about local guidelines for the management of severe anaemia, including two specific questions on haemoglobin testing. Most clinicians reported that their guidelines and practice aim to follow WHO guidelines. These guidelines include recommendations that restrict routine transfusion to only those with haemoglobin levels less than 40 g/l (haematocrit < 12%) or 40–50 g/l if they present additional signs of severity. Nevertheless, the evidence base for the paediatric guidelines is weak, leading to confusing recommendations within these guidelines and poor adherence. However, the guidelines provide no specific guidance on clinical or haematological post-admission monitoring of children to identify those who subsequently develop new severity criteria warranting transfusion.

We asked about the most common method used for anaemia diagnosis [POC Hb, haematocrit, or full blood count (haemogram)] and how long it generally took to get haemoglobin/haematocrit (or haemogram) results. Most indicated it would take between 1 and 8 hours, and 10% indicated the following day. Haemoglobin testing was reliably available in just under 40% of those facilities. A recent publication on transfusion practice in Kenyan hospitals showed that, after adjusting for such features as severe illness, children for whom a transfusion was ordered and given on the same day had lower mortality [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38–0.87] than those whose transfusion was delayed (≥ 1 day after prescription).

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^116vjNHY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition of lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression and may thus become a comorbidity. Because several different types of chemical agents may be required for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of testing, perhaps 50–60 mL. Often, local and reference laboratories request larger samples than are really necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. My experience shows that a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Impact of an anemia diagnostic management team on follow-up test ordering by primary care providers [^116cNnN8]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia is a complex condition with diverse causes and poses diagnostic challenges amid the expanding landscape of laboratory testing. The implementation of an anemia diagnostic management team (DMT) can aid healthcare providers in navigating this complexity.

- **Methods**: This quasi-experimental study assessed the impact of an anemia DMT on laboratory test ordering by primary care providers for anemic patients. The study included adult patients (≥ 18 years) with anemia (hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women, hemoglobin < 13.0 g/dL for men) presenting to a family medicine clinic. Cases reviewed by the DMT (n = 100) were compared with a control group (n = 95).

- **Results**: The DMT recommended additional testing for 76 patients. Significantly more patients in the DMT group underwent follow-up tests compared with controls (59% vs. 34%; P < .001). Moreover, the DMT group underwent a higher mean number of tests per patient (1.70 ± 2.2 vs. 0.95 ± 1.9; p = 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Implementation of an anemia DMT influenced follow-up testing patterns in anemic patients, potentially enhancing diagnostic thoroughness and patient care.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: A neglected essential diagnostic test [^111Ks7uB]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in stark contrast to other areas of the world, children are the main recipients of blood transfusions, where severe anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) < 60 g/l] remains a leading cause of both admission to hospital and direct mortality. Owing to limited supplies of donated blood, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines encourage restrictive transfusion approaches. Specifically, these conservative strategies recommend not transfusing children with uncomplicated anaemia (haemoglobin of 40–60 g/l). However, the evidence informing these recommendations was previously weak and thus adherence was poor. Delays in the provision of an emergency transfusion in children are common, with early fatalities occurring in children awaiting a transfusion.

In 2019, a large multicentre phase III trial (TRACT) enrolling 3,983 children with severe anaemia in four hospitals in Uganda and Malawi provided high-quality evidence to support and refine treatment guidelines. Within the trial, 1,565 children with uncomplicated severe anaemia (haemoglobin 40–60 g/l and no severity features) were randomised to immediate (experimental) versus no immediate transfusions (control: WHO standard of care). In this stratum, initial (for control) or additional transfusions were permitted if prompted or 'triggered' by the development of new severity signs or post-randomisation haemoglobin < 40 g/l. Overall, the TRACT trial found no evidence of differences in 28-day mortality, 180-day mortality, or readmissions between immediate and triggered transfusion strategies.

### A novel discriminating tool for microcytic anemia in childhood [^1111iHR7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Accurate and timely interpretation of microcytic anemia can be diagnostically challenging in the primary care setting. We sought to develop a novel model for distinguishing iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia trait in the modern pediatric population. Demographic history and red blood cell indices were retrospectively characterized for 76 children referred to our pediatric hematology clinic for evaluation of microcytic anemia. Statistically significant variables were sequentially added into a logistic regression model to develop the final model. The final discriminating model incorporates red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell values. Favorable predictive performance is seen in the initial cohort (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 92.3%) and external validation cohort (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 88.9%). This novel tool may aid in determining the cause of hypochromic, microcytic anemia in the primary care setting. Finally, the study cohort reflects an underrepresented group in the development of screening tools, which offers generalizability.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests based on the initial assessment to diagnose the cause of anemia in selected cases:

- **Serum B12 and serum folate concentrations**: These tests help determine if vitamin deficiencies are contributing to anemia.

- **Tests for hemolysis**: This includes plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and Coombs' test. These tests evaluate for the destruction of red blood cells.

- **Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis**: This assesses abnormalities in protein levels and distribution.

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: This test checks for different types of hemoglobin that may indicate specific blood disorders.

- **Free light chains and bone marrow examination**: These are recommended to further investigate the underlying causes of anemia and assess bone marrow function.

### Automatic laboratory-initiated reflex testing to identify patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1156YiHZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical usefulness of automatic laboratory-initiated testing of patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is uncertain. During a 28-month period, we performed 784,185 complete blood count (CBC) tests. Patients without a history of anemia had reticulocyte count testing if hemoglobin values were less than 10 g/dL. Of the 784,185 CBC counts, 3,841 (0.49%) revealed recent-onset normocytic anemia, with 424 (11.04%) exhibiting reticulocyte counts of 2% or more. Among those with elevated reticulocyte counts, 52 (12.3%) had positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) results. Patient information was available for 40 individuals. Physicians were unaware of the existence of AIHA in 33 (83%) of them. Of the 40 patients, 11 (28%) were treated with steroids and 6 (15%) were hospitalized; in 2 patients (5%), medications were stopped because they were suspected of causing the hemolytic anemia. Automatic laboratory testing for patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia ensures recommended practices, likely reduces the need for physician visits, and, for some patients, results in more timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: Improvement with blood glucose control [^116bKycw]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients, we undertook a retrospective review of medical records. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study.

In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 ± 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 ± 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 ± 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 ± 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 ± 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 ± 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 ± 1.7% (P < 0.001; confidence interval, 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 ± 0.9 g/dL (P < 0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 ± 1.9% (P < 0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: Does it matter [^116jf1dw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In our study, 51.4% of the patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 30.9% had macrocytic anemia, 16.0% had microcytic anemia, and 1.7% had dimorphic anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, based on MCV and low serum ferritin levels, was seen only in 1 of 29 patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS. However, the interpretation of routine lab parameters such as serum ferritin is extremely difficult in liver cirrhosis, and bone-marrow staining for iron with Prussian blue is required for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

A total of 58 patients had macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL); of these, 56 had macrocytic anemia on PBS and 2 had dimorphic anemia. The remaining 51.4% of patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, the most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. We also found a significant correlation between MELD score and macrocytosis.

There was a significant correlation between the MELD score and Hb levels in our study. Lower Hb levels were associated with a higher MELD score. Similar findings were seen in a study conducted by Scheiner et al, where anemic patients showed a higher MELD (12 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 3; P < 0.001). In a study conducted by Jain et al, 88 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis were divided into 5 groups according to their MELD scores. It was found that hematological abnormalities, such as anemia and leucopenia, were more common in the higher MELD score group. Studies have shown that anemia is a poor prognostic factor in patients with liver cirrhosis, and the severity of anemia increases with the stage.

### The variable manifestations of disease in pyruvate kinase deficiency and their management [^117CB9GZ]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Advanced diagnostic workup of a patient with unidentified Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia should be considered after basic testing, such as peripheral blood film and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Often, many of these tests will be indicated in such a patient and may be obtained in a stepwise fashion to diagnose the underlying disorder.

- **Our consensus stepwise approach**: The initial workup includes hemolysis testing performed routinely. The second-pass workup is intended to rule out relatively common inherited entities, including hemoglobinopathies not identified in the initial assessment, as well as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, particularly relevant if the patient presents in adulthood. The third-pass workup allows for identification of pyruvate kinase deficiency and red cell membrane abnormalities not diagnosed in prior steps. If this three-step workup is unrevealing, additional testing is recommended to diagnose particularly rare inherited and acquired causes of hemolytic anemia.

The diagnostician may narrow or broaden the workup at each step as appropriate and as testing is available. For example, molecular PKLR and KLF1 testing can be reasonably performed earlier in the workup. Additionally, the clinician should be aware that many specialized tests are poorly standardized between laboratories. Deficiency may result in a hemolytic picture due to ineffective erythropoiesis; folate may be low in chronic hereditary anemias due to rapid cell turnover.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112ZPDVr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, anaemia of CKD is normochromic and normocytic and is morphologically indistinguishable from the anaemia of chronic illness. Initial assessment of anaemia in CKD patients should aim at identifying other factors that may influence the response to treatment.

In addition to Hb, other indices of the FBC report may provide important clinical information:

- **Macrocytosis**: Could be due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency.
- **Microcytosis**: In addition to anaemia of CKD, could be due to iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathies.
- **Macrocytosis with leucopoenia or thrombocytopenia**: Could be due to several factors such as alcohol intake, nutritional deficits (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), or myelodysplasia.
- **Serum folate**: More prone to variation and can be affected by the patient's diet immediately prior to blood being taken, alcohol, trauma, and other factors; therefore, occasionally red cell folate may need to be measured where serum folate is equivocal.
- **Haemolysis**: Suggested by the presence of macrocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase, and positive Coombs test.
- **Normal absolute reticulocyte count**: Ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 cells/μL. Although it has a significant inter-patient variability, this test may be useful as a semi-quantitative marker of erythropoietic activity.

- **Evaluating iron status in anaemic patients with CKD**:

	- The aim of evaluating iron status is to assess:
	- Iron level in tissue stores
	- The adequacy of iron utilisation for erythropoiesis.

	- Serum ferritin level is the only available blood marker of storage iron.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^115kG2fk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency in pregnancy remains underdiagnosed despite professional society recommendations for first-trimester complete blood count (CBC) screening. To determine the effectiveness of the CBC hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) to identify iron deficiency in pregnancy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 20,550 pregnancies from 2009 to 2022 at the University of California, San Francisco, obstetrics clinics. A total of 16,547 (80.5%) pregnant individuals had first-trimester screening CBC; 345 (2.1%) had a coincident ferritin test. Hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dL and MCV level less than 80 fL each had sensitivity of only 30% (95% CI, 20–41%) to detect first-trimester iron deficiency (ferritin level less than 30), corresponding to a negative likelihood ratio of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.77–1.05) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73–0.99), respectively. More than 50% of the 1,749 women with documented iron deficiency anytime during pregnancy were neither anemic nor microcytic at the time of diagnosis.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111F7q5A]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The investigation of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, which supports targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even when following previous guidelines that advise the investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases. The majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to consider that premenopausal women may occasionally develop cancer in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is sometimes justification for investigating younger women, particularly if the IDA is severe, recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses.

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables, specifically age, sex, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. The IDIOM app has been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform patient discussions regarding the potential benefits of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process through the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow for the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

- **Thorough drug exposure history**: To evaluate potential contributing factors.

- **Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination**: Particularly in some cases to identify underlying hematologic issues.

- **Laboratory tests**: Including TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, and hemoglobinopathy screening, where indicated.

- **Reticulocyte count**: To assess bone marrow activity.

- **Occult blood loss and assessment for renal insufficiency**: To determine potential sources of anemia.

- **Baseline EPO level**: For understanding erythropoiesis status.

- **Serum TSH**: Where indicated, to evaluate thyroid function.

- **Direct Coombs test**: Recommended for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a history of autoimmune disease.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia.

In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo-, or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

- **Methods**: The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anemia in primary care. Seven etiologies of anemia were defined based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) suggests iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and renal anemia as anemia etiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and renal anemia as anemia etiology.

- **Results**: Data of 4,129 patients were analyzed. One anemia etiology could be assigned to 2,422 (59%) patients, more than one anemia etiology to 888 (22%) patients, and uncertainty regarding the etiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3,505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anemia etiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anemia etiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

- **Conclusions**: Anemia etiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV-guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis.

When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Other possible etiologies include hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (such as myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders), which are some of the more common causes.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits. There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines can provide additional guidance.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias. These subcategories are not mutually exclusive.

In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination, along with appropriate laboratory test results, can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians in taking care of children by conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC, particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history, and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

- **Complete blood count**: Obtain a CBC to evaluate the overall health of the blood.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: A crucial parameter to assess the production of red blood cells.

- **Serum ferritin level**: This is necessary to evaluate the iron stores in the body.

- **Serum transferrin saturation**: Important for assessing how well iron is being carried in the bloodstream.

- **Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels**: To rule out deficiencies that could contribute to anemia.

### New challenges in evaluating anemia in older persons in the era of molecular testing [^1173kyTL]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in older persons and often remains unexplained despite a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory testing, including marrow aspiration, biopsy, and karyotyping. The advent of molecular genetic testing panels in hematology clinical practice has complicated the evaluation of older patients with unexplained anemia.

While the presence of a somatic mutation provides evidence of clonal hematopoiesis and may support a diagnosis of a hematologic neoplasm such as one of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), individual mutations, with rare exceptions, are not strongly associated with one specific diagnosis, nor are they by themselves diagnostic of neoplasia. A clonal mutation in a patient with cytopenias and a nondiagnostic bone marrow may indicate a syndrome with a similar natural history to MDS, but at present, there are no clear criteria to distinguish cytopenias coincidentally seen in association with an unrelated clonal mutation from cytopenias directly caused by that mutation.

Ongoing and planned analyses will help define when mutation patterns alone can identify a disorder equivalent to a morphologically defined myeloid neoplasm such as MDS, further clarifying the etiology and natural history of unexplained anemia in the elderly.

Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make their decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Etiologies and outcomes of normocytic anemia in children [^111ZNY4f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

To characterize the evaluation and outcomes of children referred to pediatric hematology for normocytic anemia, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study included children aged 0–21 years who were referred to a tertiary pediatric hematology clinic for normocytic anemia from 2019 through 2021. Normocytic anemia was defined as a low hemoglobin level and normal mean corpuscular volume, according to the referring laboratory reference range.

Two hundred seventy-one patients (48% female, median age 5.4 years) were included. The most common hematologic diagnoses were iron deficiency (n = 90, 33%), statistical anemia (n = 64, 24%), transient marrow suppression (n = 36, 13%), and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC, n = 19, 7%). There were 17 patients (6%) in whom anemia was attributed to a non-hematologic disorder, leading to referrals to other pediatric specialties. Additionally, 16 patients (6%) experienced spontaneous resolution of anemia without an identified underlying etiology. Beyond those with iron deficiency, 35 patients (13%) were diagnosed with conditions necessitating ongoing hematology care, including transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, hemolytic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and abnormal beta-globin traits. Ultimately, 251 patients (93%) were discharged from hematology care following a median of 25 days (range 0–2124 days).

These data suggest that pediatric patients with normocytic anemia possess a range of underlying etiologies, with iron deficiency being the most prevalent. This finding supports the initial management of normocytic anemia within the primary care setting, including an assessment of serum ferritin and iron panels.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia workup. This includes at least red blood cell (RBC) indices, such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in patients with low hemoglobin levels. A more extensive workup should include serum vitamin B12 measurement.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^112sZiqD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We propose an algorithm for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia based on the above recommendations.

- **Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia**: If anaemia is detected on a screening sample, evaluation is necessary, beginning with an assessment of iron status. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation levels, or both indicate absolute iron deficiency, referral to a gastroenterologist to rule out a gastrointestinal malignancy as a source of chronic blood loss may be indicated.

- **Addressing serum levels**: If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both rule out absolute iron deficiency, determining serum creatinine and GFR may indicate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and necessitate referral to a nephrologist.

- **Inconclusive serum values**: When serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both are inconclusive, further evaluation is needed to rule out absolute iron deficiency or inflammation/chronic disease. A therapeutic trial of iron would confirm absolute iron deficiency. No response to iron therapy would indicate anaemia of chronic disease, suggesting that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy be initiated.

These recommendations are intended to provide guidance for preoperative evaluation in the elective surgical patient. Limiting preadmission testing to a few days before the scheduled operative procedure precludes the opportunity to evaluate and manage the patient with unexplained anaemia. The recommended time frame of testing is four weeks.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies, including cancer, and thus GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We also recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA; however, other blood tests, such as transferrin saturation, can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115fQhob]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia in AIG, with or without PA, may present as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic is the classic association (Figure 3). Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, and the most common etiologies are iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Gastric acid is crucial for enzyme activation and the release of micronutrients from dietary sources. It is also important for the reduction and absorption of iron.

Vitamin B12 deficiency in AIG patients may be attributed to parietal cell loss and autoantibodies targeting intrinsic factor (IF). IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating its uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores deplete more quickly than vitamin B12 stores, making iron deficiency anemia an early manifestation of AIG. Although vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompt an AIG workup, it should be noted that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated.

The diagnosis of anemia may be complicated by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. A multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, showed that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia. Pernicious anemia was more common in males and older patients, while iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in patients with and without anemia. These findings mirrored those of another cohort study.

### Diagnostic workup of microcytic anemia: An evaluation of underuse or misuse of laboratory testing in a hospital setting using the AlinIQ system [^114hzc6K]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The underuse of laboratory testing has previously been investigated in preselected populations, such as documented malpractice claims. However, these numbers might not reflect real-life situations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the underuse and misuse of laboratory follow-up testing in a real-life hospital patient population with microcytic anemia, using laboratory results ordered during routine patient care.

From all patients in whom a microcytic anemia was detected during routine diagnostics in 2018, all available laboratory data were collected and screened for the appropriateness of the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency and thalassemia. Subgroup analysis was performed for patient groups with mean corpuscular volume values of 75 to 79 μm³ (group 1), 65 to 74 μm³ (group 2), and less than 65 μm³ (group 3).

A total of 2244 patients with microcytic anemia were identified. Follow-up testing for iron deficiency was not performed in 761 cases (34%). For inconclusive ferritin levels due to elevated C-reactive protein results (n = 336), reticulocyte hemoglobin content or soluble transferrin receptor levels were missing in 86 cases (26%). In patients with suspected thalassemia (n = 127), follow-up testing for hemoglobin variants was not performed in 70 cases (55%). Subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of underuse of iron status, as well as thalassemia/hemoglobinopathy testing, decreased from group 1 to group 3. When considering relevant preexisting anemia diagnoses, laboratory tests were underused in 904 cases (40.3%).

In conclusion, 40% (n = 904) of the patients experienced underuse of the necessary laboratory tests.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: A neglected essential diagnostic test [^114FxChk]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

To update guidelines with the new findings from the TRACT trial, a consensus severe anaemia management algorithm was developed. This algorithm aimed to improve evidence-based clinical practice and reduce the unnecessary use of transfusion in children with uncomplicated severe anaemia.

However, two vital components of the transfusion management algorithm included both clinical monitoring and haemoglobin (Hb) monitoring. Using data from the TRACT trial, we were able to show that a minimum of three additional measurements of Hb over 48 hours of hospital stay would identify approximately 50% of developing severe and complicated anaemia cases. This was demonstrated since 76% of children required a transfusion following a drop in Hb below 40 g/l.

From this watch and wait policy, there was no evidence of short- or long-term adverse events such as morbidity and mortality. The biggest concern raised at the meeting was that future evidence-based practice would require the provision of point-of-care (POC) Hb testing — something that most hospitals do not have.

### Shortcomings in infant iron deficiency screening methods [^112uZxpo]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Screening for iron deficiency anemia is a well-established practice in pediatrics, but numerous challenges surrounding recommendations raise questions about the effectiveness of this strategy.

- **Objective**: To evaluate iron deficiency anemia screening approaches by assessing rates of follow-up testing and resolution among patients meeting screening criteria in a primary care setting.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed. We extracted electronic medical record data on complete blood counts for infants who received primary care in our clinics in the past 10 years. We calculated rates of positive screening results with 9 different measurement criteria and determined rates of follow-up testing and documented correction of iron deficiency among those who screened positive.

- **Results**: Our cohort consisted of 4,984 children who were screened at 9 to 15 months of age, between 1994 and 2004. There was a wide distribution of positive detection rates (range: 1.5–14.5%) among the 9 screening criteria. Follow-up testing rates were low. No more than 25% of infants who screened positive by any criterion underwent a repeat complete blood count within 6 months. Moreover, no more than 11.6% (range: 4.4–11.6%) had documented correction of their laboratory abnormalities.

- **Conclusions**: Significant shortcomings exist in iron deficiency anemia screening practices. A widely agreed-upon, specific, and inexpensive screening criterion, with increased emphasis on systems-based approaches to iron deficiency screening, is needed.

### Anemia in infants and children: Evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also result from genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth.

- **Screening recommendations**: The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age.

- **Laboratory evaluation**: Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause.

- **Treatment in iron deficiency anemia**: A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain.

- **Classification of anemia**: Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate.

### Compliance with NCCN guidelines for evaluation and treatment of anemia among patients with solid tumors [^112giCKm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Low credibility.

The NCCN guidelines for hematopoietic growth factors recommend the evaluation and treatment of anemia in patients with cancer. However, there is a paucity of data regarding compliance with these recommendations.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients diagnosed with any solid tumor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2008 to 2017. Tumor registry-confirmed cancer cases were identified by ICD-O codes using the Synthetic Derivative database. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hgb) level ≤ 11 g/dL and graded according to CTCAE version 5.0. Absolute, functional, and possible functional iron deficiency were defined based on NCCN guidelines.

- **Results**: A total of 25,018 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 60 years. The most common malignancies were respiratory tract, prostate, and nonprostate urologic (11% each). Among 8,695 patients with Hgb levels available prior to diagnosis, 1,484 (17%) were noted to be anemic proximal to diagnosis. Of the 25,018 patients, 11,019 (44%) were anemic within 6 months of diagnosis. Of these patients, 4,686 (43%) had grade 2 (moderate) anemia and 9,623 (87%) had normocytic anemia. Patients with retroperitoneal/peritoneal cancers had the highest prevalence of anemia (83/110; 75%). A total of 4,125 (37%) underwent any evaluation of their anemia, of whom 1,742 (16%) had iron studies performed and 1,528 (14%) had vitamin B12 or folate studies performed. Fewer than half of the patients with anemia received treatment (n = 4,318; 39%), including blood transfusion (n = 3,528; 32%) and oral iron supplementation (n = 1,279; 12%).

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

In specific cases of iron deficiency anemia, especially concerning patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive anemia workup. This should include, at a minimum, red blood cell (RBC) indices such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration if hemoglobin levels are below normal.

For a more detailed investigation, the workup should also include: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, and haptoglobin; the percentage of hypochromic red cells; reticulocyte hemoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); soluble transferrin receptor levels; creatinine; and urea.

### Efficacy of advanced discriminating algorithms for screening on iron-deficiency anemia and β-thalassemia trait: A multicenter evaluation [^114cEFj6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

For many years, the application of RBC indices has been recommended for discriminating between subjects with iron deficiency and those with thalassemia. However, the application of the algorithms resulted in only 30% to 40% of subjects being appropriately classified. The aim of the study was to establish the efficacy of algorithms for anemia screening, including new hematologic parameters such as the percentage of hypochromic and microcytic RBCs and the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes. Subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) (n = 142) and subjects with β-thalassemia (n = 34) were enrolled in a European multicenter study. Apparently healthy subjects were used as a reference group (n = 309). Hemocytometric investigations were performed on a Sysmex XE5000 hematology analyzer. The algorithms for IDA discrimination yielded results for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0.88, 79%, 97%, 74%, and 98%, respectively. The algorithms for β-thalassemia discrimination revealed similar results (0.86, 74%, 98%, 75%, and 99%, respectively). We conclude that the advanced algorithms, derived from extended RBC parameters provided by the Sysmex XE5000 analyzer, are useful as laboratory anemia screening devices.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis.

These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as follows:

- **Defects of intestinal iron absorption**: These impact the body's ability to absorb iron effectively from the diet.
- **Disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle**: These impair erythroblast iron uptake, hindering the proper functioning of iron within red blood cells.
- **Defects of mitochondrial iron utilization**: These affect haem synthesis or iron sulphur cluster synthesis, critical to cell function.
- **Defects of iron recycling**: These impede the body's ability to reuse iron efficiently.

A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow for the distinction of the different types, which is a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Anemia [^113MLZqC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with anemia are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED); emergency physicians (EPs) often play an important role in the evaluation and management of anemia. Although many patients have findings consistent with anemia on routine laboratory tests, only a small percentage will require acute intervention. An understanding of the broader types of anemia and how to manage such patients is important in the practice of an EP, as the presence of anemia will impact treatment plans for a variety of other disorders. This article reviews the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the ED with anemia.
