## Question

Why would you check a tryptase level in a patient with anaphyaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we would check serum tryptase in a patient with anaphylaxis, and how to interpret and act on the results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale for tryptase as a marker of mast cell activation. Then, I should confirm that anaphylaxis remains a clinical diagnosis and clarify where tryptase adds value. Next, I will verify optimal timing for acute and baseline sampling. After that, I need to review validated interpretation algorithms and their performance, including pediatric nuances. I will then consider high-yield clinical scenarios where testing is most informative, assess hereditary α-tryptasemia screening thresholds, and examine prognostic implications. Finally, I should acknowledge limitations, integrate complementary biomarkers, and synthesize a practical clinical pathway, making sure I do not let testing delay epinephrine administration [^117PzXHn] [^115tH6v2].

> Let me first anchor the pathophysiology. Anaphylaxis is driven by rapid mast cell degranulation, and tryptase — stored in mast cell granules — is released into the circulation during these events, providing objective biochemical evidence of mast cell activation to support the clinical diagnosis; I need to ensure I differentiate chronic baseline protryptase from acutely released mature tryptase when I interpret results, because the former reflects mast cell burden and the latter reflects activation [^117PzXHn] [^112WvQaU] [^115tH6v2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — anaphylaxis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and I should not withhold epinephrine while waiting for labs; tryptase adds confirmatory, mechanistic value when the presentation is atypical or when I need to exclude mimics such as septic shock or severe asthma, and it aids documentation and subsequent work-up, but its negative predictive value is limited, especially in food-induced reactions where tryptase often remains normal, so a normal value does not exclude anaphylaxis [^115tH6v2] [^112yxZKv].

> I need to check optimal timing next. The acute sample should be obtained as early as feasible, ideally within 30 minutes to 2 hours of symptom onset; I initially thought the peak was consistently at 2 hours, but wait, peak levels are often around 1 hour with a roughly 2-hour half-life, so sampling in that window is key, and then a baseline sample should be drawn at least 24 hours after complete symptom resolution for comparison; results are most interpretable as paired acute and baseline values, and I should also remember that corticosteroids can modestly lower basal tryptase over time — my first thought was that they meaningfully suppress the acute rise, but let me correct that: the concern is more about baseline reduction rather than blunting the acute degranulation signal [^111VSBdQ] [^117PzXHn] [^115CjEAe] [^111idg5m].

> Now, interpretation — let me verify the algorithms. The widely used "20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline" rule supports significant mast cell activation, but it can misclassify patients with variable baselines; a data-driven refinement shows that an acute-to-baseline tryptase ratio exceeding 1.685 optimizes sensitivity and specificity in adults, with pediatric data suggesting an optimal ratio near 1.74, whereas an absolute acute threshold like 14 μg/L is less specific and not personalized; in perioperative cohorts, the consensus formula of acute > 1.2×baseline + 2 μg/L has shown good PPV and specificity, reinforcing the need for paired sampling [^113PznWu] [^117M9sgf] [^116ZE1Sn] [^115ajv3V].

> Next, I will examine when testing has the highest yield. I should prioritize tryptase in severe Hymenoptera sting anaphylaxis — especially with hypotension and minimal skin findings — because elevated baseline tryptase increases the likelihood of underlying mastocytosis; I should also obtain tryptase in unexplained or idiopathic anaphylaxis, in perioperative reactions where it can guide culprit evaluation and predict basophil activation test positivity, and in refractory or atypical reactions where mechanism is uncertain [^112x9GkK] [^1145dYLv] [^1178pNKy] [^115eXtAf].

> Let me consider hereditary α-tryptasemia carefully. Moderately elevated baseline tryptase often reflects HαT, and I should consider genetic testing when baseline tryptase is 8 ng/mL or higher, recognizing that a normal reference up to 15 ng/mL has been proposed to include healthy HαT carriers; importantly, HαT is enriched among patients with drug-induced anaphylaxis, particularly to antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies, and may modulate severity, so identifying HαT can refine risk counseling and management plans [^1157z6pq] [^116gXcHJ] [^112yYfkP] [^114xu1PT].

> I should review prognostic implications. Higher baseline tryptase correlates with a greater risk of severe systemic reactions to Hymenoptera stings, including shock or syncope, and baseline tryptase may also track with outcomes and safety considerations during venom immunotherapy; these relationships justify obtaining baseline tryptase for risk stratification in venom allergy evaluations [^113ZDQFd] [^117K4eeU] [^116ziH5F].

> But wait, I need to acknowledge limitations and caveats. Normal tryptase does not rule out anaphylaxis, with low negative predictive value in real-world settings and especially in food reactions; false positives can occur in myeloid neoplasms, renal failure, and post-mortem samples, and even bradykinin-mediated processes can variably affect mast cells; practically, turnaround is often delayed in emergency care, though samples remain stable when frozen for deferred analysis, which I should leverage in systems-level protocols [^112yxZKv] [^112WvQaU] [^115RDNxj] [^114mvifn].

> Next, I should review complementary biomarkers and adjunct tests. Platelet-activating factor correlates strongly with severity, surpassing tryptase and histamine in some cohorts, while urinary leukotriene E4 and prostaglandin D2 metabolites can increase alongside tryptase and may document mast cell activation when serum tryptase is normal; in perioperative settings, a significant tryptase rise strongly predicts basophil activation test positivity to the culprit, which can guide targeted testing strategies, though BAT performance is variable across drug classes and laboratories [^116r7MgN] [^116Cn7qp] [^115eXtAf] [^1176FzFS].

> I will now synthesize a clinical decision pathway. During the acute episode, if anaphylaxis is suspected, I should draw an acute tryptase as early as possible within 2 hours of onset, but I should never delay epinephrine for sampling; after stabilization, I should arrange a baseline tryptase at least 24 hours after full resolution; I will interpret paired results using the 1.685 ratio or 1.2×baseline + 2 formula, consider mastocytosis work-up when baseline exceeds about 20 ng/mL, and consider HαT testing when baseline is 8–15 ng/mL; if tryptase is normal but clinical suspicion remains high, I should treat as anaphylaxis and consider adjunct biomarkers and targeted allergy work-up, documenting findings for counseling, avoidance, and decisions such as venom immunotherapy referral when appropriate [^115tH6v2] [^117PzXHn] [^113PznWu] [^1178pNKy].

> In conclusion, checking serum tryptase in anaphylaxis provides objective confirmation of mast cell activation when timed and interpreted correctly, identifies occult clonal mast cell disease or HαT that influence risk, informs perioperative and venom allergy work-ups, and contributes to prognostic assessment; I need to ensure paired sampling, apply validated algorithms rather than absolute cutoffs alone, and integrate results with the clinical picture, especially given the test's limited sensitivity in food anaphylaxis and its practical turnaround constraints [^117PzXHn] [^113PznWu] [^112yxZKv] [^112x9GkK].

You check a tryptase level in anaphylaxis to confirm mast cell activation [^115tH6v2] and support the diagnosis when clinical features are ambiguous or absent (e.g. no urticaria) [^117PzXHn] [^112x9GkK]. Tryptase rises within 30–120 minutes and peaks around 1–2 hours [^115CjEAe], so timing is critical [^117PzXHn]. A significant acute rise (≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline) [^113PznWu] indicates mast cell degranulation and helps distinguish anaphylaxis from mimics. Baseline tryptase should be measured after recovery [^112x9GkK] to assess for mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^1157z6pq], which increase anaphylaxis risk [^117K4eeU]. Tryptase is not always elevated, especially in food-induced reactions [^115jH974], so normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis [^112yxZKv] [^115RDNxj].

---

## Clinical rationale for measuring tryptase in anaphylaxis

### Confirmation of mast cell activation

Mast cell degranulation releases **tryptase** [^115tH6v2], a hallmark of anaphylaxis [^116KjffG]. Elevated tryptase provides **diagnostic support** [^117PzXHn], particularly when clinical features are ambiguous or absent (e.g. no urticaria) [^112x9GkK].

---

### Differentiation from other conditions

Tryptase aids the **differential diagnosis**, helping distinguish anaphylaxis from conditions with similar presentations (e.g. vasovagal syncope, panic attacks, acute asthma) [^116KjffG]. Its **specificity** for mast cell activation exceeds that of histamine, which can be elevated in various conditions [^116r7MgN] [^112yxZKv].

---

### Identification of underlying mast cell disorders

An elevated **baseline tryptase** (> 8 ng/mL) [^112yYfkP] suggests mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^1157z6pq] and increases anaphylaxis risk [^117K4eeU] [^113ZDQFd]. Identifying these disorders improves **risk assessment**, guiding management and stratification [^112x9GkK].

---

## Timing and interpretation of tryptase measurements

### Timing of tryptase sampling

The **acute phase** sample should be obtained within 30 minutes to 2 hours after symptom onset [^117PzXHn]; levels peak at 1–2 hours [^115CjEAe] and return to baseline within 12–24 hours [^115tH6v2]. The **baseline measurement** should be drawn at least 24 hours after complete symptom resolution to establish baseline [^111VSBdQ].

---

### Interpretation of tryptase levels

A **significant rise** — an acute increase of ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline — indicates mast cell activation [^113PznWu]. A **normal baseline** is typically 1–15 ng/mL; an elevated baseline suggests underlying mast cell disorders [^112yYfkP].

---

## Clinical scenarios where tryptase measurement is particularly useful

- **Perioperative anaphylaxis**: Helps confirm diagnosis and guide future anesthesia management [^111VSBdQ] [^115ajv3V].

- **Idiopathic anaphylaxis**: Supports diagnosis when the trigger is unknown [^112x9GkK] [^112KNRkU].

- **Severe reactions**: Useful in severe reactions with hypotension or cardiovascular collapse [^116KjffG] [^112x9GkK].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False negatives**: Tryptase may be normal in food-induced anaphylaxis or mild reactions [^115jH974] [^112yxZKv].

- **False positives**: Elevated baseline tryptase can occur in mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^112WvQaU] [^112x9GkK].

- **Clinical correlation**: Always interpret tryptase in clinical context; normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis [^116r7MgN] [^112yxZKv].

---

## Summary: clinical utility of tryptase measurement in anaphylaxis

Serum tryptase measurement **supports anaphylaxis diagnosis** [^117PzXHn] by confirming mast cell activation, distinguishing anaphylaxis from mimics, and identifying underlying mast cell disorders such as mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^1157z6pq]. Sampling should include an acute specimen obtained 30 minutes to 2 hours after onset [^117PzXHn] and a baseline specimen drawn at least 24 hours after complete resolution, with interpretation using the ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL rule [^113PznWu]. Because false negatives and positives occur, results must be interpreted in clinical context [^112yxZKv]. In short, measuring tryptase in anaphylaxis **confirms mast cell activation**, supports diagnosis, and identifies underlying mast cell disorders; **timing and interpretation are critical**, and results should be correlated with clinical findings.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hymenoptera sting allergy, specifically concerning serum tryptase levels, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a baseline serum tryptase measurement in patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis. This is particularly pertinent in cases involving hypotension and/or the absence of urticaria, unexplained anaphylaxis, or suspected mastocytosis. However, clinicians should not rely solely on serum tryptase levels for the diagnostic assessment of the likelihood of a clonal mast cell disorder.

### Global trends in anaphylaxis epidemiology and clinical implications [^112yxZKv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Although largely a clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and specifically serum tryptase, may support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis and aid in differentiating anaphylaxis from its mimics, such as idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome and severe asthma, although serum tryptase level is also elevated in fatal asthma. This can be important in the context of monitoring trends for more severe reactions. Yet, despite its recommendation in guidelines, the role of tryptase in "real-world" practice remains debated.

From a practical standpoint, serum tryptase is not readily available to emergency providers because it often takes several days for results to become available. Moreover, although the positive predictive value of serum tryptase is high (93%), the negative predictive value is low (17%) and may not be helpful, particularly for food-induced anaphylaxis when the tryptase level is frequently not elevated. Other biomarkers, such as platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, and chemokine ligand-2, have been proposed but can be difficult to measure even under laboratory conditions. Future studies may need to consider examining the sensitivity and specificity of a combination of biomarkers.

With regard to anaphylaxis management, although epinephrine remains the first-line treatment, glucocorticoids and antihistamines, including both H1- and H2-antihistamines, are often recommended as second-line treatment.

### Defining baseline variability of serum tryptase levels improves accuracy in identifying anaphylaxis [^113PznWu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Acute increases of ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL (20 + 2 rule) over basal serum tryptase (BST) is the recommended threshold supporting a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Prospective studies have demonstrated high sensitivity for this algorithm after parenteral exposure, but specificity has not been evaluated.

- **Objective**: We sought to define a serum tryptase change that distinguishes baseline variability from anaphylaxis on the basis of intraindividual variation in BST.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three total subjects with atopy (n = 62) or hereditary α-tryptasemia (HαT) (n = 31) and ≥ 2 BST measurements were identified. Sequential BST variability measurements were modeled and threshold ratios that optimized sensitivity and/or specificity were determined. Models were tested in 22 individuals with physician-diagnosed anaphylaxis and validated in independent cohorts of individuals with HαT (n = 33), indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) (n = 52), and ISM + HαT (n = 12). Mature tryptase levels were measured in HαT (n = 19) and ISM (n = 20). An online application was developed for clinical use.

- **Results**: As a result of BST variability, 9.7% (9/93) of primary cohort patients, 18% (6/33) of HαT, 30% (16/52) of ISM, and 25% (3/12) of ISM + HαT patients from the validation cohorts met the 20 + 2 rule despite absent immediate hypersensitivity symptoms; mature tryptase was noncontributory among individuals with HαT or ISM at baseline. A ratio of acute tryptase/BST exceeding 1.685 provided the optimized diagnostic rule for jointly maximizing sensitivity and specificity. Statistically significant improvement was observed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anaphylaxis, specifically with respect to serum tryptase, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining acute-phase tryptase level measurement as early as possible during a suspected anaphylactic event, ideally within 2 hours after the onset of symptoms. Consider obtaining a second tryptase measurement later as a baseline for comparison to determine whether there was a significant acute elevation.

### Inherited and acquired determinants of serum tryptase levels in humans [^112WvQaU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To aid the clinician in correctly interpreting serum tryptase levels.

- **Data sources**: Primary peer-reviewed literature.

- **Study selections**: Clinical and basic science peer-reviewed studies characterizing the genetic and physiological bases for tryptase generation, secretion, and elevation, including those describing serum tryptase levels in population-based cohort studies.

- **Results**: Clinically measured basal serum tryptase (BST) consists of ostensibly inactive alpha- and beta-tryptase precursors. The autosomal dominant genetic trait hereditary alpha-tryptasemia is the most common cause for elevated BST levels, with other acquired causes, such as renal failure and clonal myeloid diseases, being far less common. Acute increases in serum tryptase levels resulting from the release of mature tryptase from secretory granules are specific to mast cell degranulation, but are not detected in all cases of systemic anaphylaxis.

- **Conclusion**: Understanding the differences and distinguishing between acute increases in serum tryptase and chronic elevations in BST owing to inherited or acquired conditions is critical in the correct interpretation of this useful clinical biomarker.

### Anaphylaxis in outpatients: A 5-year retrospective study on incidence and clinical characteristics at a university hospital in Wuhan, China [^11657ok8]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

This study's limitations include potential recall bias and variability in medical record documentation. Besides, serum tryptase detection kits have not yet received marketing approval in China, which precludes the possibility of using serum tryptase to further verify the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in patients initially identified by our physicians. Also, unmeasured confounding factors cannot be eliminated, such as the population consisting of patients seeking medical treatment. It is noteworthy that, while the DPAP system is restricted to internal hospital use and is not transferable, the extensive data set of 75 million medical records from over 16 million patients mitigates some biases.

### Cutaneous manifestations in Hymenoptera and Diptera anaphylaxis: Relationship with basal serum tryptase [^115Ds6cK]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the clinical presentation of systemic anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera and Diptera with regard to basal serum tryptase (BT) and to evaluate mastocytosis in patients with elevated tryptase.

The medical records of 140 patients with a history of systemic reaction to venom were retrospectively reviewed. Symptoms and severity of anaphylaxis and BT were recorded. Most patients with elevated tryptase were screened for mastocytosis: a dermatological examination with a skin biopsy was performed in 19 cases and a bone marrow biopsy in 14 cases.

- **Results**: Tryptase was elevated in 23 patients. These patients reported fewer usual skin reactions, with urticaria in 26.1% of cases with raised tryptase compared to 76.1% of cases with normal tryptase. They experienced more flushing (52.2% vs. 4.3%) and frequently did not present skin reactions (26.1% vs. 9.4%). They also presented a more severe reaction, with a mean grade of severity of 3.48 compared to 2.69. Mastocytosis was diagnosed in seven patients with elevated tryptase: indolent systemic mastocytosis in six cases and cutaneous mastocytosis without systemic involvement in one case. In five cases, mastocytosis was previously undiagnosed. Lesions of cutaneous mastocytosis, diagnosed in five patients, consisted of urticaria pigmentosa in all cases and were often inconspicuous.

- **Conclusion**: These results demonstrate particular clinical features of the allergic reaction in patients with elevated BT and the higher frequency of mastocytosis in this population. In patients with a severe anaphylactic reaction without urticaria, but with flushing, tryptase levels play an important diagnostic role.

### Constitutively raised serum concentrations of mast-cell tryptase and severe anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera stings [^117K4eeU]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Anaphylactic IgE-mediated reactions to Hymenoptera stings vary in their severity for reasons that are not clear. We investigated patients with a history of systemic anaphylactic reactions to honeybee or wasp stings. Nine (75%) of 12 patients with raised tryptase concentrations, but only 28 (28%) of 102 patients with lower tryptase concentrations, had a history of severe sting reactions (p = 0.004). Raised baseline serum concentrations of mast-cell tryptase and mastocytosis are potential risk factors for severe allergic reactions to Hymenoptera venom.

### Systemic reactions and anaphylaxis with an acute serum tryptase ≥ 14 μg/L: Retrospective characterisation of aetiology, severity and adherence to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for serial tryptase measurements and specialist referral [^116ZE1Sn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to characterise patients with systemic reactions and anaphylaxis with an acute serum tryptase of ≥ 14 μg/L against recently published World Allergy Organisation (WAO) diagnostic criteria. A clinical audit was also performed to assess adherence to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommendations regarding serial tryptase measurements and specialist referral.

A systematic retrospective survey was carried out between 2006 and 2010, involving 171 patients (86 males, mean age ± SD: 48 ± 20 years). Data were extracted from emergency department and specialist allergy clinic records.

The results showed that 34 patients (20%) had a grade 1 reaction, 61 (36%) grade 2, 46 (27%) grade 3, and 6 patients (4%) grade 4. Notably, 24 patients (13%) could not be graded due to a lack of adequate clinical details and 6% developed a biphasic response. Serial tryptase measurements were not available for 117 (69%) of the cohort. Of the patients, 97 (57%) were referred for specialist assessment, and 72 (74%) attended. Diagnoses included idiopathic systemic reactions/anaphylaxis in 50% of cases; 28% were triggered by drugs, 14% by foods, and 8% by other allergies including disorders of mast cell overload. A weak positive correlation was detected between acute serum tryptase and severity.

In conclusion, the correlation between acute serum tryptase and the severity of anaphylaxis/systemic reactions is weak. A significant proportion of patients with raised acute serum tryptase had mild reactions, which did not meet WAO criteria for anaphylaxis. This may reduce the specificity of the test. The commonest etiology in the cases studied was idiopathic.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^115eXtAf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. The performance of BAT is dependent on multiple factors, including individual laboratory variations, basophil counts, patient comorbidities, and specific culprits, which were not studied. It should be noted that BAT has varying sensitivity and specificity for different causes of PA, with fairly satisfactory performance against, for instance, neuromuscular-blocking agents and chlorhexidine, but not β-lactam antibiotics. We did not specifically look into potential differences in CD63 and CD203c expression. The exact timing of tryptase sampling (within the 4-hour window) was not available either. Furthermore, not all identified culprits were confirmed by drug provocation tests. Despite the fact that all included patients had an exact culprit identified by multiple diagnostic modalities, which were concordant with a clinical diagnosis made by an allergist, there remains a possibility of false-positive results. Prospective and multicenter studies will be required to overcome these limitations and evaluate this novel utility of tryptase results. Regardless, we believe that our findings are of empirical value and could help inform clinicians planning their investigations in real-life practice.

In conclusion, we observed that tryptase elevation is a very sensitive predictor of BAT positivity among patients with identified culprits of PA. Given the additional utility of tryptase levels in predicting BAT positivity, we strongly reinforce the importance of measuring acute tryptase in all instances of suspected PA.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^112yYfkP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

This proposal includes a genetically determined normal upper tryptase limit of 8 ng/mL, below which the likelihood of hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HαT) is rather low. The clinically relevant cut-off for tryptase is higher (15 ng/mL) to include healthy individuals with HαT and all other controls, whereas in most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), tryptase levels are higher (> 15 ng/mL).

- **Causes of elevated levels of baseline serum tryptase (BST)**: A number of different conditions may be associated with a higher (or lower) BST level. The most prevalent underlying etiology is HαT, an autosomal dominant genetic trait defined by an increased number of TPSAB1 gene copies encoding alpha tryptase. Hereditary alpha tryptasemia is detected in about 4% to 7.5% of the population in the Western world. Most individuals with HαT present with a slightly to moderately elevated BST level (15–30 ng/mL). It has also been demonstrated that the serum tryptase levels correlate with the total copy numbers of the TPSAB1 gene in these cases. However, HαT-positive persons may also present with a lower tryptase level (≤ 8 ng/mL) or a rather high tryptase level (up to and rarely over 150 ng/mL). Those with very high tryptase exhibit multiple TPSAB1 replications.

Clinically, most individuals with HαT do not have symptoms that had previously been associated with this trait. However, HαT has also been reported in patients who have experienced severe anaphylactic reactions, especially when concomitant allergies and/or clonal mast cell (MC) diseases are present. Conversely, the occurrence of severe symptoms in individual cases may indicate…

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^117BD3Hi]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is the most acute and life-threatening manifestation of allergic disorders. Currently, there is a need to improve its medical management and increase the understanding of its molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to quantify the extravasation underlying human anaphylactic reactions and propose new theragnostic approaches.

- **Methods**: Molecular determinations were performed in paired serum samples obtained during the acute phase and at baseline from patients presenting with hypersensitivity reactions. These were classified according to their severity as Grades 1, 2, and 3, the latter two being considered anaphylaxis. Tryptase levels were measured by ImmunoCAP, and serum protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay. Human serum albumin (HSA) and hemoglobin beta subunit (HBB) levels were determined by Western blot and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients were included in the study, 112 of whom had experienced anaphylaxis (83 and 29 with Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Tryptase diagnostic efficiency substantially improved when considering patients' baseline values (33%-54%) instead of the acute value threshold (21%). Serum protein concentration and HSA significantly decreased in anaphylaxis (p < 0.0001). HSA levels dropped with the severity of the reaction (6% and 15% for Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Furthermore, HBB levels increased during the acute phase of all hypersensitivity reactions (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: For the first time, the extravasation underlying human anaphylaxis has been quantified and proposed as a target for new theragnostic approaches.

### Distinct plasma biomarkers confirm the diagnosis of mastocytosis and identify increased risk of anaphylaxis [^1132d9vF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in the skin and/or internal organs. Patients typically present with a broad variety of mediator-related clinical symptoms, including severe anaphylaxis. However, not all patients with mastocytosis experience anaphylactic reactions.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify disease-specific biomarkers in plasma that could be used to predict patients with mastocytosis with an increased risk of anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: Nineteen patients (≥ 18 years) and two control groups (11 subjects with allergic asthma and 13 healthy volunteers without a history of atopy) were recruited. In total, 248 plasma proteins were analyzed by proximity extension assay using Olink Proseek Multiplex panels.

- **Results**: We identified four novel proteins, in addition to tryptase, E-selectin, adrenomedullin, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1, and CUB domain-containing protein 1/CD138 to be significantly increased in patients with mastocytosis compared with both patients with asthma and healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated whether we could discriminate between patients with mastocytosis with or without anaphylaxis. In addition to tryptase, we identified three novel proteins, namely allergin-1, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and galectin-3, with significantly different levels in patients with mastocytosis with anaphylaxis compared with those without anaphylaxis.

- **Conclusions**: Newly identified proteomic biomarkers may be used to predict patients with mastocytosis with increased risk of anaphylaxis.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^11196xeP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, there has been a debate about the stability and intradonor variability of baseline serum tryptase (BST) levels. Indeed, in some studies, the intrapatient variability of tryptase was found to be substantial. In other studies, basal tryptase levels were found to be rather consistent over time in individual adults (Figure 3). The same has been described for children, although some variability in tryptase levels was found.

Overall, the currently used serum tryptase test (fluoroimmune-enzyme assay) is robust, and the variation seen in the test results in individual donors (when tested over time) is usually not relevant clinically, provided that the conditions are stable and preanalytical issues are avoided. Table II provides recommendations for preanalytical measures and issues to address in the evaluation of the BST level in healthy donors and patients with mast cell (MC) neoplasms. When these preanalytical aspects and issues are taken into account, basal tryptase levels should be rather stable over time, provided that the overall situation and conditions remain stable.

### Elevated serum concentrations of beta-tryptase, but not alpha-tryptase, in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). An investigation of anaphylactic mechanisms [^116pUmdq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death, remains the most common category of post-perinatal death in the UK. By definition, the cause of death is unknown, but a long-standing theory suggests that some of these deaths could be the result of anaphylaxis.

- **Objective**: To investigate the potential contribution of anaphylactic mechanisms to deaths in infancy by determining relative levels of alpha- and beta-tryptases, as well as both total and allergen-specific IgE in sera from groups of infants whose deaths were attributed to SIDS or to other causes.

- **Methods**: Serum samples were collected at the time of post-mortem examination from infants whose death was classified as SIDS (n = 40) and from a comparison group where the cause of death had been established (n = 32). Serum tryptase concentrations were measured using a radioimmunoassay with monoclonal antibody G5, which primarily detects beta-tryptase, or an ELISA with antibody AA5, which has equal sensitivity for both alpha- and beta-tryptases. Levels of total IgE and IgE specific for casein, beta-lactoglobulin, house dust mite, and moulds were determined.

- **Results**: Analysis of the results from the two assays for tryptase indicated that levels of beta-like tryptase, the form secreted during anaphylactic degranulation, were significantly higher in serum from infants with SIDS compared to those whose death was explained. There was no evidence for an increase in serum levels of alpha-tryptase, the variant secreted constitutively from mast cells. Total levels of serum IgE did not differ between the two groups, reflecting the low circul…

### Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase: A biomarker in Hymenoptera venom allergy [^114ZRSQW]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a rapid, potentially fatal, immediate hypersensitivity reaction. During the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, preformed and newly formed biochemical mediators — including histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) — are released systematically. PAF is a proinflammatory phospholipid synthesized and secreted by mast cells, monocytes, and fixed tissue macrophages. Its binding to receptors on target cells such as platelets, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils results in many of the manifestations of acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Circulating levels of PAF are controlled by the activity of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that degrades PAF. Due to the quick elimination of PAF, with a half-life of 3–13 minutes, PAF-AH has been proposed as a surrogate biomarker for PAF activity correlated with the severity of anaphylaxis. However, PAF-AH has been investigated in Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) in only one previous study, involving a real-world population.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the role of PAF-AH as a predictive biomarker for the severity of reaction in a HVA-selected population (HVA-alone population) without confounding factors, and to compare their PAF-AH values with those of healthy subjects and patients with allergic asthma or rhinitis. We also investigated the correlation of PAF-AH activity with other factors — demographic factors, concomitant diseases and medications, serum tryptase values, venom sIgE levels, and the culprit insect — in a larger HVA re…

### An increase in serum tryptase even below 11.4 ng/mL may indicate a mast cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction: A prospective study in Hymenoptera venom allergic patients [^1134MTrD]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

During a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (SR), an increase in serum tryptase compared to the baseline value is an indicator of mast cell activation, most often due to an IgE-mediated mechanism.

- **Objective**: To study the relevance of an increase in serum tryptase below the upper normal value of 11.4 ng/mL.

- **Methods**: Serum tryptase levels were measured in 35 patients with Hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity before and during venom exposure. Of these, 20 developed SR to stings or following venom injections during immunotherapy (reactors), while 15 tolerated reexposure to stings or venom injections during immunotherapy without SR (non-reactors). Serum tryptase was estimated at 2, 5, and 24 hours after exposure and was compared to a baseline value obtained before or at least 72 hours after exposure.

- **Results**: Considering circadian variation of serum tryptase, a relative increase to ≥ 135% of the baseline value (relative delta bound) was defined to indicate mast cell activation. Such an increase was observed in 17 of 20 reactors (85%) but in none of the 15 non-reactors. A serum tryptase of ≥ 11.4 ng/mL following venom exposure was observed in eight of the 20 reactors (40%) and two (13.3%) of the 15 non-reactors. Both these non-reactors also had an elevated baseline serum tryptase.

- **Conclusions and clinical relevance**: Serum tryptase values obtained during a suspected hypersensitivity reaction must always be compared to a baseline value. A relative tryptase increase to ≥ 135% of the baseline value during a suspected hypersensitivity reaction indicates mast cell activation even below 11.4 ng/mL.

### Paired acute-baseline serum tryptase levels in perioperative anaphylaxis: An observational study [^115ajv3V]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is recognized mainly through clinical criteria, which may lack specificity or relevance in the perioperative setting. The transient increase in serum tryptase has been proposed since 1989 as a diagnostic tool. Sampling for well-defined acute and baseline determinations has been recommended. We assessed the performance of four proposed algorithms with tightly controlled time frames for tryptase sampling, their robustness with inadequate sampling times, and the possible use of mature tryptase determination.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on 102 adult patients from the Aix-Marseille University Hospitals who had experienced a perioperative hypersensitivity reaction clinically suggesting anaphylaxis. EAACI and ICON criteria were used to diagnose anaphylaxis. Mature and total serum tryptase levels were measured.

- **Results**: Based on EAACI guidelines, clinical diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis were found in 76 patients and lacking in 26. The most effective algorithm was the international consensus recommendation of 2012 that acute total tryptase levels should be greater than ([1.2×baseline tryptase] + 2) μg/L to be considered a clinically significant rise. In our cohort, this algorithm achieved 94% positive predictive value (PPV), 53% negative predictive value (NPV), 75% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and a Youden's index value of 0.61. A detectable acute mature tryptase level showed lower sensitivity, particularly in patients with acute total tryptase levels lower than 16 μg/L. Acute tryptase levels varied as a function of the clinical severity.

### Elevated basal serum tryptase and hymenoptera venom allergy: Relation to severity of sting reactions and to safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy [^113jMnWn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis and/or elevated basal serum tryptase may be associated with severe anaphylaxis. This study aims to analyze Hymenoptera venom-allergic patients concerning basal tryptase and its relation to the severity of sting reactions, as well as the safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy.

Basal serum tryptase was measured in 259 Hymenoptera venom-allergic patients, consisting of 158 honey bee and 101 Vespula patients. In 161 of these patients (104 honey bee, 57 Vespula), a sting challenge was performed during venom immunotherapy.

Nineteen of the 259 patients had an elevated basal serum tryptase. Evidence of cutaneous mastocytosis, as documented by skin biopsy, was present in 3 of 16 patients (18.8%). There was a clear correlation between basal serum tryptase and the grade of the initial allergic reaction (P < 0.0005). Of the 161 sting-challenged patients, 41 reacted to the challenge; 34 reacted to a bee sting, and 7 to a Vespula sting. Among these, 10 had an elevated basal serum tryptase, including 1 (2.9%) of the reacting and 2 (2.9%) of the non-reacting bee venom allergic individuals, compared to 3 (42.9%) of the reacting and 4 (8%) of the non-reacting Vespula venom allergic patients. This indicates a significant association between a reaction to the sting challenge and elevated basal serum tryptase in Vespula (chi2 = 6.926, P < 0.01), but not in BV-allergic patients.

Systemic allergic side effects to venom immunotherapy were observed in 13.9% of patients with normal and in 10% of those with elevated basal serum tryptase.

An elevated basal serum tryptase and mastocytosis are important factors in the context of venom allergy and its treatment.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^111G2ezf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an immediate and potentially life-threatening systemic reaction, most often due to mast cell (MC) degranulation, that represents a clinical and diagnostic challenge. International guidelines endorse the use of serum tryptase determination to confirm MC degranulation, thus supporting the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. However, most studies supporting this recommendation have been conducted in adults. The literature suggests that the diagnosis of pediatric anaphylaxis, which is more challenging than in adults, might be confirmed by tryptase determination.

A 2012 international consensus proposal enshrined the adequate sampling times of serum acute tryptase (sAT) and serum baseline tryptase (sBT). It established the Consensus formula (CCF) that sAT values exceeding a personalized cutoff calculated as [(1.2 × sBT) + 2] confirm systemic MC activation (MCA) and degranulation. These findings were further confirmed in 2019.

Data on tryptase performance for the diagnosis of pediatric anaphylaxis are scarce. A previous study including 41 children with sAT and sBT admitted to the emergency department (ED) found a 60.3% diagnostic sensitivity for the CCF, and up to 85.7% in severe reactions. In food-induced anaphylaxis in 49 children, serum tryptase determinations displayed 65.3% sensitivity.

These studies applied the CCF to small pediatric cohorts and found moderate performance. We took advantage of a 10-year database on tryptase sampling at the pediatric ED of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France, to describe a large pediatric cohort of anaphylaxis.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^1178pNKy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for mastocytosis, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering an evaluation for mastocytosis. This includes a bone marrow biopsy in adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or idiopathic anaphylaxis, particularly when there is a predictive REMA score.

### Acute/baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^116Cn7qp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

- **Key messages**: Episodes of anaphylaxis have an acute/baseline rise in the serum tryptase level greater than 1.685; however, the accompanying increases in levels of 3 urinary MC mediator metabolites are only sparsely reported in these cases.

- **Acute/baseline ratios**: The acute/baseline ratios of the urinary metabolite of LTC 4 (LTE 4) can exceed metabolites of both histamine and PGD 2, as well as that of serum tryptase during anaphylaxis.

- **Urinary excretion measurement**: In addition to measuring urinary excretion of both histamine and PGD 2 metabolites, documentation of acute/baseline urinary levels of LTE 4 is warranted in patients with anaphylaxis and can contribute to therapeutic options for these patients.

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^1167m2c3]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is the most acute and life-threatening manifestation of allergic disorders; currently, there is a need to improve its medical management and increase the understanding of its molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to quantify the extravasation underlying human anaphylactic reactions and propose new theragnostic approaches.

- **Methods**: Molecular determinations were performed in paired serum samples obtained during the acute phase and at baseline from patients presenting with hypersensitivity reactions. These reactions were classified according to severity as Grades 1, 2, and 3, with the latter two being considered anaphylaxis. Tryptase levels were measured by ImmunoCAP, and serum protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay. Human serum albumin (HSA) and hemoglobin beta subunit (HBB) levels were determined by Western blot and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients were included in the study. Among these, 112 had experienced anaphylaxis (83 and 29 with Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Tryptase diagnostic efficiency substantially improved when considering patients' baseline values (33%–54%) instead of the acute value threshold (21%). Serum protein concentration and HSA significantly decreased in anaphylaxis (p < 0.0001). HSA levels dropped with the severity of the reaction (6% and 15% for Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Furthermore, HBB levels increased during the acute phase of all hypersensitivity reactions (p < 0.0001).

For the first time, the extravasation underlying human anaphylaxis has been quantified, offering new insights into potential theragnostic approaches.

### Serum concentration of baseline mast cell tryptase: Evidence for a decline during long-term immunotherapy for Hymenoptera venom allergy [^116ziH5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Baseline serum mast cell tryptase concentration (BTC) is thought to reflect the constitutive mast cell load or activity of an individual patient. Little is known about the individual stability of BTC during long-term venom immunotherapy (VIT).

- **Objective**: To investigate the intra-individual stability of BTC over time in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy.

- **Methods**: Three hundred and two patients were studied. BTC was measured before and at least twice during VIT. At least 4 weeks lay between BTC measurements and the most recent field sting, in-hospital sting, or preceding venom injection. Multifactorial mixed linear models were used to analyze BTC changes over time.

- **Results**: Median observation time was 4.2 years (range 2–12 years). Before VIT, the median BTC was 6.8 microg/L (range 1.14–177 microg/L). The median coefficient of variation (CV) over time was 15.3% (range 1.9–63.8%). The median CV was significantly smaller in patients presenting with an elevated BTC (> 11.4 microg/L) than in patients with a normal BTC (11.4%, range 2.6–39.5%; vs. 17.6%, range 1.9–63.8%; P < 0.001). During VIT and after adjusting for age and gender, a slight but significant decrease of BTC over time was observed, at 2.5% per year (95% confidence interval 2.0–3.0%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Individual variation of BTC during VIT does not rise when BTC is increased before therapy. VIT is associated with a small, but continuous decrease of BTC over time, possibly indicating a dampened mast cell function or a decline in mast cell burden.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^1132WsuJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

There is an ongoing debate about the normal range, especially the upper normal limit, of basal serum (total) tryptase measured in healthy individuals. In all recent studies, total tryptase values were measured by the same fluoroimmune-enzyme assay. It is generally accepted that the lower limit of detection in this assay is about 1 ng/mL. Some individuals have even lower or undetectable tryptase levels, which are not clinically relevant.

In an initial unpublished study by the provider, the range of baseline serum tryptase measured in 126 healthy individuals was 1.0 to 11.4 ng/mL (ImmunoCAP Tryptase Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay. Directions for Use 52–5679-US/03, October 2019, Phadia AB). The upper limit of 11.4 ng/mL was determined by calculating the 95th percentile (95% confidence interval) of tryptase, indicating that only a few donors had tryptase levels beyond 12 ng/mL. This is remarkable and may be explained by the fact that (1) only a few cases with HαT were included and/or (2) most donors with HαT included had a tryptase level below 11.4 ng/mL.

In subsequent studies, the upper limit of normal tryptase was reported to be 8.23 ng/mL, 14 ng/mL, or 15 ng/mL. The different cut-off levels in these studies may be explained by different statistical approaches, by random variations in the fractions of HαT-positive individuals in these control cohorts, by age or ethnic factors, and/or by the fact that asymptomatic donors with a known allergy were either excluded or included in these analyses.

### Beta tryptase levels are not elevated in patients undergoing liver transplantation [^1164SWxr]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Reperfusion syndrome during liver transplantation and anaphylaxis are clinical syndromes that share similarities in physiological responses. The liver and intestine contain a variety of immunologically active cells, including mast cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility that mast-cell degranulation occurs routinely during transplantation and thereby contributes to hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy. Beta tryptase, an enzyme released by mast cells during degranulation, is a reliable marker for mast-cell-mediated events. Six patients undergoing liver transplantation had beta tryptase levels assayed in blood immediately before and after reperfusion of the liver. No patient showed an increase in beta tryptase levels at 15 or 60 minutes after reperfusion. In conclusion, it is unlikely that clinically significant mast-cell degranulation occurs routinely in patients undergoing liver transplantation.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^117M9sgf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

Dynamic measurement of serum acute (sAT) and baseline (sBT) tryptase confirms mast cell degranulation during systemic hypersensitivity reactions, provided timing and interpretation are appropriate. The consensus formula requires sAT greater than a personalized cutoff value [sAT > (1.2 × sBT) + 2]. Only a few studies have investigated its diagnostic performance in children.

- **Objective**: We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the consensus formula and alternative algorithms for interpreting tryptase levels in pediatric patients with suspected anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: Medical records of suspected anaphylaxis referred to the pediatric emergency department of the University Hospitals of Marseille (France) from 2011 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data, including total tryptase and allergy evaluations, were collected. Anaphylaxis was defined as a sudden-onset, perceived life-threatening systemic reaction at the time of physician assessment. Inclusion criteria were suspected anaphylaxis and at least one tryptase determination. The diagnostic performance of the consensus formula was compared to five alternative tryptase interpretation algorithms.

- **Results**: Among 315 patients (median age, 7.8 years; 317 emergency department visits), 175 (55%) were categorized as cases. Food-induced anaphylaxis was diagnosed in 82%, and 92 (52.6%) had two or more tryptase determinations. The highest diagnostic performance was achieved by the sAT/sBT ratio. A cutoff for the sAT/sBT ratio of > 1.74 yielded 66.7% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity.

### Tryptase genetics and anaphylaxis [^115RDNxj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Tryptases secreted by tissue mast cells and basophils can enter the bloodstream. In humans, tryptases are encoded by several genes and alleles, including alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Common variations include the complete absence of alpha genes. Until recently, alpha tryptase was considered the major tryptase secreted at baseline and in mastocytosis. However, the lack of alpha tryptase genes has little effect on circulating tryptase levels. These levels are now thought mainly to consist of inactive pro-beta tryptase that is secreted constitutively rather than stored in granules with mature tryptases. Pro-beta tryptase levels might thus reflect total body mast cell content. In contrast, mature beta tryptase can increase transiently in severe systemic anaphylaxis and confirm the diagnosis. However, it might fail to increase in food anaphylaxis or might increase nonspecifically in samples acquired after death. Thus, pro- and mature beta tryptase measurements are useful but associated with false-negative and false-positive results, which need to be considered when drawing clinical conclusions in cases of suspected anaphylaxis.

### Use and interpretation of acute and baseline tryptase in perioperative hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis [^111VSBdQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Paired acute and baseline serum or plasma tryptase sampling and determination have recently been included as a mechanistic approach in the diagnostic and management guidelines of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. The timing of this paired sampling is clearly defined in international consensus statements, with the optimal window for acute tryptase sampling between 30 minutes and 2 hours after the initiation of symptoms, whereas baseline tryptase should be measured in a sample collected before the event (pre-operation) or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. A transient elevation of the acute tryptase level greater than [2 + (1.2 × baseline tryptase level)] supports the involvement and activation of mast cells.

Here, we provide the clinical, pathophysiological, and technical rationale for the procedure and interpretation of paired acute and baseline tryptase. Clinical examples include up-to-date knowledge of hereditary α-tryptasemia as a frequent cause of baseline tryptase of 7 μg/L and higher, mastocytosis, other clonal myeloid disorders, cardiovascular or renal failure, and technical improvements resulting in continued lowering of the 95th percentile value. Clues for improved management of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis include:

- **Sustained dissemination and implementation of updated guidelines**: Preoperative sample storage for deferred analysis.
- **Referral for thorough allergy investigation**: Screening for mast cell-related disorders and recommendations for future anesthetic procedures.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^1176FzFS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the associations between tryptase elevation and the performance of basophil activation tests (BATs) among patients with perioperative anaphylaxis (PA). In our large cohort of patients with PA undergoing BATs, almost all (94.6%) positive results came from patients with significantly elevated tryptase during the index reaction. This phenomenon is reminiscent of previous reports describing the association between BAT positivity and elevated tryptase among patients experiencing reactions during desensitization with platinum compounds. Because tryptase exists (almost exclusively) within both mast cells (MCs) and basophils, significant elevation during PA may reflect the individual tendency for MC/basophil degranulation (in context with the specific drug culprit). Therefore, such individuals would have an increased likelihood of a positive BAT result with the same drug compared to those without significantly elevated tryptase levels. Furthermore, recent reports suggest a close interplay between MCs and basophils.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^1145dYLv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anaphylaxis, particularly concerning the evaluation for mastocytosis, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a baseline serum tryptase measurement in patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis. This is especially critical when there is hypotension and/or an absence of urticaria, unexplained anaphylaxis, or suspected mastocytosis. However, it is important not to rely solely on serum tryptase levels for the diagnostic assessment of the likelihood of a clonal mast cell disorder.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^111idg5m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Intra-individual variation of serum tryptase levels and event-related increases occur during massive systemic anaphylactic reactions. As previously mentioned, the basal tryptase levels in individual donors, whether patients or healthy donors, are relatively consistent when tested repeatedly over time under stable and identical conditions (Figure 3). Even in patients with a very high basal tryptase level, the intra-individual range of basal tryptase often remains rather stable over time (Figure 3).

However, there are several reasons for variations in basal tryptase levels, such as a decrease in kidney function, concomitant medications like glucocorticoids, or a myeloid neoplasm. In such myeloid neoplasms (MDS, MPN, chronic myeloid leukemia), basal tryptase levels may initially be elevated and may rise further when the numbers of tryptase-positive, neoplastic cells (MCs, basophils, or lineage-committed blasts) increase due to progression. In patients receiving corticosteroids (systemic or topical), basal serum tryptase (BST) levels may decrease. For example, Schlag et al. reported that in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, topical therapy with fluticasone (500 μg twice daily) resulted in a decrease in tryptase levels from 4.7 ng/mL to 3.8 ng/mL.

In general, such drug effects may be an issue in patients with anaphylaxis, where event-related tryptase levels and post-event (basal) tryptase levels should be compared to determine whether MCAS criteria are met, particularly when the patient is still under corticosteroid therapy but did not receive such drugs before and at the time of anaphylaxis.

### Risk assessment in anaphylaxis: Current and future approaches [^116UmPCp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Risk assessment of individuals with anaphylaxis is currently hampered by the lack of (1) an optimal and readily available laboratory test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode, and (2) an optimal method of distinguishing allergen-sensitized individuals who are clinically tolerant from those at risk for anaphylaxis episodes after exposure to the relevant allergen. Our objectives were to review the effector mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis; to explore the possibility of developing an optimal laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode and improving methods to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical reactivity; and to develop a research agenda for risk assessment in anaphylaxis.

Researchers from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology held a PRACTALL (Practical Allergy) meeting to discuss these objectives. New approaches being investigated to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis include serial measurements of total tryptase in serum during an anaphylaxis episode and measurement of baseline total tryptase levels after the episode. Greater availability of the test for mature beta-tryptase, a more specific mast cell activation marker for anaphylaxis than total tryptase, is needed. Measurement of chymase, mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, platelet-activating factor, and other mast cell products may prove to be useful. Consideration should be given to measuring a panel of mediators from mast cells and basophils.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^113Vukpj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Triggers of anaphylaxis and differential diagnosis

Most anaphylaxis triggers in this cohort, accounting for 144 (82%) of 175 cases, were foods: legumes, seeds, and nuts (36.0%, n = 58), cow's-milk proteins (28.0%, n = 45), and miscellaneous foods (25.5%, n = 41). Drugs and Hymenoptera stings were responsible for 17 events (10.6%), categorized as nonfood allergens. In 14 cases, the trigger could not be identified.

The nature of the anaphylaxis trigger was associated with variations in the severity of reactions (P = .004). We found grade 2 (79.3%) and grade 3 (15.5%) reactions with legumes, seeds, and nuts, while cow's-milk proteins were associated with grade 2 (60.0%) and grade 1 (17.8%) reactions. Serum alpha tryptase (sAT) and serum beta tryptase (sBT) did not differ as a function of the trigger in the study cohort (P = .43 for both).

- **Comparison of clinical and tryptase determinations according to anaphylaxis triggers**: In the control group, several differential diagnoses were identified. The most common was an infectious disease (33.8%, n = 48), which could present with gastrointestinal and/or cutaneous symptoms, or even cardiovascular signs in cases of septic shock. Additionally, severe acute asthma exacerbations (30.3%, n = 43), acute urticaria episodes (12.0%, n = 17), drug adverse effects mimicking anaphylaxis (11.3%, n = 16), and food poisoning (7.0%, n = 10) were also observed. Mastocytosis and mast cell activation (MCA) syndrome were present in the control group (5.6%, n = 8). In this group, epinephrine was administered to 14 patients, all of whom were hospitalized for septic shock initially misdiagnosed as anaphylaxis.

### Hereditary α-tryptasemia is associated with anaphylaxis to antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies [^114xu1PT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary α-tryptasemia, a genetic trait caused by increased α-tryptase copy number, is associated with idiopathic and venom anaphylaxis.

- **Objective**: We aimed to determine the impact of tryptase genotypes on drug-induced anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: A prospective discovery cohort of 99 patients from a referral center in Slovenia with acute anaphylaxis to drugs underwent tryptase genotyping by droplet digital PCR. For validation, we included a cohort of 26 patients from the Czech Republic. Associated inciting agents and the severity of the reactions were subsequently examined.

- **Results**: Hereditary α-tryptasemia was associated with drug-induced anaphylaxis with a prevalence of 13% (n = 13 of 99) in the discovery cohort and 15% in the validation cohort (n = 4 of 26). Hereditary α-tryptasemia was identified in every individual with elevated basal serum tryptase levels (11.6–21.9 ng/mL; n = 14) within both cohorts of patients. Hereditary α-tryptasemia was more prevalent in individuals with antibiotic- or mAb-induced anaphylaxis in both the discovery and validation cohorts (n = 13 of 51; 26%) compared to those with anaphylaxis resulting from neuromuscular blocking agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, contrast, chlorhexidine, or other drugs (n = 5 of 74; 7%; p = 0.02; odds ratio = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3–11.1). Overall, we found fewer individuals with no α-tryptase than in the general population, and there was a trend for subjects with more α-tryptase copies to have more severe reactions. Thus, among subjects with three α-tryptase copies, the prevalence of severe anaphylaxis was noteworthy.

### What the clinician should know when ordering a mast cell tryptase test: A review article for the North American practicing clinician [^112KNRkU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the most specific mast cell biomarker available in clinical laboratories. Tryptase levels in the peripheral blood contribute to the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic evaluation of the following three clinical categories:

- **Immediate hypersensitivity reactions**: Including the life-threatening systemic form known as anaphylaxis.
- **Clonal mast cell diseases and other myeloid malignancies**: Also as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents targeting mast cell survival.
- **Hereditary α-tryptasemia**: A genetic trait found in 4% to 8% of the general population associated with an increased risk of severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Rapidly evolving pathophysiology knowledge and management guidelines affect tryptase use in clinical practice, explaining the need for frequent updates. Such updates often lack context on the pathophysiology and methods regarding mast cells and tryptase, thus hampering the practicing clinician's ability to get the full picture from tryptase test results. Here, we provide the practicing physician with the 2025 state-of-the-art recommendations on tryptase use and interpretation in clinical practice, also exposing their basic, clinical, and technical foundations.

Successive additions to mast cell and tryptase research are summarized and revisited in light of today's knowledge. The review sections are titled to reflect matter-of-fact questions arising in clinical practice. Currently unmet needs of tryptase use and selected lines of ongoing research expected to influence clinical practice in the near future are also presented.

### Hypotensive shock and angio-oedema from angiotensin II receptor blocker: a class effect in spite of tripled tryptase values [^1169dnqi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In adverse reactions with shock, tripled tryptase values can support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. A 51-year-old physically fit woman experienced angio-oedema and hypotensive shock after ingesting irbesartan, requiring a noradrenaline infusion. Serum tryptase rose to three times the normal value. However, total immunoglobulin E and skin prick tests were normal. Nonallergic increases in tryptase have been observed, for example, during angio-oedema from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Additionally, bradykinin itself can degranulate mast cells acutely. We interpret the reaction as a class effect. To our knowledge, our report is one of the first on shock and angio-oedema from irbesartan.

### Diagnostic value of tryptase in food allergic reactions: A prospective study of 160 adult peanut challenges [^115jH974]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Serum tryptase is useful in diagnosing drug and venom anaphylaxis; however, its utility in food anaphylaxis is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether tryptase rises in food allergic reactions, the optimal sampling time points, and a diagnostic cutoff for confirming a clinical reaction.

- **Methods**: Characterized peanut allergic patients were recruited and underwent up to four peanut challenges and one placebo challenge each. Tryptase was measured serially on challenge days both before (baseline) and during the challenge. The peak percentage tryptase rise (peak/baseline) was related to reaction severity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, establishing an optimal diagnostic cutoff.

- **Results**: Tryptase was analyzed in 160 reactive (9% anaphylaxis) and 45 nonreactive (placebo) challenges in 50 adults aged 18 to 39 years. Tryptase rose above the normal range (11.4 ng/mL) in four out of 160 reactions. Compared with baseline levels, a rise was observed in 100 out of 160 (62.5%) reactions and 0 out of 45 placebo challenges. The median rise (95% confidence interval [CI]) for all reactions was 25% (13.3% to 33.3%), and during anaphylaxis, it was 70.8% (33.3% to 300%). Peak levels occurred at two hours and correlated with severity (P < .05). Moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms, generalized erythema, dizziness, and hypotension were correlated with a higher peak/baseline tryptase (P < .05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated the optimal cutoff to identify a reaction as a 30% rise (sensitivity 0.53; specificity 0.85), area under the curve 0.72 (95% CI, 0.6).

### Anesthetic anaphylactic shock in an emergency cesarean section: a case report [^113RmAyc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

In the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, several biochemical markers can provide additional confirmation and help guide treatment decisions. The most commonly used marker is serum tryptase, which tends to rise within 30 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of an anaphylactic reaction. Elevated tryptase levels can confirm mast cell activation, which is critical for diagnosing anaphylaxis in uncertain cases. In our patient, tryptase was measured after admission to the ICU, and the results were consistent with anaphylaxis. However, other markers, such as plasma histamine and specific IgE to the suspected allergen, could further support the diagnosis. Due to the acute nature of the case and the need for immediate intervention, we did not conduct these tests. Future cases may benefit from a more comprehensive biochemical evaluation if the clinical setting allows.

There is a high risk of complications related to airway management during cesarean sections, such as aspiration pneumonia and hypoxia, and a high incidence of difficult or failed intubation. While succinylcholine is traditionally favored for rapid sequence induction due to its rapid onset and short duration, rocuronium presents an alternative for situations where succinylcholine use may be contraindicated, such as in patients with a history of allergic reactions or those at risk of malignant hyperthermia. Rocuronium, when used in combination with a reversal agent like sugammadex, can achieve rapid recovery, making it a viable choice for cesarean sections where neuromuscular blockade is needed.

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^113rePiS]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is the most severe acute manifestation of allergic disorders, being a life‐threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction that develops rapidly. Currently, 50–112 cases per 100,000 inhabitants are registered per year, but its incidence seems to be underestimated.

Ongoing criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are clinical. However, the plethora of clinical features associated with this pathological event makes it difficult to achieve a consensus on its definition, impairing our ability to adequately manage these severe reactions. Different phenotypes and underlying endotypes have been described in anaphylaxis according to a few biomarkers, with serum tryptase being the most widely used to complement the diagnosis of this pathological event.

In recent years, the upper normality reference threshold concentration for serum tryptase has decreased from 15 μg/L to 11.4 μg/L. However, this biomarker has several drawbacks since it is not elevated in all cases, but mainly in the most severe reactions where clinical diagnosis is undoubtful. Therefore, new diagnostic criteria have been proposed. For instance, an increase in tryptase levels of 20% plus 2 μg/L from baseline to the acute phase is used to diagnose mast cell activation syndrome. In addition, the study by Borer‐Reinhold et al. established an increase above 135% of acute serum tryptase baseline values to indicate mast cell activation in patients with anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera venoms.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^114m89mx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 90 patients with an exact culprit identified and meeting all inclusion criteria were included for analysis. Seventy patients (77.8%) showed significant tryptase elevation (Fig 1, A). In 41.1% (37 of 90) of the patients, BAT results were positive to the identified culprit. BAT-positive patients presented with significantly higher absolute levels (15.9 μg/L vs 9.1 μg/L; p = 0.018), absolute elevation (12.8 μg/L vs 7.1 μg/L; p = 0.012), and fold elevation (5.6-fold vs 4.1-fold; p = 0.014) of acute tryptase than BAT-negative patients (Fig 1, B; Table I). Among patients with a positive BAT result, 94.6% (35 of 37) demonstrated elevated acute tryptase, significantly more than the BAT-negative group (66.0%; P < 0.001).

Aside from acute tryptase results, no significant differences were noted between BAT-positive and BAT-negative patients (Table II). In regression analysis, tryptase elevation was the sole significant factor correlated to BAT positivity (odds ratio, 10.14; 95% CI, 2.15–47.85; p = 0.003). In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, both acute tryptase level (area under the curve, 0.647; 95% CI, 0.529–0.765) and significant tryptase elevation (area under the curve, 0.646; 95% CI, 0.528–0.764) demonstrated satisfactory performance for BAT positivity prediction (Fig 2).

An acute tryptase level of greater than or equal to 9.0 μg/L was identified as the optimal cutoff, which has a sensitivity of 89.2%, a specificity of 50.0%, and a negative predictive value of 86.7%.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^111TPEet]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the performance of serum tryptase, we only considered episodes with an adequate sampling time and compared the patients with anaphylaxis to the control group. The CCF displayed 62.2% sensitivity and 80% specificity, with a Youden index of 0.42. Receiver operator curve analysis for rT and dT showed an area under the curve of 0.84 and 0.80, respectively, with 1.74 and 4.12 as optimal thresholds. At the optimal threshold, the sensitivity was 66.7% and 51.1% for rT and dT, with 90% specificity for both. rT was the best option to confirm anaphylaxis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hymenoptera sting allergy, more specifically with respect to serum tryptase levels, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a basal serum tryptase level measurement in patients with anaphylaxis to a sting, especially those with severe or hypotensive reactions, and in all patients with negative test results for venom-specific IgE.

### Mast cell activation test in the diagnosis of allergic disease and anaphylaxis [^11497QVd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Whether basophils are involved as effector cells in the pathophysiology of allergic reactions is unclear. Traditionally, mast cells (MCs) have been considered the main effector cells in patients with allergic reactions. After allergen exposure, these cells become activated through IgE cross-linking of FcεRI expressed on the cell surface, resulting in release and de novo synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Despite sharing allergen-mediated activation mechanisms, MCs are transcriptionally distinct and independent from circulating granulocytes. Therefore, we sought to develop an alternative approach to the diagnosis of allergic disease and anaphylaxis using primary human blood-derived mast cells (hMCs) generated from CD117+ peripheral blood precursors, which are passively sensitized with patients' sera and then incubated in vitro with allergen; this is known as the mast cell activation test (MAT). In this report, we describe the development of the MAT, its potential application in patients with peanut and insect venom allergy, and initial validation as a diagnostic tool for peanut allergy compared with existing diagnostic tests.

### Detecting changes in mast cell numbers versus activation in human disease: A roadblock for current biomarkers [^1167hn4Y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of mast cell (MC)-driven disorders is diverse, ranging from localized reactions to systemic disorders caused by abnormal accumulation and activation in multiorgan systems. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critically important for informing treatment and objectively assessing treatment outcomes. As new therapeutics are being developed to deplete MCs or silence them, for example, by engaging inhibitory receptors that block activation, new biomarkers are needed to distinguish between MC activation and burden.

Serum tryptase is the gold standard for assessing both MC burden and activation; however, commercial tryptase assays have limitations related to timing of release, lack of discernment between inactive (α) and active (β) forms of tryptase, and interpatient variability of baseline levels. Alternative approaches to measuring MC activation include urinary MC mediators, flow cytometry-based assays, or gene expression profiling. Additional markers of MC activation are needed for use in clinical diagnostics to help with the selection of treatment for MC diseases and for assessing outcomes of therapy.

We review the spectrum of disorders with known or suspected MC contribution, describe the utility and limitations of MC markers and assays, and discuss the need for new markers that can differentiate between MC activation and burden.

### Tryptase in type I hypersensitivity [^115CjEAe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the main mast cell biomarker available in medical practice. Tryptase determination is a quantitative test performed in serum or plasma for the diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of mast cell-related conditions. The continuous secretion of monomeric α and β protryptases forms the baseline tryptase level. Transient, activation-induced release of tryptase is known as acute tryptase. Because mast cells are tissue-resident cells, the detection of an acute tryptase release in the bloodstream is protracted, with a delay of 15 to 20 minutes after the onset of symptoms and a peak at approximately 1 hour. Constitutive release of tryptase is a marker of mast cell number and activity status, whereas transient release of mature tryptase is a marker of mast cell degranulation.

Although consensual as a concept, the application of this statement in clinical practice has only been clarified since 2020. For baseline tryptase to be used as a biomarker, reference values need to be established. In contrast, defining a transient increase using acute tryptase can only be achieved as a function of the baseline status.

### Predictors of severe systemic anaphylactic reactions in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy: Importance of baseline serum tryptase-a study of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology interest group on insect venom hypersensitivity [^113ZDQFd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Severe anaphylaxis to honeybee or vespid stings is associated with a variety of risk factors, which are poorly defined.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to evaluate the association of baseline serum tryptase concentrations and other variables routinely recorded during patient evaluation with the frequency of past severe anaphylaxis following a field sting.

- **Methods**: In this observational multicenter study, we enrolled 962 patients with established bee or vespid venom allergy who had a systemic reaction following a field sting. Data were collected on tryptase concentration, age, sex, culprit insect, cardiovascular medication, and the number of preceding minor systemic reactions before the index field sting. A severe reaction was defined as anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness, or cardiopulmonary arrest. The index sting was defined as the hitherto first, most severe systemic field-sting reaction. Relative rates were calculated with generalized additive models.

- **Results**: Two hundred six (21.4%) patients had a severe anaphylactic reaction following a field sting. The frequency of this event increased significantly with higher tryptase concentrations (nonlinear association). Other factors significantly associated with severe reactions following a field sting were vespid venom allergy, older age, male sex, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication, and one or more preceding field stings with a less severe systemic reaction.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with honeybee or vespid venom allergy, baseline serum tryptase concentrations are associated with the risk for severe anaphylactic reaction.

### Diagnostic value of histamine and tryptase concentrations in severe anaphylaxis with shock or cardiac arrest during anesthesia [^116KjffG]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute life-threatening allergic reactions during anesthesia relies on clinical signs, histamine and/or tryptase measurements, and allergic testing. In patients who die after the reaction, skin tests cannot be performed, and the effect of resuscitation maneuvers on mediator concentrations is unknown. The authors compared plasma histamine and tryptase concentrations in patients with severe allergic reactions during anesthesia with those measured in patients with shock due to other causes.

- **Methods**: Patients with life-threatening allergic reactions were retrieved from a previous database (Group ALLERGY). All had positive allergy tests to administered agents. Patients with severe septic/cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest (Group CONTROL) had histamine and tryptase measurements during resuscitation maneuvers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were built to calculate the optimal mediator thresholds differentiating allergic reactions from others.

- **Results**: One hundred patients were included, 75 in Group ALLERGY (cardiovascular collapse, 67; cardiac arrest, 8) and 25 in Group CONTROL (shock, 11; cardiac arrest, 14). Mean histamine and tryptase concentrations remained unchanged throughout resuscitation in Group CONTROL and were significantly higher in Group ALLERGY. The optimal thresholds indicating an allergic mechanism were determined as 6.35 nmol/l for histamine (sensitivity: 90.7% [95% CI, 81.7 to 96.1]; specificity: 91.7% [73.0 to 98.9]) and 7.35 μg/l for tryptase (sensitivity: 92% [83.4 to 97.0]; specificity: 92% [73.9 to 99.0]).

### Platelet-activating factor, histamine, and tryptase levels in human anaphylaxis [^116r7MgN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important mediator and correlates with anaphylaxis severity. How well PAF correlates with severity relative to histamine or tryptase is not known.

- **Objective**: To analyze the levels of PAF, histamine, and tryptase as a function of severity in patients with acute allergic reactions.

- **Methods**: PAF, histamine, and tryptase levels were measured in blood samples collected from 23 healthy volunteers and 41 patients during acute allergic reactions. Reactions were stratified by severity from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 3 (most severe).

- **Results**: Among the three reaction grades, there were significant differences by ANOVA for PAF (P < .0001). The proportion of elevated PAF values increased across severity groups (P = .0009). Increased PAF levels were observed in 20%, 66.7%, and 100% of the patients with grades 1, 2, and 3 allergic reactions, respectively. While the proportion of elevated histamine values increased from 40% to 57% to 70% across grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively, these were not significantly different (P = .40). For tryptase, the proportion of elevated values increased monotonically from 0 in grade 1 to 4.8% in grade 2 to 60% in grade 3 (P = .0002).

- **Conclusions**: The PAF level was significantly elevated in proportion to the severity of acute allergic reactions. Whereas the PAF level was elevated in all patients with severe anaphylaxis, this was not true for either histamine or tryptase. Neither histamine nor tryptase showed as good correlations with severity scores as did PAF.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^11122iFj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Methods - **Study population**: Patients were retrospectively included in our cohort only if at least one tryptase determination was performed during the emergency department (ED) visit and was available from the laboratory database. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected for pediatric patients (18 years or younger) admitted with a suspicion of anaphylaxis from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020, at the ED of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France. For each patient, we collected data on age, sex, atopic history (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food, drug, latex allergy), and presence of mast cell (MC)-related diseases (clonal MC diseases, mast cell activation (MCA) syndrome). At ED admission, the definition of anaphylaxis was a perceived life-threatening systemic reaction of sudden onset at the time of clinical evaluation by the physician in charge of the child's care.

Clinical manifestations were classified as mucocutaneous (rash or skin flushing, angioedema), respiratory (sneezing, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, or stridor), gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, tingling mouth, nausea, and vomiting), and cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia) symptoms. The severity was graded using the 4-class scale adapted from Ring and Messmer. Grade 1 reactions were defined by the presence of mucocutaneous symptoms only. Grade 2 reactions were characterized by the presence of any of the previous symptoms as well as moderate respiratory or digestive symptoms. Cases were categorized as grade 3 if any of the following symptoms were present: cyanosis, hypoxia (saturation < 92%), hypotension, or dysrhythmia.

### Basal serum tryptase outperforms hereditary alpha tryptasemia as a biomarker of food allergy severity [^113MuKLv]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, this is the first report describing the link between severe food anaphylaxis, BST levels, and HαT. Considering that HαT is a trait observed in most anaphylaxis patients with BST > 8 μg/L in our series, and although larger studies are required to understand the modulatory effect of HαT on reactions severity, our results suggest that, at least in food allergy, BST > 8 μg/L may serve as a severity biomarker in those settings where access to genetic study of HαT is limited.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^116gXcHJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Because elevated serum tryptase levels are detected in most HαT-positive cases, the question is whether a lower threshold level can be recommended and used to exclude the presence of HαT with some certainty. When excluding most individuals with HαT, the normal tryptase range appears to be 1.0 to 11.4 ng/mL. However, some of the HαT-positive cases have low basal tryptase levels, ranging between 8 and 11.3 ng/mL, or even lower tryptase levels. Therefore, we recommend applying 8 ng/mL as a threshold to exclude a majority of healthy individuals carrying extra copy numbers of the TPSAB1 gene (Table IV). This definition is important for clinical practice: in fact, testing for HαT should primarily be considered at a basal tryptase level of 8 ng/mL or greater, even if some cases with HαT may present with an even lower tryptase level. Levels of 11.4 ng/mL cannot be used as a solid indicator of HαT in healthy or symptomatic individuals.

It is also worth noting that, in children and younger adults, serum tryptase levels are modestly lower than in older adults. In one study, serum tryptase levels in unselected healthy controls ranged between 0 and.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^112Vn3TF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

Dynamic measurement of serum acute (sAT) and baseline (sBT) tryptase confirms mast cell degranulation during systemic hypersensitivity reactions, provided timing and interpretation are appropriate. The consensus formula requires sAT greater than a personalized cutoff value [sAT > (1.2 × sBT) + 2]. Only a few studies have investigated its diagnostic performance in children.

- **Objective**: We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the consensus formula and alternative algorithms for interpreting tryptase levels in pediatric patients with suspected anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: Medical records of suspected anaphylaxis referred to the pediatric emergency department of the University Hospitals of Marseille (France) from 2011 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data, including total tryptase and allergy evaluations, were collected. Anaphylaxis was defined as a sudden-onset, perceived life-threatening systemic reaction at the time of physician assessment. Inclusion criteria were suspected anaphylaxis and at least one tryptase determination. The diagnostic performance of the consensus formula was compared to 5 alternative tryptase interpretation algorithms.

- **Results**: Among 315 patients (median age, 7.8 years; 317 emergency department visits), 175 (55%) were categorized as cases. Food-induced anaphylaxis was diagnosed in 82%, and 92 (52.6%) had two or more tryptase determinations. The highest diagnostic performance was achieved by the sAT/sBT ratio. A cutoff for sAT/sBT ratio of > 1.74 yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 90.0% specificity, and 96.8% positive pred…

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^1169hBms]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with pleiotropic characteristics. The focus of its clinical approaches is evolving towards precision medicine. In our study, we have demonstrated better diagnostic efficiency of tryptase when based on personal values (acute/basal ratio and percentage increase compared to baseline) compared to using thresholds recommended in guidelines. Molecular determinations support a drop in serum protein concentration and HSA, as well as an increase in HBB in the acute phase.

As previously described by Sala-Cunill et al, our results concur with an increase in serum tryptase during anaphylaxis, which is well associated with the severity of the reaction. Currently, the existing clinical reference threshold for serum tryptase in this pathological event considers only the acute condition. However, it has been shown that serum tryptase measurements obtained during the acute episode should be compared with patients' baseline values. These have already been considered for the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndromes and Hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis. Consequently, all three criteria were evaluated in our sample cohorts, and results obtained showed that patients clinically characterized as anaphylaxis were better diagnosed considering their baseline values. Specifically, more than twice as many cases were correctly classified considering the increment of 135%. Nevertheless, acute and basal tryptase levels may also be elevated in several non-anaphylactic cases. Therefore, it is imperative to find new indicators to improve diagnostic accuracy.
