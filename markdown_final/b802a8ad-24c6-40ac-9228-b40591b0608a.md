## Question

best topical for onychomycosis of toe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis and how to choose among options based on evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity thresholds that guide topical versus oral therapy. Then, I should verify which topical agents have the highest-quality efficacy data and what their absolute and relative benefits are. Next, I will review safety, tolerability, and practical considerations like application, duration, and debridement. After that, I should consider special populations and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline a monitoring and follow-up plan with contingencies for nonresponse or intolerance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because treatment choice hinges on disease extent and patient factors. Mild to moderate onychomycosis, typically defined as about 20–50% nail involvement without matrix disease, is where topical monotherapy is most appropriate, whereas more extensive disease or matrix involvement generally favors oral therapy or combination approaches, and this is reflected in both primary care and specialty guidance as well as in the inclusion criteria of pivotal topical trials [^112YLKrj] [^113z5Tm2] [^112C3YoG] [^111hNBCr].

> I need to check which topical agents have the strongest evidence base. The 2020 Cochrane review identifies efinaconazole 10% solution as having high-quality evidence for superiority over vehicle for complete cure and mycological cure, with tavaborole 5% solution supported by moderate-quality evidence for complete cure and high-quality evidence for mycological cure, while ciclopirox 8% lacquer has low- to moderate-quality support and ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer (P-3051) shows moderate-quality evidence for improved complete cure versus comparators, though availability varies by region [^1127Qx9o]. Hold on, I should verify absolute effect sizes: efinaconazole achieves roughly 15–18% complete cure versus 3–6% with vehicle in phase 3 trials, and tavaborole achieves about 6.5–9% complete cure versus 0.5–1.5% with vehicle, which aligns with FDA summaries and systematic reviews [^112C3YoG] [^111hNBCr] [^112oS5w4] [^112WWQ3y] [^1153hHhZ].

> Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness among topicals, because "best" implies relative advantages. The Cochrane review notes that efinaconazole has the most consistent and highest-quality evidence signal for complete cure among topicals, with tavaborole close behind, while ciclopirox lacquer generally yields lower complete cure rates and requires monthly debridement as part of its labeled regimen, which can be a practical barrier for some patients [^1127Qx9o] [^111hpNKT]. I should confirm that head-to-head data are limited; where available, efinaconazole tends to outperform ciclopirox lacquer, and ciclopirox hydrolacquer may outperform traditional lacquer formulations, though availability and cost may limit access in some markets [^1127Qx9o] [^1145rgCL].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability, because these drive adherence over the long treatment horizon. Efinaconazole and tavaborole have predominantly local adverse effects such as application-site dermatitis, erythema, vesicles, and exfoliation, with low systemic exposure and no routine laboratory monitoring required, which is a key advantage over oral agents in polypharmacy or comorbidity contexts [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y] [^1153hHhZ]. Ciclopirox lacquer is generally well tolerated but may cause local irritation and nail discoloration, and its regimen requires monthly debridement, which can itself provoke discomfort or bleeding if not performed carefully [^111hpNKT] [^111EXHnf].

> I will now examine practical considerations that influence real-world success. All three FDA-approved topicals require once-daily application for 48 weeks with assessment at 52 weeks, so adherence and expectation-setting are critical; efinaconazole's low-surface-tension vehicle facilitates penetration to the nail bed and ventral plate, which may explain its relatively higher complete cure rates among topicals, and this pharmacotechnical advantage is clinically meaningful in onycholysis and subungual disease [^111fdrYw] [^113fgYzW] [^1145mqGW] [^114CDsPB] [^116DEWF8]. Hold on, I should verify that debridement improves outcomes; while debridement is mandatory with ciclopirox and optional with efinaconazole and tavaborole, adjunctive debridement can reduce fungal burden and may modestly enhance efficacy across agents, particularly in thicker nails, though high-quality comparative data are limited [^111hpNKT] [^117UpkWy] [^112YLKrj].

> Let me consider special populations, because this can tilt the choice toward a specific topical. In pediatrics, efinaconazole has robust safety and efficacy data and is FDA-approved down to age 6, with pediatric studies showing higher mycological and complete cure rates than adults and excellent tolerability, making it the preferred topical in children when topical therapy is indicated [^113Ym9ed] [^11481Mie]. For patients with hepatic disease, advanced age, or multiple drug interactions, topical therapy avoids systemic toxicity and is favored; efinaconazole's low systemic exposure and strong efficacy signal make it a logical first choice in these scenarios as well [^117MY5gB] [^112YLKrj].

> I should confirm where guidelines land on this question. Contemporary US expert consensus recommends efinaconazole 10% as the preferred topical agent, with tavaborole and ciclopirox as alternatives, and this aligns with the Cochrane hierarchy of evidence and FDA-labeled outcomes; British guidance similarly supports efinaconazole as a topical option for suitable distal disease presentations [^115MkSxK] [^115bUy8N] [^1127Qx9o]. But wait, what if oral therapy is feasible and the patient prioritizes speed and higher cure probability? Oral terbinafine remains the most effective monotherapy overall, yet when oral therapy is contraindicated, declined, or unsuitable, efinaconazole offers the best balance of efficacy, safety, and convenience among topicals [^113UMTeu] [^112YLKrj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "cure" expectations with topicals. I should double-check absolute complete cure rates to set realistic goals: efinaconazole achieves about 15–18% complete cure at 52 weeks, tavaborole about 6.5–9%, and ciclopirox lacquer about 7%, so even with the "best" topical, many patients will have partial clearance rather than complete cure; this underscores the value of treatment success endpoints and the potential role for extended therapy or combination strategies in selected cases [^112C3YoG] [^111hNBCr] [^112oS5w4] [^1127Qx9o]. Let me reconsider whether extending therapy helps; observational and single-arm studies suggest continued improvement beyond 48 weeks with efinaconazole, supporting extended courses in slow-growing nails or more severe disease when appropriate [^113uW4Rd] [^112n8UzX].

> Putting this together, my evidence-based recommendation is that efinaconazole 10% solution is the best topical choice for most patients with mild to moderate distal lateral subungual onychomycosis, given its highest-quality evidence for complete cure, favorable safety profile, and practical once-daily regimen without mandated debridement; tavaborole 5% solution is a reasonable alternative when efinaconazole is unavailable, not tolerated, or cost-prohibitive, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer remains an option when systemic therapy is contraindicated and the patient can adhere to monthly debridement, acknowledging its lower complete cure rates [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y] [^1153hHhZ] [^111hpNKT]. I need to ensure the care plan includes confirmatory diagnosis, baseline photography, adherence counseling, and follow-up at 12, 24, and 48 weeks to adjust expectations and consider escalation to oral therapy or combination approaches if response is inadequate by 24–36 weeks [^112YLKrj] [^113z5Tm2].

---

The best topical treatment for toenail onychomycosis is **efinaconazole 10% solution** [^115uG4C3], with the highest-quality evidence for complete cure and mycological cure [^1127Qx9o], and guideline support as first-line topical therapy [^115MkSxK]. Tavaborole 5% is a **close alternative** with moderate-quality evidence for complete cure [^1127Qx9o] and high-quality evidence for mycological cure [^1127Qx9o]. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer is less effective [^1127Qx9o] but remains an option when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated [^114q5VLm]. Treatment duration is **48 weeks** [^111fdrYw] [^111Eb71K] [^111AwtXi] for all topicals, with low systemic absorption and minimal adverse effects [^1127Qx9o] [^117MY5gB].

## Comparative efficacy of topical treatments

| **Attribute** | **Efinaconazole 10% solution** | **Tavaborole 5% solution** | **Ciclopirox 8% lacquer** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Complete cure rate | 15.2–17.8% (high-quality evidence) [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y] | 6.5–9.1% (moderate-quality evidence) [^1127Qx9o] [^111hNBCr] | 7% (low-quality evidence) [^1127Qx9o] [^112oS5w4] |
| Mycological cure rate | 53.4–55.2% (moderate-quality evidence) [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y] | 31.1–35.9% (high-quality evidence) [^1127Qx9o] [^111hNBCr] | 29–36% (low-quality evidence) [^notfound] |
| Evidence quality | High | Moderate | Low |

---

Efinaconazole has the **highest complete cure rate** and robust evidence, making it the preferred topical agent [^1127Qx9o] [^115MkSxK]. Tavaborole is a **strong alternative**, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate efinaconazole [^1127Qx9o] [^111hNBCr]. Ciclopirox is less effective but may be considered when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated [^112oS5w4] [^114q5VLm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Recent guidelines and expert consensus **recommend efinaconazole 10% solution** as the first-line topical treatment for mild-to-moderate toenail onychomycosis [^115MkSxK] [^113z5Tm2]. Tavaborole 5% solution is recommended as an alternative, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate efinaconazole or when efinaconazole is unavailable [^notfound]. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer is recommended when first-line agents are contraindicated or unavailable [^114q5VLm].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Topical antifungal treatments generally have favorable safety profiles, with minimal systemic absorption and low risk of systemic adverse effects [^1127Qx9o] [^113Ym9ed]. Common local adverse effects include mild irritation, erythema, and dermatitis [^1127Qx9o]. Efinaconazole and tavaborole have similar safety profiles, while ciclopirox may cause **local irritation** and nail discoloration [^112C3YoG] [^111hNBCr] [^1127Qx9o].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity of infection**: Topical treatments are most effective for mild-to-moderate infections (≤ 50% nail involvement) [^115uG4C3] [^112YLKrj].
- **Age**: Pediatric patients may respond better to topical treatments due to thinner, faster-growing nails [^113Ym9ed] [^112B36bU].
- **Comorbidities**: Patients with liver disease, immunosuppression, or other contraindications to systemic therapy may benefit from topical treatments [^117MY5gB] [^1158mkjV].
- **Patient preference**: Convenience, ease of application, and minimal side effects are important considerations [^112YLKrj] [^117MY5gB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Efinaconazole 10% solution is the **best topical treatment** for toenail onychomycosis, with the highest-quality evidence for efficacy and strong guideline support [^1127Qx9o] [^115MkSxK]. Tavaborole 5% solution is a **close alternative** with moderate-quality evidence for complete cure [^1127Qx9o] [^111hNBCr]. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer is less effective but remains an option when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated [^114q5VLm]. Treatment duration is **48 weeks** for all topical agents, with minimal systemic absorption and favorable safety profiles [^111fdrYw] [^117MY5gB].

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^112rKjrb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis? [^112pHtES]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains a difficult disorder to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents; and not all patients are cured. Clinical experience leads us to suggest a number of host-related factors can affect the chance of cure, but studies supporting these observations are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly on topical agents, rely on severity classification when selecting patients for inclusion, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. In addition, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

Methods

Post hoc pooled analysis of two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in 1655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once-daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week post treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement), moderate (30%-39%), and moderately severe (40%-50%) at baseline.

Results

Overall, 25%, 23%, and 52% of patients had mild, moderate, or moderately severe disease at baseline. Baseline nail involvement did not appear to predict treatment outcomes. The proportion of patients with mild disease who had a clear nail progressively reduced by week 36 (58%) and week 48 (41%), and even further by week 52 (37%). Of the 237 patients treated with efinaconazole who were 'clear' at week 52, 37%, 24%, and 39% had mild, moderate or moderately severe disease respectively at baseline. The majority of patients (N = 634) saw at least a 50% improvement in their target toenail by week 52. Almost half of these patients (N = 312, 49.2%) were moderately severe at baseline.

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports previous data showing good efficacy of efinaconazole in mild onychomycosis. The relative contribution to overall efficacy results at week 52 of patients with moderate or moderately severe disease was unexpected for a topical therapy, and warrants further study, especially as they represent the majority of patients enrolled in the two studies. It is possible that comparable efficacy can be achieved in these more severe patients with longer treatment courses, or follow-up. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(2):175–178.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158mkjV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds that accounts for approximately 50% of all nail-related disease.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

Results

Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that oral and topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis are safe and effective in producing mycological cure. What's already known about this topic? Topical treatments traditionally have lower success rates than oral treatments. Oral treatments have the advantage of shorter treatment durations, but also present challenges in cases of drug-drug interactions or immunosuppression. A network meta-analysis (NMA) gathers data from indirect evidence to gain confidence about all treatment comparisons and allows for estimation of comparative effects that have not been investigated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs). What does this study add? This NMA of efficacy and safety includes all RCTs of oral, topical, combination and device-based treatments for toenail onychomycosis, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMA. The odds of achieving mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg were significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^115uG4C3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^115XnbG5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076–1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):253–262.

### Efinaconazole topical solution, 10%: the benefits of treating onychomycosis early [^115fZRgk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in onychomycosis patients with early and long-standing disease.

Methods

An analysis of 1655 patients, aged 18–70 years, randomized to receive efinaconazole topical solution, 10% or vehicle from two identical multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 48-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy. The primary end point was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at Week 52. Three groups were compared: those with early disease (< 1year), patients with a baseline disease of 1–5 years, and those with long-standing onychomycosis (> 5years).

Results

The majority of patients had long-standing disease; were older, male and white. While nail involvement of the target toenail did not differ noticeably amongst the three groups, the number of nails involved did increase progressively with disease duration. Differences were seen in terms of infecting pathogens in early disease that might have important treatment implications. Efinaconazole was more effective in treating early disease, however more than 40% of patients with long-standing disease were considered treatment successes.

Limitations

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

Conclusions

Treatment of onychomycosis early to avoid disease progression to other toenails is important. Once daily efinaconazole topical solution, 10% is particularly effective in these patients.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution for onychomycosis treatment in pediatric patients [^113Ym9ed]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric onychomycosis management is challenging as there are limited treatment options. The objective of this study was to evaluate efinaconazole 10% topical solution in children with onychomycosis.

Methods

This phase 4, multicenter, open-label study (NCT02812771) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in pediatric participants (6–16 years). Efinaconazole was administered once daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow up. Participants had culture-positive, mild-to-severe distal lateral subungual onychomycosis affecting at least 20% of at least 1 great toenail. The PK subset included participants 12–16 years with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis affecting at least 50% of each great toenail and onychomycosis in at least 4 additional toenails.

Results

Of 62 enrolled participants, 60 were included in the safety population and 17 in the PK population. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution was well tolerated. The concentration-time profiles for efinaconazole and its major metabolite were relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations during the 24-hour dosing interval. Systemic exposure to efinaconazole was low. By week 52, 65.0% of participants achieved mycologic cure, with a 36.7% mycologic cure rate observed as early as week 12. A total of 40.0% of participants achieved complete cure, 50.0% achieved clinical efficacy, and 88.3% achieved fungal cure by week 52.

Conclusion

Efinaconazole was safe and efficacious in pediatric participants with mild-to-severe onychomycosis, with improved mycologic cure and complete cure rates compared with adults from two 52-week studies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(9):867–872. doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5401.

### Efinaconazole 10% solution in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: two phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies [^112C3YoG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail infection, often resulting in nail plate damage and deformity. Topical lacquer treatments have negligible efficacy. Oral treatments, although more efficacious, are limited by drug interactions and potential hepatotoxicity.

Objective

We investigated the safety and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% solution (efinaconazole), the first triazole antifungal developed for distal lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Methods

Two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted in patients with toenail distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (20%-50% clinical involvement [study 1: N = 870, study 2: N = 785]). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole or vehicle, once daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Debridement was not performed. The primary end point was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at week 52.

Results

Mycologic cure rates were significantly greater with efinaconazole (study 1: 55.2%, study 2: 53.4%) compared with vehicle (P < .001). The primary end point, complete cure, was also significantly greater for efinaconazole (study 1: 17.8% vs 3.3%, study 2: 15.2% vs 5.5%, P < .001). Treatment success (percent affected target toenail [0%- ≤ 10%]) for efinaconazole ranged from 21.3% to 44.8% in study 1 and from 17.9% to 40.2% in study 2, compared with 5.6% to 16.8% and 7.0% to 15.4%, respectively, with vehicle. Adverse events associated with efinaconazole were local site reactions (2%) and clinically similar to vehicle.

Limitations

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

Conclusions

Once daily topical efinaconazole appears to be a viable alternative to oral treatment options for onychomycosis.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^111khEPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

Main Results

Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12–0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^113MfTo1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### Managing assessments and expectations: patient responses following therapy with efinaconazole topical solution, 10% [^111nUh1S]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Successful treatment of onychomycosis is both a clinical and therapeutic challenge. Effective patient education and reassurance are critical. This post hoc analysis aims to provide some guidance to physicians based on initial disease severity and influencing factors.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in mild to moderate onychomycosis. Outcomes were assessed based on baseline severity (20%-29%, 30%-39%, 40%-49%, and ≥ 50% affected target toenail).

Results

Overall, the mean percent affected toenail following efinaconazole treatment decreased from 36.4% to 20.6% (a 43% reduction). The percent reduction in mean percent affected toenail (range, 43.6% to 59.8%) with efinaconazole was similar irrespective of baseline severity. Improvement was only seen in the very mildest patients with vehicle and not before week 36. Improvement was influenced by gender (females did better) and disease duration (long standing disease responding less well).

Conclusions

Our onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole might expect a 50% improvement in their disease within a year, and this will be seen as significant by many, especially those who have suffered for many years. Many will do better, but they will need to be reminded of the slow growth of the toenail.

### Individual article: updated review of topical pharmaceuticals and complementary and alternative medications for the treatment of onychomycosis in both general and special populations in the United States [^117SAvvE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a prevalent condition affecting the United States and global population. Treatment options are limited, with only 3 topical anti-fungal medications garnering approval in the US within the last 25 years: ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole. The economic impact and quality of life burden due to onychomycosis are high. Here we provide an up-to-date review of all approved topical anti-fungal therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

### Tavaborole 5% topical solution for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in pediatric patients: results from a phase 4 open-label study [^115iUnD1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of tavaborole in pediatric patients.
Study Design: In this open-label, single-arm study, pediatric patients (aged 6 to < 17 years) with distal subungual onychomycosis affecting ≥ 20% of the target great toenail applied tavaborole once daily to all affected toenails (2 drops/great toenail, 1 drop/other toenail) for 48 weeks. In addition, a maximal-use subgroup (aged 12 to < 17 years) applied tavaborole to all 10 toenails and ≤ 2 mm of surrounding skin for the first 28 days.

Results: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 55.6% of patients; the most frequently reported (≥ 5% of patients) were nasopharyngitis, contusion, sinusitis, and vomiting. Most TEAEs and local treatment reactions (LTRs) were mild or moderate and considered unrelated to treatment. There was 1 serious AE (severe appendicitis, considered unrelated to treatment) and there were no deaths, discontinuations because of AEs, or dose adjustments because of AEs. The most frequently reported LTRs were erythema and scaling. The incidence of LTRs diminished over time. Tavaborole was absorbed systemically, and plasma concentrations were measurable. The PK parameters determined in this study under maximal-use conditions indicate that steady state was achieved within the study period. For efficacy, 8.5% of patients achieved complete cure (clear nail and negative mycology [negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide wet mount]) at week 52, and 14.9% achieved complete/almost complete cure at week 52 (clear or almost clear nail [≤ 5% dystrophic or discolored distal toenail plate] and negative mycology).

Conclusion: Tavaborole was well tolerated in this pediatric population, and safety, PK, and efficacy profiles were comparable with those in adults.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^116NHpM1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, using therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance, and, in cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### Efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution, 5%, a novel boron-based antifungal agent, for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: results from 2 randomized phase-III studies [^111hNBCr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, can impact quality of life.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution, 5% for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

In 2 phase-III trials, adults with distal subungual onychomycosis affecting 20% to 60% of a target great toenail were randomized 2:1 to tavaborole or vehicle once daily for 48 weeks. The primary end point was complete cure of the target great toenail (completely clear nail with negative mycology) at week 52. Secondary end points included completely or almost clear nail, negative mycology, completely or almost clear nail plus negative mycology, and safety.

Results

Rates of negative mycology (31.1%-35.9% vs 7.2%-12.2%) and complete cure (6.5% and 9.1% vs 0.5% and 1.5%) significantly favored tavaborole versus vehicle (P ≤ .001). Completely or almost clear nail rates also significantly favored tavaborole versus vehicle (26.1%-27.5% vs 9.3%-14.6%; P < .001). Rates of completely or almost clear nail plus negative mycology (15.3%-17.9% vs 1.5%-3.9%) were significantly greater for tavaborole versus vehicle (P < .001). Application-site reactions with tavaborole included exfoliation (2.7%), erythema (1.6%), and dermatitis (1.3%).

Limitations

Duration of follow-up is a limitation.

Conclusion

Tavaborole demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile in treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

### Number of affected nails is the primary determinant of efinaconazole 10% solution usage for onychomycosis [^115GBGAt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Good adherence to treatment is necessary for the successful treatment of onychomycosis and requires that an appropriate amount of medication be prescribed. Most prescriptions for efinaconazole 10% solution, a topical azole antifungal, are for 4 mL per month but there are no data on patient factors or disease characteristics that impact how much medication is needed. Data from two phase 3 studies of efinaconazole 10% solution for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis were pooled and analyzed to determine monthly medication usage based on the number of affected toenails, percent involvement of the target toenail, body mass index (BMI), and sex. Participants with two or more affected nails required, on average, > 4 mL of efinaconazole per month, with increasing amounts needed based on the number of nails with onychomycosis (mean: 4.39 mL for 2 nails; 6.36 mL for 6 nails). In contrast, usage was not greatly impacted by target toenail involvement, BMI, or sex. Together, these data indicate that the number of affected nails should be the major consideration when determining the monthly efinaconazole quantity to prescribe.

### Topical antifungal treatment prevents recurrence of toenail onychomycosis following cure [^111gW8XQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrence rates are high for onychomycosis, with prophylactic topical antifungal use proposed to counter recurrence. Although this is a reasonable action for many clinicians, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy of topical prophylaxis. A retrospective chart review (2010–2015) was conducted in patients receiving oral terbinafine or itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Following complete cure, a topical antifungal (amorolfine, bifonazole, ciclopirox olamine, or terbinafine spray) was used weekly as prophylaxis. Recurrence was recorded along with patient characteristics including demographics and concomitant medical conditions. Data from 320 patients were collected. Recurrence was significantly lower in patients receiving topical antifungal prophylaxis than in no prophylactic treatment following oral terbinafine (p < .001), but not itraconazole (p = .185). Regardless of oral treatment, the use of topical antifungals as prophylaxis (p < .001) decreased, and the number of affected toenails (p = .048) and family history of fungal infections (p < .001) increased the likelihood that recurrence would occur. This study supports the use of topical antifungal medications as prophylactic treatment to help prevent recurrence of toenail onychomycosis and suggests that those with a family history of fungal infections should be closely monitored.

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

Results

Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; p = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; p = 0.007, RR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11–2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; p = 0.02, RR = 1.45 [95% CI, 1.04–2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; p = 0.03, RR = 1.71 [95% CI, 1.05–2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (χ² = 1.63; p = 0.65).

Limitations

The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.

### The efficacy and safety of tavaborole, a novel, boron-based pharmaceutical agent: phase 2 studies conducted for the topical treatment of toenail onychomycosis [^115hqsVz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the potential efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing concentration of tavaborole, a novel, boron-based pharmaceutical agent with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail due to dermatophytes.

Methods

One double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study (study 1) and two open-label studies (studies 2 and 3) examined the efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing concentration of tavaborole topical solution applied once daily or three times weekly for 180 days at concentrations of 1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, or 7.5%. Patient cohort 3 of study 2 received open-label tavaborole 5.0% once daily for 360 days. All three studies assessed day 180 treatment success, defined as complete or partial clinical evidence of clear nail growth plus negative fungal culture.

Results

A total of 336 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) or modified ITT populations and efficacy analyses across the 3 studies. In study 1, treatment success rates at day 180 were higher with tavaborole 2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5% vs vehicle (27%, 26%, and 32% vs 14%, respectively; slope P = 0.030). In cohort 3 of study 2, 7% of patients achieved treatment success with tavaborole 5.0% at day 360. Negative culture rates at day 180 in study 1 were numerically higher for tavaborole 2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5% vs vehicle (slope P = 0.046). Application-site reactions of general irritation, erythema, scaling, and stinging/burning were most common with tavaborole 7.5%, were generally mild to moderate, and resolved with treatment discontinuation and/or a reduction in dosing frequency. No systemic safety concerns were observed.

Conclusion

Tavaborole solution demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety in phase 2 clinical studies. Based on these findings, tavaborole topical solution, 5% was further investigated in larger, more definitive phase 3 studies. Results from these completed phase 3 studies will provide additional evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of tavaborole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

### How to improve cure rates for the management of onychomycosis [^113BXkm1]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

To improve the treatment of onychomycosis clinicians need to identify correctly the causative organism, choose a therapy that is effective against the pathogen, and take into consideration the pharmacokinetics (eg, bioavailability, drug interactions) of the oral agent. In addition, variations of the standard regimens may need to be considered (ie, booster or supplemental therapy). To reduce the recurrence of onychomycosis, once mycologic cure has been achieved, clinicians should educate their patients about proper foot care. Familiarity with the symptoms and signs of tinea pedis and onychomycosis may enable patients to seek appropriate care when the disease is at an early stage.

### Long-term follow-up of onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole [^113uW4Rd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains difficult to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents. Clinical trials on efinaconazole and tavaborole included 48 weeks' daily treatment regimens with a 4-week follow-up. It has been suggested that either a longer treatment regimen or longer follow-up would lead to even better results, primarily due to the time taken for the diseased nail to grow out, especially in those patients with more severe disease.

Objective

To investigate the impact of a longer follow-up period on the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in patients with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis.

Methods

&Single center, open-labeled study in 23 subjects aged 18–80 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of moderate-to-severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (40–75% clinical involvement). Subjects were treated with efinaconazole 10% solution, once-daily for 48 weeks, with two 12-week post-treatment follow-ups (at week 60 and 72). Primary efficacy endpoint was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture). Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure rates and treatment success (defined as those patients who had at least a 50% improvement in affected toenail from baseline).

Results

Twenty-two subjects completed the study. Mean baseline age 59.4 years (range, 37–77), predominance of male subjects (73.9%). Median baseline severity 50% affected target toenail. At week 72, two subjects were complete cures and 56.5% of subjects achieved treatment success. There were no complete cures at week 48, but 39.1% achieved treatment success. Mycologic cure rates were 91.3% at week 48. Median percent affected target toenail reduced to 40%, and further to 25% (week 48 and 72, respectively). Treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse events related to medication.

Conclusions

This single-center phase 4 study supports previous data showing good efficacy and tolerability of efinaconazole in moderately severe onychomycosis. Continued reduction in disease severity post-treatment suggest that a longer follow-up of patients treated with efinaconazole would afford better efficacy results, as indicated by greater treatment success, and increase in number of subjects who became complete cures.

### Tavaborole [^1153hHhZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials. Tavaborole topical solution or vehicle was applied once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with 20% to 60% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement.

A total of 1194 subjects (795 tavaborole topical solution, 399 Vehicle) 18 to 88 years of age, 82% male, 84% white, participated in these two trials. Efficacy assessments were made at 52 weeks following a 48-week treatment period.

The Complete Cure efficacy endpoint included negative mycology (negative KOH wet mount and negative fungal culture) and Completely Clear Nail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis as evidenced by a normal toenail plate, no onycholysis, and no subungual hyperkeratosis). Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^117MY5gB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### Effect of onychomycosis and treatment on patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes: a systematic review [^111B3Tnp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, often causing physical, emotional, and aesthetic consequences. The effect of both the condition itself and treatment on quality of life has not been well studied.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to systematically review the available literature describing the effect of onychomycosis and treatment on quality of life.

Methods

We performed a search of the onychomycosis literature published before April 13, 2020. Articles were included in the review if primary data were presented, patient-reported outcome measures were used, and onychomycosis was specifically examined.

Results

Thirty studies were included in the final analysis. Poorest quality-of-life scores were associated with women and fingernail involvement. Quality-of-life scores improved from baseline with all treatment types; there were greater improvements reported with oral treatments compared with topical ones.

Conclusions

This review affirms that onychomycosis significantly influences quality of life, warranting effective treatment. All treatments resulted in quality-of-life improvements; however, studies on oral and topical therapies were of higher quality than those evaluating devices. Increased efforts are needed to understand the effect of the disease and therapy as assessed by validated, nail-specific outcome measures that accurately assess patients' cosmetic, physical, and social difficulties.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^112YLKrj]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^113CScMT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective, but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have less serious side effects, yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article will provide an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Results

Early data are promising, however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

Conclusion

Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Therapies for the treatment of onychomycosis [^112QUz1v]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^1146vjAy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### The use of topical therapies to treat onychomycosis [^115AHcEn]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The management of onychomycosis using topical agents has improved with the introduction of ciclopirox and amorolfine nail lacquers; other topical agents may be less effective. The combination of a nail lacquer with an oral antifungal agent may further improve efficacy rates in certain clinical presentations (eg, among those individuals with severe onychomycosis). Topical agents have a favorable adverse events profile. Further studies are required on the treatment of onychomycosis with nail lacquers.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^1179TFEz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

Objectives

A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent).

Results

There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 ± 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 ± 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 ± 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 ± 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 ± 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 ± 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 ± 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 ± 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 ± 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 ± 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^112n8UzX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We evaluated the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in long‐term use, for up to 72 weeks, for onychomycosis, including severe cases. Among 605 participants, 219 patients diagnosed as having onychomycosis were evaluated for the efficacy of efinaconazole. The treatment success rate (< 10% clinical involvement of the target toenail) at the final assessment time point was 56.6%, the complete cure rate was 31.1% and the mycological cure rate was 61.6%, all of which increased over time, demonstrating that continuous application contributed to the improvement of cure rate. Even in severe cases, reduction of the affected nail area was observed, showing the potential efficacy of the treatment. Responses to a quality of life questionnaire among patients with onychomycosis, OnyCOE‐t, suggested that efinaconazole treatment improved the patients' quality of life. The incidence of adverse drug reaction in the patients eligible for the assessment was 6.3%, and this developed only in the administration site in all cases. No systemic adverse event was observed. In addition, no increase in the incidence of adverse drug reaction due to long‐term use was found. Efinaconazole therapy was proved to exhibit excellent balance between efficacy and safety, and thus may serve as a useful treatment option for onychomycosis.

### Tavaborole in difficult-to-treat onychomycosis cases: a post-hoc assessment of phase III subjects [^1152MzUG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Toenail onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection that often requires prolonged treatment in order to effectively manage pathogenic organisms and obtain a clear nail. Traditionally, certain clinical features of onychomycosis, including the presence of substantial lateral disease, focal fungal masses, yellow/brown streaks, and extensive nail involvement (ie, > 50%), indicate a poor treatment prognosis and have proven difficult-to-treat with oral or traditional topical therapies. Owing to the novel features of topical tavaborole, we sought to understand the potential utility of tavaborole in difficult-to-treat onychomycosis. A blinded, post-hoc assessment of Phase III trials was conducted, focusing on initial presentation, midpoint assessment (24 weeks), and final outcomes (52 weeks) in subjects identified as having difficult-to-treat onychomycosis and treated for 48 weeks with once-daily application of either tavaborole 5% solution or vehicle. Our post-hoc analysis identified 84 difficult-to-treat cases (tavaborole 5%; n = 60; vehicle, n = 24) in subjects with toenail onychomycosis due to Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes. No subjects identified as difficult-to-treat and treated with vehicle achieved a complete cure, while 6 subjects treated with tavaborole 5% attained a completely clear nail and negative mycology. Similarly, 7 subjects treated with tavaborole 5% solution achieved an almost complete cure (≤ 10% involvement and negative mycology) while 1 subject on vehicle achieved an almost complete cure. We present a case series of 4 patients, of varying age and difficult-to-treat clinical features, which responded positively to tavaborole 5% solution. Three of the subjects achieved complete cure after being treated with tavaborole 5%, with one additional subject (an 88-year-old female) achieving an almost complete clear nail by treatment end. The outcomes presented here may not be reflective of patients that may present with these clinical characteristics. Additional investigations would be useful in order to assess the value of topical tavaborole 5% solution in difficult-to-treat clinical presentations of onychomycosis.

### Toenail onychomycosis treated with a fractional carbon-dioxide laser and topical antifungal cream [^114KDXXE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional pharmacotherapy for onychomycosis has low to moderate efficacy and may be associated with adverse reactions and medication interactions limiting its use in many patients.

Objective

We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of a fractional carbon-dioxide laser with topical antifungal therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis.

Methods

In all, 24 patients were treated with fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy and a topical antifungal cream. The laser treatment consisted of 3 sessions at 4-week intervals. Efficacy was assessed based on the response rate from standardized photographs, a microscopic examination of subungual debris, and subjective evaluations.

Results

Among the patients, 92% showed a clinical response and 50% showed a complete response with a negative microscopic result. The factors that influenced a successful outcome were the type of onychomycosis and the thickness of the nail plate before treatment. The treatment regimen was well tolerated and there was no recurrence 3 months after the last treatment episode.

Limitations

The study followed up only 24 patients and there were no relevant treatment controls.

Conclusions

Fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy, combined with a topical antifungal agent, was effective in the treatment of onychomycosis. It should be considered an alternative therapeutic option in patients for whom systemic antifungal agents are contraindicated.

### Ciclopirox topical solution, 8% combined with oral terbinafine to treat onychomycosis: a randomized, evaluator-blinded study [^113A8xmL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This randomized, evaluator-blind, 3-arm parallel, comparator controlled, multicenter pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox nail lacquer topical solution, 8% in combination with oral terbinafine for the treatment of moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis (≥ 60% disease involvement of target nail and/or lunula/matrix involvement) (N = 73). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day, followed by 4 weeks of rest (no terbinafine), then another 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day (PLs); ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (PL12); or terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (L12). At week 48, mycological cure (negative microscopy and culture) occurred in 66.7% (14/21) (PL8), 70.4% (19/27) (PL12), and 56.0% (14/25) (L12) of patients confirmed dermatophyte positive, respectively (P: not significant). At this time point, effective cure (simultaneous mycological cure and ≥ 90% reduction in the disease area) was observed in 40.0% (8/20), 33.3% (8/24), and 34.8% (8/23) of patients, respectively (P: not significant). The PLs regimen was well-tolerated and had high compliance. The data suggest that combination therapy (PL8) may be an alternative regimen to continuous terbinafine (L12) in the treatment of moderate to severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

### Topical tavaborole in the treatment of onychomycosis complicated by dermatophytoma: a post-hoc assessment of phase II subjects [^112AaCTv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoma is a little-known, difficult to treat fungal infection that complicates onychomycosis. First described by Roberts and Evans in the late 1990's, dermatophytoma presents as a dense concentration of fungal hyphae within or under the nail plate and is generally white or yellow/brown in color, and linear (streaks) or round (patches) in shape; primary etiologic organisms are dermatophytes. Oral antifungals have limited success in treating dermatophytoma owing to difficulties accessing and penetrating what is hypothesized to be a fungal biofilm. In this respect, dermatophytoma is generally treated with a combination therapy approach, often including both surgical and pharmacologic intervention for improved outcomes. A post-hoc assessment of Phase II tavaborole onychomycosis studies was conducted in order to assess the prevalence of dermatophytoma and outcomes in patients treated with topical tavaborole. Of the 366 subjects enrolled in the Phase II onychomycosis studies, we identified 102 cases of dermatophytoma; 21 of 86 (24.4%) subjects treated with tavaborole were able to achieve complete resolution of dermatophytoma by day 180, while no subjects on vehicle obtained resolution. Similarly, 23 of 86 subjects (26.7%) treated with tavaborole solution had complete resolution of dermatophytoma by day 360, while only 1 of 16 subjects (6.3%) on vehicle obtained resolution. Moreover, 13 of 19 subjects (68.4%) treated with tavaborole solution were able to sustain resolution, while only 6 of 19 (31.6%) had reoccurrence, of dermatophytoma during the 180-day washout period (day 360). We present 5 cases of dermatophytoma identified in Phase II trials that responded in a positive manner following treatment with tavaborole solution for onychomycosis of the great toenail. Although not representative of all subject outcomes, these findings provide insight into the use of topical tavaborole for dermatophytoma, a condition previously thought to respond only to oral or combination therapy.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infection and at least 6 months in toenail infection) as an alternative in patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Obtain baseline LFTs and a CBC. Monitor LFTs in high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk because of concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Are boosters or supplementation of antifungal drugs of any use for treating onychomycosis? [^1113EWYk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that there is a finite failure rate when treating onychomycosis; a case report from the author serves as an example of multiple failures following treatments of varying duration and combinations, including oral-local, then oral-oral therapies. This article discusses the results obtained by authors who have varied the standard duration of therapy, increased the dosage of the oral antifungal agents, or have used two oral drugs in treating this condition.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^114Ka8p4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

### Labeled use of efinaconazole topical solution 10% in treating onychomycosis in children and a review of the management of pediatric onychomycosis [^11481Mie]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a difficult to treat condition whose prevalence is increasing. Until recently, there was no FDA approved antifungal agent for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. Although systemic antifungal agents are effective, their use is restricted by the potential adverse events and drug-drug interactions. There is evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of topical antifungal agents for pediatric onychomycosis. We have summarized the results of a recently published study using efinaconazole topical solution 10% to treat onychomycosis in children and discuss management of pediatric onychomycosis. In a multicenter, open-label phase 4 study, efinaconazole 10% solution was applied topically once daily in children aged 6 to 16years with mild to severe, culture positive, distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis. Treatment was for 48weeks with a follow-up at week 52. Pharmacokinetics was performed in a subset of patients. There were 62 patients enrolled in the study. At week 52, the efficacy was mycological cure rate 65% and complete cure rate 40%. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were mild to moderate in severity with none resulting in study discontinuation. The only treatment-related TEAE was ingrown toenail. Efinaconazole was detected at low levels in plasma. Efinaconazole topical solution 10% is effective and safe in treating onychomycosis in children age 6 to 16years and was recently FDA-approved for this indication. The on-label use of other topical agents, tavaborole solution 5% and ciclopirox nail lacquer solution 8% is reviewed. We also briefly discuss the use of oral agents, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole in pediatric onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: factors contributing to recurrence [^112dVcoD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years and many patients can now expect a complete and lasting cure. However, for up to 25% of patients, persistent disease remains a problem, thus presenting a particular challenge to the clinician. For these patients, it is obviously important to ensure that a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis has been made, as misdiagnosis will inevitably jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumours vascular disorders and inflammatory diseases. Predisposing factors that contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy include the presence of a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease and yellow spikes. However, poor penetration of systemic agents to the centre of infection, or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below, probably contributes to this. Other factors contributing to recurrence may be related to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle or underlying physiology. In addition, patients with concomitant disease (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60%, and increases with age; in this population, physical trauma plays a major role in precipitating recurrence, especially in patients with faulty biomechanics due to underlying arthritis and bone abnormalities. It is also possible that recurrence in some cases is due to early termination of treatment or use of an inappropriate dose, and these possibilities should be eliminated before further investigations are undertaken. There is good evidence to suggest that a combination of oral and topical therapies, when given at the same time, yield excellent clinical outcomes, although there remains a need for more effective topical agents with greater nail penetration and more effective oral antifungal agents.

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^116P8zSy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, and is the most common of the nail disorders. Current therapies for onychomycosis have less than ideal efficacy and have the potential for adverse effects. As previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis. The primary endpoint was safety of the device, and secondary outcome measures were clinical efficacy and mycological cure. Patient satisfaction was measured using questionnaires at the completion of the study. All but one patient met the primary endpoint of safety and there were no long-term sequelae. The overall clinical cure was 53.8% and the mycological cure was 15.4%. The majority of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Terbinafine [^115r4cXZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

Information for Patients

Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.

The patient should be told to:

Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is for external use only.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.
Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).
Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).
Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.
A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.
Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.
Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.

### Ciclopirox nail lacquer for the treatment of onychomycosis: an open non-comparative study [^111pd8ME]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a relatively common disease accounting for up to 50% of all nail disorders. Topical treatment, although less effective than systemic, is usually preferred by patients. Topical antifungal nail lacquers have been formulated to provide better delivery of the antifungal agent to the nail unit. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclopirox nail lacquer in the treatment of onychomycosis. Patients suffering from distal and lateral subungual toenail onychomycosis (DLSO) and lateral subungual onychomycosis (LSO) were treated by ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 9 months. Every week the nail lacquer was removed using acetone. Clinical nail status, KOH examination and mycological culture were recorded by the same investigator at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Thirty-six patients completed the 9-month regimen. Trichophyton rubrum was the most common pathogen. At the end of the study, good improvement to complete cure was observed in 13 patients (36%), 12 patients showed only mild to moderate improvement and 11 patients (31%) had no clinical improvement. No adverse effects were noted throughout the treatment period. Ciclopirox nail lacquer seems to be slightly more effective than other topical modalities and could be used in patients who cannot or do not want systemic treatment.

### Ingrown toenail management [^1167kam4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingrown toenails account for approximately 20% of foot problems in primary care. The great toe is most often affected. Ingrown toenails occur most commonly in young men, and nail care habits and footwear are most often contributory factors. No consensus has been reached for the best treatment approach, but ingrown nails may be nonsurgically or surgically treated. Nonsurgical treatments are typically used for mild to moderate ingrown nails, whereas surgical approaches are used in moderate and severe cases. Simple nonsurgical palliative measures include correcting inappropriate footwear, managing hyperhidrosis and onychomycosis, soaking the affected toe followed by applying a mid- to high-potency topical steroid, and placing wisps of cotton or dental floss under the ingrown lateral nail edge. Application of a gutter splint to the ingrown nail edge to separate it from the lateral fold provides immediate pain relief. A cotton nail cast made from cotton and cyanoacrylate adhesive, taping the lateral nail fold, or orthonyxia may also alleviate mild to moderate ingrown toenail. Surgical approaches seek to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and inflammatory reaction. These approaches are superior to nonsurgical ones for preventing recurrence. The most common surgical approach is partial avulsion of the lateral edge of the nail plate. Matrixectomy further prevents recurrence and can be performed through surgical, chemical, or electrosurgical means.

### Real-world effectiveness of a fractional COlaser with topical antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^1122n48S]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Current therapeutic agents for onychomycosis have limited efficacy or cause side effects. Recently, successful treatment using fractional CO₂ lasers has been reported; however, the results are inconsistent. We analyzed the real-world effectiveness of a Fractional CO₂ laser for the treatment of Onychomycosis A single-center retrospective chart review was conducted during January 2015-December 2018. Patients, diagnosed with onychomycosis through fungal culture and/or potassium hydroxide staining, underwent three or more fractional CO₂ laser treatments and used topical antifungal agents. Treatment effects were assessed by using clinical images at 6, 12months, and the last visit. Ninety-six patients were included; they underwent an average of 7.7 laser treatment sessions. Finally, 15 patients (15.6%) showed complete response (100% clearing of all nails), 24 patients (25%) showed partial response, and 57 patients (59.4%) showed no response (no 100% clearing of nails among all treated toenails per patient including mild improvement or temporary cosmetic improvement). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed longer disease duration (p = 0.006, OR = 1.16 [95% CI: 1.05–1.31]), patients with diabetes (p = 0.021, OR = 9.82 [95% CI: 1.75–94.01]) and fewer number of laser treatment sessions (p = 0.001, OR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64–0.89]) were significantly associated with non-response group. In conclusion, fractional CO₂ laser with topical antifungal could be a safe alternative treatment in patients with onychomycosis, who are difficult to take oral antifungals.

### Onychomycosis diagnosis and management: perspectives from a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable [^117UpkWy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other significant risk factors rise. Until recently, treatment options were limited due to safety concerns with oral antifungals and low efficacy with available topical agents. Efinaconzole and tavaborole were approved by the FDA in 2014 for onychomycosis treatment and provide additional effective topical treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Dermatologists and podiatrists both regularly treat onychomycosis, yet there are striking differences between specialties in approach to diagnosis and treatment. In order to explore these differences a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable of onychomycosis experts was convened. Although it has little effect on mycologic cure, debridement may be a valuable adjunct to oral or topical antifungal therapy, especially in patients with greater symptom burden. However, few dermatologists incorporate debridement into their treatment plans and referral to podiatry may be appropriate for some of these patients. Furthermore, podiatrists may be better equipped to manage patients with concurrent diabetes or peripheral vascular disease and elderly patients who are unable to maintain proper foot hygiene. Once cure is achieved, lifestyle and hygiene practices, maintenance/prophylactic onychomycosis treatment, and proactive tinea pedis treatment in patients and family members may help to maintain patients' cured status.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^112NihLt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2018 as a multicenter, open‐label, single‐arm study in 36 facilities nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with severe (> 50% clinical involvement) onychomycosis and the efficacy of long‐term use of EFCZ for more than 1 year. We also obtained information on patient QOL with EFCZ therapy. The study was conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects, with the approval of the appropriate ethics committee. Upon participating in the research, all the patients were given a written explanation of the study before they provided written informed consent.

Subjects

The subjects included in the study were male or female patients aged 20 years or older (at the time of informed consent) who provided written consent and were diagnosed with onychomycosis in either the left or right great toenail (target nail). The lesion should be definitely diagnosed using a potassium hydroxide examination, with 20% or more clinical involvement of the affected great toenail (not reaching the proximal nail fold), and the growth of the target nail (requiring nail clipping at least once a month) should be confirmed by consultation (regardless of the nail thickness). If both the left and right great toenails were affected, the target nail with the larger clinical involvement was selected. In case the clinical involvement was of the same size, then the right nail was chosen.

The following subjects were excluded: (i) patients with either proximal subungual onychomycosis or total dystrophic onychomycosis; (ii) patients with nail psoriasis, lichen planus of the nails, palmoplantar pustulosis of the nails, and complicated nail deformation due to causes other than onychomycosis such as dystrophia unguium; (iii) patients who received EFCZ, oral antifungals or any topical therapeutic drug for onychomycosis within 3 months before the date of informed consent; (iv) patients scheduled to use concomitant medications or combination therapies (oral antifungals, topical therapeutic medicine for onychomycosis other than EFCZ, laser irradiation, occlusive dressing therapy such as urea ointment; removal of nail thickening is allowed) during the period of participation in this study; and (v) patients with negative fungal culture (confirmed at the time of research enrollment after informed consent).

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: how to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^112Lk9vQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in QOL score at the end (or discontinuation) of treatment

The subjects assessed themselves using the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire for onychomycosis, 9, 10 and then the results were tallied and used as QOL scores. Changes in the QOL score were calculated with the following formula:

Changes in QOL score = QOL score at the end of treatment − QOL score at study baseline

The OnyCOE‐t questionnaire: Patients self‐administered the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire at the time of enrollment (baseline) and at final assessment. The OnyCOE‐t questionnaire comprised 33 items, grouped into multi‐ or single‐item scales, as follows:

A Toenail Symptom assessment, comprising both symptom frequency and symptom bothersomeness scales
An appearance problems scale
A physical activities problems scale
An overall problem scale
A stigma scale, and
A treatment satisfaction scale.

All items in the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire were transformed to a 0–100 scale; higher scores indicated better functioning.

Safety

For the subjects who had positive fungus cultures, adverse events (all developed during study participation) were assessed.

Most foot disorders do not require podiatry referral or complex interventions. After the clinical diagnosis is made, these conditions can typically be managed with over-the-counter (OTC) and home remedies, with guidance from the primary care physician. Stretching and strengthening exercises, along with the use of heel cups, resolve most plantar fasciitis cases and are at least as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid injections. Hallux rigidus is best managed with a hard-soled shoe or rigid insert that relieves pain by restricting motion across the metatarsophalangeal joint. Hallux valgus responds to use of wide toe box shoes, and surgery is not clearly beneficial beyond one year. Plantar warts can be treated effectively at home with OTC salicylic acid and cryotherapy topical agents, which have equal effectiveness to liquid nitrogen. In patients with corns and calluses, OTC topical salicylic acid has short-term benefits, and pads and inserts that more evenly redistribute contact forces have long-term benefits. Inserts are commonly recommended to redistribute forefoot pressure and relieve pain. Several OTC preparations are available for the treatment of tinea pedis, with topical allylamines being the most effective. Although OTC topical treatments have been widely used for onychomycosis, they have poor long-term cure rates compared with prescription oral medications.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^112B36bU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fungal infection of the nails accounts for 15%–40% of all nail disease and is one of the most common nail diseases in adults. The prevalence of onychomycosis increases with age and is reported to be infrequent in children. It has nevertheless been suggested that the incidence of onychomycosis in children may have increased over the last three decades. However, most studies are retrospective and based on information from medical records or laboratory data.

Pediatric onychomycosis is important to diagnose and treat for several reasons. Early detection and treatment of onychomycosis is crucial to prevent disease progression. In addition, early treatment of onychomycosis can result in higher cure rates. Mild onychomycosis can be treated topically with good clearance in children. Few antifungal therapies are licensed to onychomycosis treatment in children. Topical therapy is used as monotherapy for milder cases and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from the age of ≥ 12 years (ciclopirox), and ≥ 6 years (efinaconazole, tavaborole). Treatment with topical therapy is reported to be more effective in children than in adults, with low risk of side effects and low systemic exposure. Systemic treatment is added when the disease is more severe but has a larger risk of drug interaction and adverse events. No systemic antifungal therapy is licensed for treatment of onychomycosis in children.

The aim of this systematic review is to explore the worldwide prevalence of onychomycosis in children.

### The presence of an air gap between the nail plate and nail bed in onychomycosis patients: treatment implications for topical therapy [^116DEWF8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Transungual nail penetrance has traditionally been considered to be the only route of delivery for topical antifungals in onychomycosis. Subungual penetrance may be an alternate route of delivery.

Objective

To evaluate the ability of efinaconazole vehicle solution to reach the site of toenail onychomycosis through application to the hyponychium or hyponychium and dorsal nail surface, and assess the impact of the air gap between the nail plate and nail bed.

Methods

Twenty-three participants with moderate to severe, mycologically-confirmed onychomycosis were enrolled (mean age, 48.5 years). Two separate applications of vehicle solution containing fluorescein for visualization were applied at the hyponychium or hyponychium and dorsal nail surface. Affected nails were later clipped to allow examination of the nail bed and further examination of the ventral surface of the nail. Spread of formulation was assessed under visible and UV light conditions by photographing target toenails after vehicle application and after nail clipping.

Results

There was a positive correlation between the size of the air gap and degree of affected nail involvement (R² = 0.064). Assessments under both visible and UV light indicated that the vehicle had spread to the site of infection, with deposition of fluorescein wherever vehicle had reached, irrespective of application methodology or size of air gap. Nail clippings also indicated absorption into the ventral surface of the nail plate.

Limitations

The relative contributions of subungual versus transungual application of drug to the nail plate to the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in treating onychomycosis were not assessed.

Conclusions

This study suggests that the low surface tension vehicle developed for efinaconazole topical solution, 10% can reach the site of infection by application to the hyponychium, dorsal or ventral nail surface and nail folds. This multidirectional approach to drug delivery at the site of fungal infection may contribute to the magnitude of efficacy seen in clinical trials.

### Antifungal therapy for onychomycosis in children [^111W1gFR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic infection of the nail unit, and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults and include both oral and topical therapies. Oral agents, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have been reported to have good efficacy and a low rate of side effects in children. Topical therapies, such as amorolfine and ciclopirox, can also be used as monotherapy or combined with oral agents to treat onychomycosis. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults. There is currently insufficient data comparing emerging medical devices, such as laser therapy, with standard therapeutic options to recommend their use in children.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^111euFbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the new findings of our study is the evaluation of the complete cure rate in patients with long‐term treatment for more than 48 weeks. Severe cases have been reported to require a longer treatment duration, but the evaluation of EFCZ use for more than 48 weeks had been unclear. 15, 16 Considering that the treatment success rate increased until week 72 after starting EFCZ application, the clinical significance of continuing the application beyond 1 year was indicated. The complete cure rates at weeks 48 and 52 in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study were 20.1% and 28.8%, respectively, which were almost the same as our results of 19.6% and 26.5% at weeks 48 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the rate in our study increased to 31.1% at week 72, indicating the benefit of continuing EFCZ application for more than 1 year. In fact, 121 subjects (55.3%), more than half of the enrolled subjects, continued EFCZ application to week 72, of whom 10 achieved complete cure. Generally, the factors associated with complete cure included not only fungal infection in the nail but also the growth rate of the nail. Considering that the duration until toenails are completely replaced with new growth is mostly 1 year or even longer for elderly or thickened nails, it is not an easy goal to achieve. Nevertheless, we observed many patients who attained cure after using EFCZ for over 1 year, which suggests that more patients would achieve complete cure with longer therapy. Improvement of the mycological cure rate was observed earlier than that of the treatment success rate, reaching 50.7% at week 36 and even 55.3% at week 72. In the patient population with an affected area of more than 50%, mycological cure was obtained in 47.5% of the subjects at week 72, which is expected for high antifungal activity, even in severe cases. Mycological cure in severe cases was newly achieved even at week 72, suggesting the possible efficacy by further long‐term treatment. However, outcomes from our study are limited and thus future reports are expected.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^1163HCyH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^117BJe2v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may possibly expand the potentiality of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

On the other hand, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ; thus, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments would be considered. In fact, reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, 20, 21, 22 and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy. 23 Further studies on such cases will be expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may be currently at a turning point in the world. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Transungual delivery of efinaconazole: its deposition in the nail of onychomycosis patients and in vitro fungicidal activity in human nails [^114CDsPB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Effective transungual delivery of topical antifungal agents in onychomycosis has been hampered by poor nail permeation. To be effective they must have antifungal efficacy, and effectively permeate through the dense keratinized nail plate to the site of infection in the nail bed and nail matrix. The therapeutic efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% has been established in two phase 3 clinical trials in distal lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Objective

To investigate the transungual delivery of efinaconazole in onychomycosis patients and its fungicidal activity in the toenail.

Methods

Concentrations of efinaconazole were determined as part of a multi-center, open label study in forty onychomycosis patients following repeated application of efinaconazole topical solution, 5% and 10% to the toenails over 28 days, with a 2-week follow-up. Fungicidal activity against T. rubrum in the ventral layer of human nails was determined using an in vitro human nail infection model (ChubTur®).

Results

Efinaconazole concentrations in the nail were four orders of magnitude higher than MIC values of efinaconazole against dermatophytes. Further, nail drug concentrations were not influenced by the presence of disease or nail thickness, and maintained at high antifungal levels post-treatment. Efinaconazole was effective in reducing fungal viability, suggesting that sufficient amounts of efinaconazole were being delivered into the ventral layer of the nail plate. < BR / >

Conclusions

Effective transungual delivery of efinaconazole was demonstrated. The high efinaconazole concentrations in patient toenails and fungicidal activity in vitro potentially contribute to the clinical efficacy reported in phase 3 studies.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111hpNKT]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

(To understand fully the indication for this product, please read the entire INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the labeling.)

Ciclodan®Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program, is indicated as topical treatment in immunocompetent patients with mild to moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails without lunula involvement, due to Trichophyton rubrum. The comprehensive management program includes removal of the unattached, infected nails as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional who has special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of nail disorders, including minor nail procedures.

No studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis. Therefore, the concomitant use of 8% ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis, is not recommended.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be used only under medical supervision as described above.
The effectiveness and safety of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in the following populations has not been studied. The clinical trials with use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), excluded patients who: were pregnant or nursing, planned to become pregnant, had a history of immunosuppression (e.g., extensive, persistent, or unusual distribution of dermatomycoses, extensive seborrheic dermatitis, recent or recurring herpes zoster, or persistent herpes simplex), were HIV seropositive, received organ transplant, required medication to control epilepsy, were insulin dependent diabetics or had diabetic neuropathy. Patients with severe plantar (moccasin) tinea pedis were also excluded.
The safety and efficacy of using Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), daily for greater than 48 weeks have not been established.

### Efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate, a novel oral triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of onychomycosis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^111AVDyZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Subjects

The main inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (i) 20 years or older but less than 75 years of age; (ii) clinical involvement in either the left or right great toenail; (iii) positive potassium hydroxide examination results under direct microscopy and confirmed detection of Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes by loop‐mediated isothermal amplification, a method proven to have a high correlation with fungal culture in identification of T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes, prior to this study (Dr Shinichi Watanabe, 2013, unpubl. data); (iv) clinical involvement affecting 25% or more of the toenail; and (v) the provision of written informed consent.

The main exclusion criteria applied to patients were as follows: (i) use of any oral or injectable antifungal agent or topical antifungal agent for nails within 36 weeks before the first administration of the study drug; (ii) longitudinal streaks or a spike in the toenail with clinical involvement to be evaluated (target toenail); (iii) clinical involvement reaching the proximal nail fold of the target toenail; (iv) dermatophytes detected only on the nail surface (superficial white onychomycosis); or (v) significant nail thickening or deformity due to onychogryphosis or other conditions.

During the study period, subjects were prohibited from using any oral or topical antifungal agent other than the study drug, or other therapies for onychomycosis such as surgical removal of an affected nail. No drugs were prohibited from concomitant use from the viewpoint of drug interactions. Subjects with a post‐baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level exceeding 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range of the clinical laboratory values were to be prematurely withdrawn from the study.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^114Sn8RQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients ages 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected 1 year after completion of the study from 24 patients. Mycologic cure, effective treatment, and complete cure were assessed, as well as adverse events and effect on quality of life. Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for 1 year remained clear. Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Drug synergies and the potential for combination therapy in onychomycosis [^115R2qjp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Synergy between antifungal drugs is well recognized. However, combinations of antifungals are yet to be widely adopted to treat onychomycosis. The rationale for the combination of topical and oral therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis is that the systemic antifungal reaches the infection area via the nail bed and the topical agent is absorbed through the nail surface. The combination of antifungals used should ideally be synergistic in their mode of action. Synergy between amorolfine and other antifungals has been demonstrated in vitro. This is presumably due to differences in the precise point of action of the drugs on the fungal cell membrane, where they inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol. Thus, combinations can result in increased antifungal activity at lower concentrations of both drugs. The potential exists therefore for combinations of antifungals to achieve higher cure rates in onychomycosis, in a shorter time than is currently possible. This approach warrants further investigation.

### Onychomycosis in children: safety and efficacy of antifungal agents [^113YmsQX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is an uncommon condition in childhood, but prevalence in children is increasing worldwide. The objective was to review the efficacy and safety of systemic and topical antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis in children. Databases (Pubmed, OVID, Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched. Seven studies were selected for inclusion. Only one was a randomized controlled trial. In total, 208 children were administered antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis. Four reports of mild adverse events were documented (1.9% of treated children), one of which discontinued treatment (0.5%). Limitations of this review are the lack of randomized controlled trials available in pediatric onychomycosis. These findings suggest that antifungal therapies used to treat onychomycosis in children are associated with a low incidence of adverse events. Current dosing regimens for antifungal drugs are effective and appear safe to use in children, notwithstanding that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of these agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. To our knowledge, this review is the most up-to-date, comprehensive summary of pediatric onychomycosis treatment.

### Topical and device-based treatment of toenail onychomycosis… [^1145rgCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are topical and device-based therapies safe and effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antifungal drugs, including efinaconazole 10% solution, tavaborole 5% solution, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer and hydrolacquer, are beneficial in treating mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis. 1, 2 Potential adverse effects are mild and include dermatitis and vesicles.

1. This Cochrane review included 56 randomized controlled trials involving 12, 501 participants. Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated that efinaconazole 10% solution produced mycologic cure. In two studies involving 1, 198 participants, tavaborole 5% solution was superior to placebo at achieving mycologic cure and complete cure. When compared with ciclopirox 8% lacquer and amorolfine 5% lacquer, ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer was more effective at achieving complete cure. However, there was no difference between these treatments in mycologic cure or risk of adverse effects, including erythema, rash, and burning. 1 Current clinical practice guidelines recommend using oral antifungal agents as first-line treatment for onychomycosis; however, this may not be feasible for patients with limited access to care, potential drug interactions, contraindications to oral therapy, or a preference for topical treatment. 4, 5 Of note, oral terbinafine costs the same as or less than topical agents. 6.

### Topical antifungals for treatment of onychomycosis… [^112oS5w4]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the rate of resolution of onychomycosis treated with topical antifungal agents. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antifungal agents are effective in treating onychomycosis, with a number needed to treat of 7 to 17. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution achieved complete cure rates of 15% to 18% vs.
3. 3% to 5. 5% for vehicle. Tavaborole 5% topical solution achieved complete cure rates of 6. 5% to
9. 1% vs.
0. 5% to

1. 5% for vehicle. Ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer achieved a complete cure rate of 7% compared with 1% for vehicle. Each medication must be used daily for 48 weeks. 2 Patients 18 years and older were randomized to receive tavaborole or vehicle once daily for 48 weeks.

Effectiveness and safety were assessed at baseline, week 2, week 6, and every six weeks thereafter until week 48, with final evaluation at week 52. Tavaborole was significantly more effective than vehicle alone when applied daily for 48 weeks. Rates of completely clear or almost clear nails with negative mycology were also significantly greater in the treatment group. Adverse effects were limited to local site reactions, such as exfoliation, erythema, and dermatitis. A 2000 pooled study of two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center trials evaluated ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer in the treatment of distal subungual onychomycosis. 3 Rates of complete cure were greater with ciclopirox compared with vehicle.

Mild transient irritation at the application site was the most common adverse effect.

### Terbinafine and itraconazole are most effective for toenail… [^1158UuSy]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the preferred monotherapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Bottom Line For toenail onychomycosis, continuous terbinafine, 250 mg, and continuous itraconazole, 200 mg, for 12 to 24 weeks are the preferred therapies. The included studies had a total of 8, 136 patients and reported eight treatment regimens, including some with the same drug given continuously or in a pulsed fashion. Most studies treated patients for 12 to 24 weeks, and the study drugs included ciclopirox 8% solution, efinaconazole 10% solution, fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, and tavaborole 5% solution. The researchers used conventional methods for data abstraction, quality assessment, and analysis. Of the 31 trials, only five were judged to be at overall low risk of bias.

Most studies failed to describe randomization procedures or allocation concealment, 52% failed to mask participants, and 64% failed to mask outcome assessors. Itraconazole, 200 mg, and terbinafine, 250 mg, were most effective, based on placebo-controlled trials. Continuous regimens were more effective than pulsed regimens. This is consistent with the results based on direct and indirect comparisons. Continuous terbinafine and continuous itraconazole were most likely to be effective for mycologic cure. Adverse events did not differ much among the drugs; itraconazole was the safest.
