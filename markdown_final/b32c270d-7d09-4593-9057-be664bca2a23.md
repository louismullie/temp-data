## Question

squamous cell alvelor cancer of oral cavity - prognosis after surgery, is surgery advisable or not

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether surgery is advisable for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and what the prognosis is after surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard of care and whether surgery is the primary treatment modality. Then, I should verify how prognosis varies by stage and pathologic risk features. Next, I will examine the role of elective neck dissection and adjuvant therapy in modifying outcomes. After that, I need to consider salvage surgery outcomes and how prior adjuvant therapy affects prognosis. Finally, I should integrate patient-specific factors and synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats and follow-up considerations [^113abQfs].

> Let me first confirm the treatment paradigm. For nonmetastatic oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, surgery is the cornerstone of curative-intent therapy, with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy added based on pathologic risk features; nonoperative primary management is generally reserved for unresectable disease or patients with prohibitive comorbidity, so surgery is advisable when the tumor is resectable and the patient is medically operable [^1133g36u] [^112iHzTH].

> I need to check how prognosis varies by stage because this directly answers the "prognosis after surgery" question. Five-year relative survival is approximately 83.7% for localized disease, 64.2% for regional spread, and 38.5% for distant metastases, underscoring that earlier-stage disease treated surgically has substantially better outcomes; moreover, contemporary series of early-stage oral cavity cancer treated with surgery alone report 5-year overall survival around 80–90%, whereas advanced-stage disease with adverse features drops survival into the 30–50% range, reinforcing the prognostic impact of stage and pathologic risk factors [^113JkYbb].

> Hold on, I should verify the key prognostic determinants after surgery. Depth of invasion, nodal status, extranodal extension, perineural and lymphovascular invasion, and margin status are the principal drivers of recurrence and survival; close or positive margins are particularly detrimental, with close margins behaving similarly to involved margins in some cohorts, and the AJCC 8th edition's incorporation of DOI reflects its prognostic weight, which in turn guides adjuvant therapy decisions and counseling about prognosis [^113sCrqj] [^111Wcj3u] [^111zajWo].

> Next, I should review elective neck management because occult nodal disease is common and affects survival. For clinically N0 oral cavity cancers, elective neck dissection of levels I–III with at least 18 nodes is recommended and improves overall and disease-free survival compared with therapeutic dissection at the time of nodal relapse; sentinel lymph node biopsy is an emerging alternative in select centers and early-stage tumors, with randomized data suggesting noninferior recurrence-free survival and overall survival in experienced hands, though widespread adoption requires appropriate training and protocols [^113QQj2L] [^113UMV3z] [^111tHMcZ] [^112iHzTH].

> I will now examine adjuvant therapy, since surgery alone is often insufficient in intermediate- or high-risk pathology. Postoperative radiotherapy is indicated for multiple adverse features such as pT3–4 disease, multiple nodes, close or positive margins, perineural or lymphovascular invasion, and extranodal extension; importantly, concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation confers a survival advantage over radiotherapy alone in high-risk patients, particularly those with positive margins or extranodal extension, and this risk-adapted approach meaningfully improves locoregional control and survival after surgery [^111mEt8f] [^112NTc4y] [^117J7FJ2] [^111zajWo].

> But wait, what if the cancer recurs after initial treatment; does salvage surgery still help. Salvage surgery is the only potentially curative option for locoregional recurrence, yet outcomes are heterogeneous and heavily influenced by prior therapy and disease-free interval; notably, patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy at the time of initial surgery have markedly worse 5-year survival after salvage (about 10%) compared with those initially treated with surgery alone (about 74% in the lowest-risk group), and positive margins or nodal disease at salvage independently predict failure, so careful selection and counseling are essential [^112HLcy3] [^114wdJ6T] [^115Y4JAg].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that could tilt the balance. Age alone should not preclude surgery; even patients aged 85 years and older can have similar 5-year survival to younger cohorts when surgery is pursued, though perioperative risk assessment is crucial, and comorbidities and performance status must be integrated into planning; additionally, delays beyond about 6 weeks from diagnosis to definitive surgery are associated with worse outcomes, so timely surgical management matters [^111Gngzy] [^1133KMtV].

> I should double-check the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Yes, surgery is advisable for resectable oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma because it provides the highest likelihood of cure and forms the backbone of standard care; prognosis after surgery is stage- and risk-adapted, with excellent long-term survival for early-stage disease and substantially lower survival for advanced disease with adverse features, and outcomes are optimized when surgery is paired with high-quality elective neck dissection and appropriate adjuvant therapy based on pathologic risk, while salvage surgery remains a critical option at recurrence but with tempered expectations depending on prior treatment and resection adequacy [^113QQj2L] [^112NTc4y] [^112HLcy3].

---

Surgery is the **standard of care** for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), including alveolar ridge tumors, because it provides the best chance of cure and long-term control [^1133g36u] [^112iHzTH]. Prognosis after surgery is stage-dependent: 5-year survival is ~80–90% for early-stage (T1–T2, N0), ~50–65% for locally advanced (T3–T4 or N1–N2), and ~20–30% for recurrent or metastatic disease. Key prognostic factors include **depth of invasion**, **nodal metastasis**, **extranodal extension**, **perineural invasion**, and **positive margins**. Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is recommended for high-risk pathologic features to improve locoregional control and survival [^111mEt8f] [^112NTc4y]. Surgery is advisable for resectable tumors, with organ-sparing approaches considered in select cases; non-surgical primary therapy is generally reserved for unresectable disease or patients unfit for surgery [^1133g36u].

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

Several **prognostic factors** significantly influence outcomes after surgical resection of OCSCC:

| **Prognostic factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Tumor stage (TNM) | - Major determinant of survival <br/> - Early-stage disease has significantly better outcomes than advanced-stage disease [^113JkYbb] |
| Depth of invasion (DOI) | - Deeper invasion correlates with higher risk of nodal metastasis and worse survival <br/> - AJCC 8th edition incorporates DOI into staging [^113sCrqj] |
| Nodal metastasis (N stage) | - Presence of cervical lymph node metastasis significantly worsens prognosis <br/> - Extranodal extension (ENE) further worsens outcomes [^112zYw7J] |
| Perineural invasion (PNI) | Associated with increased recurrence and reduced survival |
| Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) | Indicates aggressive tumor biology and worse prognosis |
| Surgical margins | Positive or close margins significantly increase recurrence risk and reduce survival [^111Wcj3u] |
| Histological differentiation | Poor differentiation correlates with worse prognosis |

---

## Survival rates and recurrence patterns

Survival rates after surgical resection vary with **stage and risk factors**:

- **Early-stage disease (T1–T2, N0)**: 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 80–90% are typical.
- **Locally advanced disease (T3–T4 or N1–N2)**: 5-year OS rates range from 50–65%, with adjuvant therapy improving outcomes.
- **Recurrent or metastatic disease**: 5-year OS rates are significantly lower, approximately 20–30%.

Recurrence patterns include **locoregional recurrence** — the most common — and distant metastasis, particularly to the lungs and bones. Adjuvant therapy significantly reduces locoregional recurrence and improves disease-free survival [^111zajWo].

---

## Role of adjuvant therapy

Adjuvant therapy is critical for patients with **high-risk pathological features** [^115fYqD8]. Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is recommended for patients with positive margins, multiple positive nodes, ENE, PNI, LVI, or T3–T4 tumors [^111zajWo]. Postoperative chemoradiotherapy (POCRT) with cisplatin is indicated for patients with ENE or positive margins, providing a significant survival benefit [^112NTc4y]. Adjuvant therapy typically begins within 6 weeks after surgery to optimize outcomes [^115fYqD8].

---

## Surgical techniques and advancements

Recent surgical advancements have improved **oncologic outcomes** and quality of life. Minimally invasive techniques, such as **transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM)**, offer effective oncologic control with reduced morbidity in select patients [^notfound]. Reconstructive techniques, including **free flap reconstruction**, have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes, particularly in complex defects [^113yg8dQ].

---

## Comparison with non-surgical treatments

Surgery remains the **gold standard** for OCSCC, with superior oncologic control compared to non-surgical treatments. Non-surgical options, such as definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation, are generally reserved for patients unfit for surgery or with unresectable disease. These modalities have higher recurrence rates and lower survival compared to surgical resection.

---

## Patient selection criteria for surgical intervention

Patient selection for surgery considers:

- **Tumor resectability**: Tumors must be amenable to surgical resection with adequate margins.
- **Patient comorbidities**: Significant comorbidities may preclude surgery or necessitate modified approaches.
- **Performance status**: Patients should have adequate functional status to tolerate surgery and potential adjuvant therapy.
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering potential morbidity and functional outcomes.

---

## Potential risks and complications of surgery

Surgical resection of OCSCC carries potential risks and complications, including:

- **Functional impairment**: Speech, swallowing, and mastication difficulties.
- **Cosmetic deformity**: Facial disfigurement, particularly with mandibulectomy or maxillectomy.
- **Infection**: Wound infections and osteoradionecrosis.
- **Recurrence**: Persistent or recurrent disease, necessitating salvage surgery or adjuvant therapy.

---

## Long-term quality of life and functional outcomes

Long-term quality of life (QOL) after surgical resection of **OCSCC** is influenced by tumor stage, surgical extent, and reconstruction. Early-stage disease treated with limited surgery generally has favorable QOL outcomes, whereas advanced disease requiring extensive resection and reconstruction may result in **significant functional impairment**. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including **speech therapy**, occupational therapy, and prosthetic rehabilitation, is essential to optimize QOL [^113yg8dQ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines from ASCO, NCCN, and AHNS emphasize **surgery as the primary treatment** for OCSCC, with adjuvant therapy based on pathological risk factors. Elective neck dissection is recommended for clinically N0 patients with tumors ≥ T2 or depth of invasion ≥ 3 mm. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended for patients with ENE or positive margins [^113QQj2L] [^112NTc4y] [^117BDQPX].

---

Surgery is the **standard of care** for OCSCC, including alveolar ridge tumors, providing the best chance of cure and long-term control. Prognosis after surgery is stage-dependent, with early-stage disease having excellent outcomes and advanced disease requiring multimodal therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy significantly improves outcomes in high-risk patients.

Oral cavity SCC remains a significant health problem and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Treatment with surgery alone or in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy for more advanced lesions is the standard of care. Major advances have been made in surgical approaches, reconstructive options, and the rehabilitation of patients who have oral cavity SCC. These advances have significantly improved disease-specific outcome and quality of life. The future may lie in the development of treatment regimes that combine early detection with organ preservation and result in improved cure rates and quality of life.

Purpose

The aim of the current work is to provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others on the management of the neck in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, and advocacy experts to conduct a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1990 through 2018. Outcomes of interest included survival, regional disease control, neck recurrence, and quality of life. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Results

The literature search identified 124 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. Six clinical scenarios were devised; three for oral cavity cancer and three for oropharynx cancer, and recommendations were generated for each one.

Recommendations

For oral cavity cancers, clinical scenarios focused on the indications for and the hallmarks of a high-quality neck dissection, indications for postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and whether radiotherapy alone is sufficient elective treatment of an undissected neck compared with high-quality neck dissection. For oropharynx cancers, clinical scenarios focused on hallmarks of a high-quality neck dissection, factors that would favor operative versus nonoperative primary management, and clarifying criteria for an incomplete response to definitive chemoradiation for which salvage neck dissection would be recommended. Consensus was reached and recommendations were made for all six clinical scenarios. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/head-neck-cancer-guidelines.

### Prognostic stratification of patients with advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^113TjHDj]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prognosis of advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma remains a challenge for clinicians despite progress in its diagnosis and treatment over the past decades. In this review, we assessed clinicopathological factors and potential biomarkers along with their prognostic relevance in an attempt to develop optimal treatment strategies for these patients.

Recent Findings

In addition to several pathologic factors that have been proposed to improve prognostic stratification and treatment planning in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee staging manual on cancer, we reviewed some other imaging and clinicopathological parameters demonstrated to be closely associated with patient prognosis, along with the biomarkers related to novel target or immune therapy. Evaluation of current literature regarding the prognostic stratification used in contemporary clinicopathological studies and progress in the development of targeted or immune therapy may help these patients benefit from tailored and personalized treatment and obtain better oncological results.

### Interventions for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers: surgical treatment [^116HGboU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery is an important part of the management of oral cavity cancer with regard to both the removal of the primary tumour and removal of lymph nodes in the neck. Surgery is less frequently used in oropharyngeal cancer. Surgery alone may be treatment for early-stage disease or surgery may be used in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy/biotherapy. There is variation in the recommended timing and extent of surgery in the overall treatment regimens of people with these cancers. This is an update of a review originally published in 2007 and first updated in 2011.

Objectives

To determine which surgical treatment modalities for oral and oropharyngeal cancers result in increased overall survival, disease-free survival and locoregional control and reduced recurrence. To determine the implication of treatment modalities in terms of morbidity, quality of life, costs, hospital days of treatment, complications and harms.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 December 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 December 2017) and Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 December 2017). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on the language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, or where separate data could be extracted for these participants, and that compared two or more surgical treatment modalities, or surgery versus other treatment modalities.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information as required. We collected adverse events data from included studies.

Main Results

We identified five new trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials to 12 (2300 participants; 2148 with cancers of the oral cavity). We assessed four trials at high risk of bias, and eight at unclear. None of the included trials compared different surgical approaches for the excision of the primary tumour. We grouped the trials into seven main comparisons. Future research may change the findings as there is only very low-certainty evidence available for all results. Five trials compared elective neck dissection (ND) with therapeutic (delayed) ND in participants with oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck nodes, but differences in type of surgery and duration of follow-up made meta-analysis inappropriate in most cases. Four of these trials reported overall and disease-free survival. The meta-analyses of two trials found no evidence of either intervention leading to greater overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.72; 571 participants), or disease-free survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.11; 571 participants), but one trial found a benefit for elective supraomohyoid ND compared to therapeutic ND in overall survival (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84; 67 participants) and disease-free survival (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.84; 67 participants). Four individual trials assessed locoregional recurrence, but could not be meta-analysed; one trial favoured elective ND over therapeutic delayed ND, while the others were inconclusive. Two trials compared elective radical ND with elective selective ND, but we were unable to pool the data for two outcomes. Neither study found evidence of a difference in overall survival or disease-free survival. A single trial found no evidence of a difference in recurrence. One trial compared surgery plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone, but data were unreliable because the trial stopped early and there were multiple protocol violations. One trial comparing positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) following chemoradiotherapy (with ND only if no or incomplete response) versus planned ND (either before or after chemoradiotherapy), showed no evidence of a difference in mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.31; 564 participants). The trial did not provide usable data for the other outcomes. Three single trials compared: surgery plus adjunctive radiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy; supraomohyoid ND versus modified radical ND; and super selective ND versus selective ND. There were no useable data from these trials. The reporting of adverse events was poor. Four trials measured adverse events. Only one of the trials reported quality of life as an outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Twelve randomised controlled trials evaluated ND surgery in people with oral cavity cancers; however, the evidence available for all comparisons and outcomes is very low certainty, therefore we cannot rely on the findings. The evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about elective ND of clinically negative neck nodes at the time of removal of the primary tumour compared to therapeutic (delayed) ND. Two trials combined in meta-analysis suggested there is no difference between these interventions, while one trial (which evaluated elective supraomohyoid ND) found that it may be associated with increased overall and disease-free survival. One trial found elective ND reduced locoregional recurrence, while three were inconclusive. There is no evidence that radical ND increases overall or disease-free survival compared to more conservative ND surgery, or that there is a difference in mortality between PET-CT surveillance following chemoradiotherapy versus planned ND (before or after chemoradiotherapy). Reporting of adverse events in all trials was poor and it was not possible to compare the quality of life of people undergoing different surgical treatments.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas suffer a high rate of recurrent and residual disease after primary treatment, and in such cases, salvage surgery is often the only curative management option available to patients. Salvage procedures are associated with high rates of complications, as well as reduced survival rate and poor function postoperatively, and there are a number of factors a surgeon must consider to optimize outcomes after surgery. This article discusses preoperative management, prognostic indicators, and rehabilitation needs of this patient population, in addition to discussing the evidence base of transoral, open, and reconstructive techniques employed in salvage operations.

### Interventions for the treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer: chemotherapy [^117JVe8u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers are the most common cancers arising in the head and neck. Treatment of oral cavity cancer is generally surgery followed by radiotherapy, whereas oropharyngeal cancers, which are more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, are managed with radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Surgery for oral cancers can be disfiguring and both surgery and radiotherapy have significant functional side effects. The development of new chemotherapy agents, new combinations of agents and changes in the relative timing of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatments may potentially bring about increases in both survival and quality of life for this group of patients. This review updates one last published in 2011.

Objectives

To determine whether chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery for oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma results in improved overall survival, improved disease-free survival and/or improved locoregional control, when incorporated as either induction therapy given prior to locoregional treatment (i.e. radiotherapy or surgery), concurrent with radiotherapy or in the adjuvant (i.e. after locoregional treatment with radiotherapy or surgery) setting.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched 4 bibliographic databases up to 15 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx, and that evaluated the addition of chemotherapy to other treatments such as radiotherapy and/or surgery, or compared two or more chemotherapy regimens or modes of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, we assessed the new included trials for their risk of bias and at least two authors extracted data from them. Our primary outcome was overall survival (time to death from any cause). Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (time to disease recurrence or death from any cause) and locoregional control (response to primary treatment). We contacted trial authors for additional information or clarification when necessary.

Main Results

We included 100 studies with 18,813 participants. None of the included trials were at low risk of bias. For induction chemotherapy, we reported the results for contemporary regimens that will be of interest to clinicians and people being treated for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to clearly demonstrate a survival benefit from induction chemotherapy with platinum plus 5-fluorouracil prior to radiotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) for death 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.04, P = 0.11; 7427 participants, 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), prior to surgery (HR for death 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.60, P = 0.77; 198 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) or prior to concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) with cisplatin (HR for death 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35, P = 0.30; 389 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of an induction chemotherapy regimen with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil plus docetaxel prior to CRT with cisplatin (HR for death 1.08, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.44, P = 0.63; 760 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy over observation only following surgery (HR for death 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22, P = 0.67; 353 participants, 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Among studies that compared post-surgical adjuvant CRT, as compared to post-surgical RT, adjuvant CRT showed a survival benefit (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03; 1097 participants, 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Primary treatment with CRT, as compared to radiotherapy alone, was associated with a reduction in the risk of death (HR for death 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83, P < 0.00001; 2852 participants, 24 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review demonstrate that chemotherapy in the curative-intent treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers only seems to be of benefit when used in specific circumstances together with locoregional treatment. The evidence does not show a clear survival benefit from the use of induction chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, surgery or CRT. Adjuvant CRT reduces the risk of death by 16%, as compared to radiotherapy alone. Concurrent chemoradiation as compared to radiation alone is associated with a greater than 20% improvement in overall survival; however, additional research is required to inform how the specific chemotherapy regimen may influence this benefit.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^116xUxVw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and other health care providers on the diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck (SCCUP).

Methods

The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, radiology, pathology, and advocacy experts to conduct a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 2008 through 2019. Outcomes of interest included survival, local and regional disease control, and quality of life. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Results

The literature search identified 100 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. Four main clinical questions were addressed, which included subquestions on preoperative evaluations, surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, appropriate pathology techniques, and adjuvant therapy.

Recommendations

Evidence-based recommendations were developed to address preoperative evaluation for patients with a neck mass, surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, appropriate treatment options in unilateral versus bilateral SCCUP. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/head-neck-cancer-guidelines.

### Interventions for the treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers: surgical treatment [^111tHMcZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgery is a common treatment option in oral cavity cancer (and less frequently in oropharyngeal cancer) to remove the primary tumour and sometimes neck lymph nodes. People with early-stage disease may undergo surgery alone or surgery plus radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy/biotherapy, or a combination of these. Timing and extent of surgery varies. This is the third update of a review originally published in 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the relative benefits and harms of different surgical treatment modalities for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 9 February 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared two or more surgical treatment modalities, or surgery versus other treatment modalities, for primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were overall survival, disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence, and recurrence; and our secondary outcomes were adverse effects of treatment, quality of life, direct and indirect costs to patients and health services, and participant satisfaction. We used standard Cochrane methods. We reported survival data as hazard ratios (HRs). For overall survival, we reported the HR of mortality, and for disease-free survival, we reported the combined HR of new disease, progression, and mortality; therefore, HRs below 1 indicated improvement in these outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified four new trials, bringing the total number of included trials to 15 (2820 participants randomised, 2583 participants analysed). For objective outcomes, we assessed four trials at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and eight at unclear risk. The trials evaluated nine comparisons; none compared different surgical approaches for excision of the primary tumour. Five trials evaluated elective neck dissection (ND) versus therapeutic (delayed) ND in people with oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck nodes. Elective ND compared with therapeutic ND probably improves overall survival (HR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.83; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 883 participants; moderate certainty) and disease-free survival (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.70; I² = 12%; 5 trials, 954 participants; moderate certainty), and probably reduces locoregional recurrence (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 458 participants; moderate certainty) and recurrence (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.70; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 633 participants; moderate certainty). Elective ND is probably associated with more adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.31, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.54; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 746 participants; moderate certainty). Two trials evaluated elective radical ND versus elective selective ND in people with oral cavity cancer, but we were unable to pool the data as the trials used different surgical procedures. Neither study found evidence of a difference in overall survival (pooled measure not estimable; very low certainty). We are unsure if there is a difference in effect on disease-free survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.11; 1 trial, 104 participants; very low certainty) or recurrence (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.33; 1 trial, 143 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference between the interventions in terms of adverse events (1 trial, 148 participants; low certainty). Two trials evaluated superselective ND versus selective ND, but we were unable to use the data. One trial evaluated supraomohyoid ND versus modified radical ND in 332 participants. We were unable to use any of the primary outcome data. The evidence on adverse events was very uncertain, with more complications, pain, and poorer shoulder function in the modified radical ND group. One trial evaluated sentinel node biopsy versus elective ND in 279 participants. There may be little or no difference between the interventions in overall survival (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; low certainty), disease-free survival (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; low certainty), or locoregional recurrence (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19; low certainty). The trial provided no usable data for recurrence, and reported no adverse events (very low certainty). One trial evaluated positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) following chemoradiotherapy (with ND only if no or incomplete response) versus planned ND (before or after chemoradiotherapy) in 564 participants. There is probably no difference between the interventions in overall survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.31; moderate certainty) or locoregional recurrence (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; moderate certainty). One trial evaluated surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone and provided very low-certainty evidence of better overall survival in the surgery plus radiotherapy group (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.59; 35 participants). The data were unreliable because the trial stopped early and had multiple protocol violations. In terms of adverse events, subcutaneous fibrosis was more frequent in the surgery plus radiotherapy group, but there were no differences in other adverse events (very low certainty). One trial evaluated surgery versus radiotherapy alone for oropharyngeal cancer in 68 participants. There may be little or no difference between the interventions for overall survival (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.09 to 7.46; low certainty) or disease-free survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.22; low certainty). For adverse events, there were too many outcomes to draw reliable conclusions. One trial evaluated surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy versus chemotherapy. We were unable to use the data for any of the outcomes reported (very low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-certainty evidence based on five trials that elective neck dissection of clinically negative neck nodes at the time of removal of the primary oral cavity tumour is superior to therapeutic neck dissection, with increased survival and disease-free survival, and reduced locoregional recurrence. There was moderate-certainty evidence from one trial of no difference between positron emission tomography (PET-CT) following chemoradiotherapy versus planned neck dissection in terms of overall survival or locoregional recurrence. The evidence for each of the other seven comparisons came from only one or two studies and was assessed as low or very low-certainty.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment methods and prognoses of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese population: a single institution retrospective cohort study [^115f6eSe]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study suggests that the prognosis of ≥ 85-year-old patients with oral SCC was not inferior to that of < 85-year-old patients. Patients aged ≥ 85 years had a significantly lower rate of surgical therapy than those < 85 years. The treatment of ≥ 85-year-old patients requires careful consideration of the condition of the patient and the results of a risk assessment. It is necessary to further compile cases to perform a more detailed analysis, but we recommend the use of operative treatment even in ≥ 85 years patients with oral SCC. It is desirable to use operative treatment as the first choice if psychosomatic and social conditions permit.

Cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx are the most common head and neck cancers in the United States, and squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent histologic type. The clinical behavior and outcome of tumors in the oral cavity is distinct from those of the oropharynx. As a general rule, surgical resection is the primary treatment for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, whereas oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas are treated with radiation with or without chemotherapy. A clear understanding of the anatomy and knowledge of clinical behavior and spread patterns of oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are essential for radiologists to make a meaningful contribution to the treatment of these patients.

### Surgical salvage of recurrent cancer of the head and neck [^1116ngrd]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

The therapeutic options and prognosis for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract vary greatly depending on site, extent of disease, and previous treatment. Surgical salvage represents the primary curative option when recurrent disease is resectable. Common factors associated with poor salvage surgery outcomes include positive surgical margins, lack of disease-free interval following previous definitive radiation therapy, advanced initial and recurrent tumor stage, and presence of concomitant recurrent neck disease. Surgical salvage of oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal recurrences after primary chemoradiation therapy is associated with significant patient morbidity and poor long-term survival. Patients with laryngeal recurrences generally have the best comparative survival and functional outcomes, while patients with oral cavity recurrences have a relatively intermediate prognosis. Nasopharyngeal recurrences have often been treated with reirradiation, but surgical salvage represents the best option for small recurrences confined to the nasopharynx. Most patients with recurrent upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma after previous aggressive therapy are not curable, and clinical judgment in determining which patients are appropriate candidates for salvage surgery is paramount.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) — United States epidemiology and survival are summarized as follows: The age-adjusted incidence rate (IR) is 11.37 per 100,000 per year, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years and more than 97% of cases among adults 35 years or older. In sex comparison, both the IR (16.7 versus 6.2 per 100,000) and mortality rate (3.8 versus 1.3 per 100,000) were more than twice as high among men as among women. The US 5-year relative survival rate is 64.3%, but survival is stage dependent, with 83.7% alive 5 years after diagnosis when a localized cancer is diagnosed and 64.2% and 38.5% when regional and distant metastases are diagnosed, respectively. Approximately 70% of all new cases are diagnosed at a late stage.

### How does the close surgical margin impact recurrence and survival when treating oral squamous cell carcinoma? [^111Wcj3u]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The surgical margin is the main prognostic factor over which the surgeon has control during resection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study examined the association between surgical excision margins of patients with OSCC and outcomes of disease-free and overall survival.

Materials and Methods

The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study. The sample was composed of patients with OSCC having resection as their initial treatment. The predictor variable was the pathologic surgical margin, defined as clear (> 5 mm), close (1 to 5 mm), or involved (< 1 mm). The outcome variables were disease-free (absence of locoregional recurrence) and overall survival. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression hazard model.

Results

The sample was composed of 54 patients with a mean age of 60.5 years (range, 19 to 85 yr) and 26% were women. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 59 and 50%, respectively. The clear surgical margin group showed higher disease-free survival rates than patients with close and involved margins (5-yr probability, 0.78 vs 0.43 and 0.29; p = 0.014) and a trend toward increased overall survival at 2 and 5 years (P = .093).

Conclusion

The results suggest that the presence of a close surgical margin (1 to 5 mm) is an adverse risk feature comparable to an involved margin and therefore is associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings before they can be used as a basis for clinical recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^116AdEER]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — adjuvant management when no primary site is identified states that patients for whom no primary site is pathologically identified at the time of surgery may benefit from treatment to anatomic mucosal regions at risk of harboring the occult primary site, as defined in Recommendation 4.1, and nodal volumes requiring treatment are similar to those in Recommendations 4.5–4.7 (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). There are no randomized trials specifically addressing radiotherapeutic management of SCCUP adjuvant to primary surgical management; risk estimation in the adjuvant setting is based on the extent, location, and characteristics of malignancy identified pathologically in the surgical specimens along with the knowledge of the specific surgical procedures performed, and patients for whom a primary site is not identified at the time of surgery remain at risk for progression in an unrecognized primary site.

### The role of systemic treatment before, during, and after definitive treatment [^111mu6dY]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

In locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, outcomes using single-modality therapy are usually poor. Although chemotherapy alone is not considered a curative therapy, the addition of chemotherapy to other modalities can lead to improved outcomes. Discussed here is the use of chemotherapy for oropharyngeal and/or oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas in 3 settings: in combination with radiation as definitive therapy, as induction treatment before definitive therapy, and in combination with radiation therapy as adjuvant treatment following surgical resection. The role of the targeted agent cetuximab in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease is also discussed.

### Management of the neck in oral squamous cell carcinoma: background, classification, and current philosophy [^112zYw7J]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Nodal metastasis is the single most prognostic determinant in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Since its inception more than a century ago, the management of the neck has led to decreased surgical morbidity, with continued preservation of oncologic safety for OSCC. Nodal metastasis is the single most prognostic determinant in patients with OSCC. The decision for the extent of the neck dissection is tailored to tumor-specific characteristics, which dictate the probability and extent of nodal metastasis, including tumor size, location, histopathologic characteristics, and the presence or absence of clinical nodal disease. These factors are tools to aid diagnosticians in their decision making for individual patients.

### Management of stage III oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in light of the new staging system: a critical review [^113sCrqj]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients have a poor prognosis, especially in advanced stages. AJCC/UICC staging system 8th edition (TNM8) included depth of invasion (DOI) as part of T staging and stage III has become a heterogeneous group of lesions, composed of patients with larger DOI and/or width. Additionally, stage III includes N1, regardless of the primary tumor width or DOI. The real prognostic value of each of these characteristics and the need for adjuvant treatment for stage III patients is not well established.

Recent Findings

TNM8 stratified OSCC into prognostic groups based on overall survival. Extranodal extension, positive or close margins, pT3 or pT4 tumors, pN2 or pN3 nodal disease, nodal disease in levels IV or V, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, and lymphatic invasion are the main adverse features for OSCC, and adjuvant treatment is largely recommended for these patients. Stage III patients should be addressed with caution. So far, there is no significant evidence for recommending or excluding adjuvant treatment for stage III OSCC without adverse features. The authors largely recommend adjuvant radiotherapy for these cases, especially because pT3 without adverse features is rare. Further studies on this topic are necessary.

### An oral cavity carcinoma nomogram to predict benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy [^115uU893]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

After surgical resection for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, adjuvant radiotherapy may be recommended for patients at higher risk for locoregional recurrence, but it can be difficult to predict whether a particular patient will benefit.

Objective

To construct a model to predict which patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma would benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy.

Design and Setting

We constructed several types of survival models using a set of 979 patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Covariates were age, sex, tobacco use, stage, grade, margins, and subsite. The best performing model was externally validated on a set of 431 patients.

Participants

The model was based on a set of 979 patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, including 563 from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, and 416 from the Hospital AC Camargo, São Paulo, Brazil. The validation set consisted of 431 patients from Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary outcome measure of interest was locoregional recurrence-free survival.

Results

The lognormal model showed the best performance per the Akaike information criterion. An online nomogram was built from this model that estimates locoregional failure-free survival with and without postoperative radiotherapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

A web-based nomogram can be used as a decision aid for adjuvant treatment decisions for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

### Induction chemotherapy for advanced oral cavity cancer [^1133g36u]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Head and neck cancer is a heterogeneous disease, comprising multiple subsites with diverse etiologic factors, pathology and molecular features, response to treatment, and prognosis. Systemic treatment is usually incorporated in the management of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and the use of induction chemotherapy has theoretical benefits on reducing the risk of distant metastasis, provide an in vivo testing of response and tumor biology and the potential to allow a more personalized and less toxic local treatment after downstaging. The aim of this review is to access the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced oral cavity cancer.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials analyzing this treatment strategy in patients with resectable disease, followed by surgery, and in unresectable disease, followed by (chemo)radiotherapy or surgery are discussed, pointing out strengths and limitations of this data and highlighting the standard treatment in each clinical scenario. Future perspectives, including the incorporation of checkpoint inhibitors and biomarkers for patient selection are discussed. Surgery followed by (chemo)radiation is the standard of care for resectable oral cavity cancer patients, and chemoradiation is the standard for those considered as unresectable. Future trials with the incorporation of immunotherapy and better patient selection based on clinical and molecular biomarkers can bring new hopes for better therapeutic results in these patients.

Postoperative imaging after surgery for locoregionally advanced disease: For patients with locoregionally advanced disease who have undergone surgery, postoperative imaging is recommended if there are signs of early recurrence or for patients considered high risk of early recurrence, which may be needed to evaluate whether to proceed with the planned adjuvant radiation-based therapy and/or to determine targets and dosing of radiation in case of unexpected recurrence. Patients with positive margins, advanced T or N stage, or oral cavity cancers are at particular risk for rapid recurrence after surgery.

### Treatment delay and tumor size in patients with oral cancer during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic [^114KhaCA]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

Our recommendation is that if treatment delays occur due to limited resources, alternative treatment options should be presented, and advantages and disadvantages of these treatment plans must be weighed against the delay. It is noteworthy that head and neck surgeons continue to recommend primary surgical treatment for oral cavity cancers during the COVID‐19 pandemic. As far as is known, primary radiotherapy and radiochemotherapy are inferior to surgical treatment of early‐stage oral squamous cell carcinoma, whereas for only minor benefits for survival could be demonstrated for advanced‐stage disease. Nevertheless, the capacity of radiotherapy is also limited and carries other risks such as the occurrence of osteoradionecrosis.

Unfortunately, the trends toward delayed treatments and more advanced tumor sizes may continue in the next months and will possibly aggravate cancer treatment in the future. Therefore, physicians and responsible authorities should consider the presented results to prevent the deterioration of treatment outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and level IV/V metastasis and to compare patients who underwent no postoperative therapy with those who underwent postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).

Methods

We evaluated 669 patients. Clinicopathological data, postoperative therapy, and clinical course were investigated.

Results

Sixty-one patients (9.1%) developed level IV/V metastasis. The 3-year cumulative overall survival rates of patients with and without level IV/V metastasis were 47.3% and 64.3%, respectively. Tongue tumors, pN2 or N3 classification, and moderate or poor differentiation were significantly associated with the development of level IV/V metastasis. The surgery+RT/CCRT group was associated with better 3-year cumulative disease-specific survival and overall survival rates than the surgery only group.

Conclusion

Adjuvant therapy (RT alone or CCRT) after surgery is recommended for patients with level IV/V metastasis.

Non-surgical treatments (Table 2) were performed in 7 (26.9%) patients in the ≥ 85 years group and in 37 (11.1%) patients in the < 85 years group, respectively. These data show that surgery was significantly less frequently performed in the ≥ 85 years group (P = 0.028).

OS immediately after treatment initiation was shorter in the ≥ 85 years group, but the 5-year OS did not differ significantly between the ≥ 85 years and < 85 years groups (80.8% vs. 82.2%, P = 0.359; Fig. 1). OS (94.7% vs. 85.8%, P = 0.556; Fig. 2) and DFS (89.5% vs. 77.3%, P = 0.509; Fig. 3) in the surgery subgroup and OS in the non-surgery subgroup (42.9% vs. 33.2%, P = 0.762; Fig. 4) did not differ significantly between the ≥ 85 years and < 85 years groups. The maximum follow-up period was 42 months in the ≥ 85 years group.

2.3 Consensus voting

Clinical variants with corresponding treatment options were created to represent commonly encountered clinical scenarios, including those for which management is controversial (Tables 1A, 2A, 3A). These were reviewed by all panelists prior to voting. Variants were circulated for voting whereby panelists rated each treatment using a score of "1 to 9", representing "usually not appropriate" (1‐3), "may be appropriate (4‐6), and "usually appropriate" (7‐9). Panelists were blinded to each other's votes. The results were reviewed and discussed, maintaining anonymity of voting. A second round of voting was performed, and results were again reviewed and discussed prior to finalizing votes. The median score was determined and agreement was determined as per the BIOMED Concerted Action on Appropriateness definition outlined in the RAND/UCLA methodology 9 whereby agreement was defined as ≤ 3 votes outside the 3‐point region containing the median (1‐3;4‐6;7‐9), for a panel of 11 to 13, and ≤ 4 votes outside the 3‐point region containing the median for a panel of 14 to 16. Detailed voting results for the variant Tables 1A, 2A, 3A are provided in the Supporting Information. The strength of recommendations was graded using the GRADE system. 14

Finally, it is notable that ICT may have a role in the preoperative setting for cancers of the oral cavity. A meta-analysis of phase III studies comparing ICT → surgery (with or without postoperative radiotherapy) versus surgery (with or without postoperative radiotherapy) in resectable oral cavity SCC found a potential survival benefit of ICT in patients with N2 disease. A small randomized trial identified no survival benefit of preoperative ICT (before surgery and optional radiotherapy versus upfront surgery and optional radiotherapy) in patients with T2–T4, N0–N2 oral cavity SCC, but did note lowered fibrosis and dysphagia in the ICT arm at long-term follow-up, which the investigators ascribed to the fact that, with the use of ICT, less extensive surgery had to be carried out and fewer patients needed to receive postoperative radiation.

### Oral cavity cancer surgical and nodal management: a review from the American head and neck society [^117BDQPX]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Lymph node metastases from oral cavity cancers are seen frequently, and there is still inconsistency, and occasional controversies, regarding the surgical management of the neck in patients with oral cancer. This review is intended to offer a surgically focused discussion of the current recommendations regarding management of the neck, focusing on the indications and extent of dissection required in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma while balancing surgical risk and oncologic outcome.

Observations

The surgical management of the neck for oral cavity cancer has been robustly studied, as evidenced by substantial existing literature surrounding the topic. Prior published investigations have provided a sound foundation on which data-driven treatment algorithms can generally be recommended.

Conclusions

Existing literature suggests that patients with oral cavity cancer should be fully staged preoperatively, and most patients should receive a neck dissection even when clinically N0. Quality standards supported by the literature include separation of each level during specimen handling and lymph node yield of 18 or more nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered in select tumors and within a well-trained multidisciplinary team.

### Oral health in patients with history of head and neck cancer: complexity and benefits of a targeted oral healthcare pathway [^111643rg]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck cancers (HNCs) include a wide variety of malignant pathologies arising from the oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. Although 90% of them are squamous-cell carcinomas affecting mucosal surfaces, they are highly heterogeneous in their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. They represent the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 439,000 cases of oral and oropharyngeal cancer would be diagnosed by 2030. The current therapeutic arsenal includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Therapeutic decision of HNC is based on a multidisciplinary assessment of the patient's performance status, the disease's status, the anatomical situation, and the complexity of a surgical approach. Most of the treatment options, often used in combination, have significant side effects that can lead to long-term sequelae. Even though the last few decades have seen an improvement in management, with an increase in survival rate and quality of life, patients with a history of HNC (HNC patients) constitute a population with specific needs throughout their life course, particularly with regard to oral health. The aim of this work is therefore to provide a comprehensive overview of the oral health status of HNC patients, targeted at every actor in the healthcare pathway. This literature review provides (i) an in-depth description of the oral cavity during and after HNC through the prism of care complexity and (ii) a highlight of several potential key factors that could worsen long-time patients' prognosis and quality of life.

### Risk factors for salvage surgery failure in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^115Y4JAg]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Locoregional recurrences of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may be diagnosed during follow-up of surgically treated patients. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated factors that impact salvage surgery failure and the mortality rates of these patients. The objectives were to identify predictive factors of salvage surgery failure and mortality in patients who undergo surgical treatment for recurrent oral cavity SCC and to compare the overall survival rates of these patients with those of patients who undergo only one surgical treatment.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

Forty-six patients submitted to salvage surgery for local or locoregional recurrence.

Results

The presence of lymph node metastasis and positive surgical margins at the salvage surgery time were the only independent factors associated with both recurrence rates (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.04 and 2.82, respectively) and mortality (HR: 3.51 and 3.24, respectively). When the overall survival rates of the 199 patients who only underwent one surgical treatment were compared to those of the 46 patients subjected to salvage surgery, a similarity was evident when patients who underwent salvage surgery did not have a new disease recurrence (70.7% vs. 54.7%, respectively; p = 0.158). Likewise, patients with new recurrences after salvage surgery and patients who received palliative treatment for relapsed disease had similar overall survival rates (0.6% vs. 0.0%, respectively; p = 0.475).

Conclusions

The presence of lymph node metastasis at the time of recurrence and positive surgical margins after the salvage surgery were associated with a worse overall survival rate in patients with oral cavity SCC relapse.

### Primary chemotherapy in resectable oral cavity squamous cell cancer: a randomized controlled trial [^117DdXum]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prognosis of patients with advanced oral cavity cancer is worth improving. Chemotherapy has been reported to be especially active in oral cavity tumors. Here we repeat the results of a randomized, multicenter trial enrolling patients with a resectable, stage T2-T4 (> 3 cm), N0-N2, M0 untreated, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Patients and Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to three cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by surgery (chemotherapy arm) or surgery alone (control arm). In both arms, postoperative radiotherapy was reserved to high-risk patients, and surgery was modulated depending on the tumor's closeness to the mandible. Patients' accrual was opened in 1989 and closed in 1999. It included 195 patients.

Results

In the chemotherapy arm, three toxic deaths were recorded. No significant difference in overall survival was found. Five-year overall survival was, for both arms, 55%. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered in 33% of patients in the chemotherapy arm, versus 46% in the control arm. A mandible resection was performed in 52% of patients in the control arm, versus 31% in the chemotherapy arm.

Conclusion

The addition of primary chemotherapy to standard surgery was unable to improve survival. However, in this study, primary chemotherapy seemed to play a role in reducing the number of patients who needed to undergo mandibulectomy and/or radiation therapy. Variations in the criteria used to select patients for these treatment options may make it difficult to generalize these results, but there appears to be room for using preoperative chemotherapy to spare destructive surgery or radiation therapy in patients with advanced, resectable oral cavity cancer.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment methods and prognoses of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese population: a single institution retrospective cohort study [^112kLwt5]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

In our study, the OS rate decreased immediately after treatment initiation in the ≥ 85 years group (Fig. 3). Of these patients, an 87-year-old female with T3N0M0 (stage III) tongue cancer suddenly died of acute heart failure 2 weeks after partial glossectomy, with no findings suggesting cervical lymph node metastasis. Vascularized free skin flap reconstruction was not performed to minimize surgical stress, and the wound was treated with primary closure. The operative time was 1 h 36 min, and blood loss was minimal. Oral ingestion was started on the day following surgery, and the course of wound healing was favourable, but cardiopulmonary arrest occurred 7 days after surgery, and the patient died despite attempted resuscitation. A risk assessment of cardiac function was performed by a cardiologist before surgery, and a radiologist suggested that there was no cardiovascular contraindication for surgery. This case illustrates the difficulty of perioperative management in ≥ 85-year-old patients.

Although the definition of elderly is unclear, ≥ 65 years old is regarded as elderly in many countries. This is based on a declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1965 that when people aged ≥ 65 years exceed 7% of the population, society is regarded as an ageing society. The National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) classifies elderly patients into 3 groups: young old (65–74 years), older old (75–85 years), and oldest old (> 85 years). In some studies, half of new cancer patients not limited to oral cancer patients are ≥ 65 years old. The number of patients with oral SCC by year from the opening of our institute was calculated (Supplemental Fig. 1 A). The median number of patients per year from 1974 to 2018 was 11. After the opening our institute, there were only a few cases per year, but this stabilized at approximately 25 patients after 2005. The number of ≥ 85-year-old patients per year has remained nearly constant since 2000. The numbers of patients stratified by age until 2004 and in 2005 and thereafter were calculated (Supplemental Fig. 1 B). After 2005, the number of patients in their 60s increased. The peak age up to 2004 was 70–74 years old but shifted to 75–79 years old in and after 2005. Thus, the age of elderly patients with oral cancer in our institute is clearly increasing.

### Survival analysis and risk factors for recurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma: does surgical salvage affect outcome? [^115jixS6]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the outcomes and recurrence rates of subjects with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma treated at a single institution by primary surgical resection, with or without adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, to identify factors that affect locoregional control and determine whether surgical salvage affects survival.

Materials and Methods

The records of 157 subjects diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma treated at a single institution from 1997 to 2007 were identified. Data on demographics, site, clinical stage, pathologic stage, treatment, recurrence, and survival were collected. Defined outcome measures were overall survival, disease-free survival, and length of survival after recurrence. Analysis of the data was performed by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for disease-free survival, as well as survival by histologic grade, nodal status, recurrence, and tumor stage.

Results

We identified 157 subjects, with 155 meeting the inclusion criteria. The overall 5-year survival rate was 48%, with a disease-free survival rate of 42% (95% confidence interval, 36%-53%). Survival was found to be influenced by stage (P = .0001), nodal status (P = .0025), and histologic grade (P = .04). There were 24 subjects with recurrence (15%). Of these, 11 had local recurrence (46%), 9 had regional recurrence (37%), 2 had distant recurrence (8%), 1 had both local and regional recurrence (4%), and 1 had both local and distant metastasis (4%). Recurrence was not found to be significantly affected by pathologic stage (P = .71), clinical stage (P = .6), histologic grade (P = .178), postoperative radiation therapy (P = .54), postoperative chemotherapy (P = .66), N-positive status (P = .71), or whether the subject underwent a neck dissection (P = .984). Surgery significantly increased both overall survival time (P = .009) and survival time after recurrence (P = .006). Radiation therapy (P = .4) and chemotherapy (P = .82) did not have a survival benefit as therapy for recurrence.

Conclusions

Survival is influenced by stage at presentation, nodal status, and histologic grade. No variables were found to influence recurrence rates. Surgery significantly increased overall survival time, and salvage surgery increased survival after recurrence.

### What factors are associated with regional recurrence after operative treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma? [^1178Sxst]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

A considerable proportion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) recurrences involve the neck, which has a substantial impact on prognosis and is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical and pathologic characteristics of regional recurrence of OSCC and identify possible risk factors.

Materials and Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study was designed to address the study purpose. All patients who were treated surgically for primary OSCC with or without adjuvant therapy between 2010 and 2015 were considered for inclusion with respect to predefined criteria, and demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables were collected. The lymph node status after primary OSCC treatment (pN) was defined as the predictor variable, and the occurrence of regional recurrence served as the primary outcome variable. Further variables of special interest were the histologic differentiation (G status) of the primary OSCC and the values of the lymph node ratio and log odds of positive lymph nodes. Descriptive, inferential, and appropriate time-dependent (Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression model) statistics were computed. The level of statistical significance was set at P ≤ .05.

Results

The study sample was composed of 171 patients (70 women and 101 men; average age, 62.4 years). Neck failure occurred in 18 patients (11%) either in combination with local recurrence (15 patients) or in isolation (3 patients). Poor histologic differentiation of the primary tumor was identified as an independent risk factor for regional recurrence. Most neck recurrences manifested in previously unaddressed levels (IV and V).

Conclusions

Regional recurrence of OSCC might be associated with specific clinicopathologic parameters of the primary tumor. The importance of these parameters for OSCC prognosis assessment and recurrence prediction should be elucidated in further studies.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^116H8kWf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Evidence underlying elective neck dissection preference — In one randomized trial (Robertson et al), only 35 patients were enrolled, with the radiation-alone arm showing 2-year survival 10% compared with 55% for surgery plus radiotherapy and a 56% residual disease rate in the radiation-alone arm; another small randomized trial (Carnicie et al) reported disease-free survival favoring the surgical arm at 2-year (52% v 29%) and 5-year (29% v 0%) and included only six patients with oral cavity cancer; a prospective nonrandomized series treating 18 patients with elective neck radiation alone reported six recurrences, with four neck failures as first failure and two within the radiation volumes, for a crude isolated elective-neck failure of approximately 11%; a second prospective nonrandomized study treated 221 patients with more than 50 Gy and observed a 7% regional recurrence rate; in a large retrospective cohort of 785 head and neck cancer patients, overall recurrence neck rates with radiation alone versus neck dissection plus adjuvant radiotherapy were similar (94% v 97%), but lack of neck dissection was associated with increased neck recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 4.8; p = 0.003).

### Margins in stage I and II oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: a review from the American head and neck society [^113ZgvCn]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The assessment and management of surgical margins in stage I and II oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most important perioperative aspects of oncologic care, with profound implications for patient outcomes and adjuvant therapy. Understanding and critically reviewing the existing data surrounding margins in this context is necessary to rigorously care for this challenging group of patients and minimize patient morbidity and mortality.

Observations

This review discusses the data related to the definitions related to surgical margins, methods for assessment, specimen vs tumor bed margin evaluation, and re-resection of positive margins. The observations presented emphasize notable controversy within the field about margin assessment, with early data coalescing around several key aspects of management, although studies are limited by their design.

Conclusions and Relevance

Stage I and II oral cavity cancer requires surgical resection with negative margins to obtain optimal oncologic outcomes, but controversy persists over margin assessment. Future studies with improved, well-controlled study designs are required to more definitively guide margin assessment and management.

ASCO oral cavity cancer — management of the clinically negative and contralateral neck: Elective neck dissection is the preferred approach for patients with oral cavity cancer who require management of the clinically negative neck as outlined in recommendation 1.1a. Elective radiotherapy to a nondissected neck — 50 to 56 Gy in 25 to 30 fractions — may be efficacious and should be administered if surgery is not feasible. For patients who have undergone ipsilateral neck dissection only and are at substantial risk of contralateral nodal involvement — for example, tumor of the oral tongue and/or floor of the mouth that is T3/4 or approaches midline — contralateral neck radiotherapy should be administered to treat potential microscopic disease.

### Prognostic factors in salvage surgery for recurrent oral and oropharyngeal cancer [^115rJZCL]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic decisions in recurrent oral and oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma (SCC) remain controversial.

Methods

Two hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent salvage surgery for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity and oropharynx were studied. The tumor sites were lip, 33 cases; oral cavity, 143; oropharynx, 70. The previous treatment was surgery in 73 patients, radiotherapy in 96, combined surgery and radiotherapy in 76, and chemotherapy in one. The clinical stage of recurrence was I/II in 51 cases and III/IV in 195 cases. The disease-free interval (DFI) was less than 1 year in 156 cases and greater than 1 year in 90 cases.

Results

The rate of recurrence was 54.9%, and the overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 32.3%. The significant prognostic factors in multivariate analysis were restage (p = .049) and DFI (p = .045).

Conclusion

Patients with recurrent oral and oropharyngeal SCC at initial clinical stages (rCS I and II) and with a DFI greater than 1 year had a favorable prognosis.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^113PxDR1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation 6.2 — PET/CT response–guided neck management states that if PET/CT at 12 weeks or later shows mild FDG uptake in a node 1 cm or less or a persistently enlarged node 1 cm or greater without either mild or intense FDG uptake, the patient may be observed closely with serial cross-sectional imaging or PET/CT, and neck dissection is reserved for clinical or radiographic concern for progressive disease (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Supporting data report that at a median follow-up of 36 months, overall survival rates were 84.9% in the surveillance group and 81.5% in the planned neck dissection group, with locoregional control at 2 years of 91.9% versus 91.4%, respectively; surgical complications occurred in 42% of 54 patients who had neck dissection from the surveillance group versus 38% among 221 in the surgery group; the surveillance strategy produced a cost savings of $2,190 per patient and an incremental net health benefit of 0.21 quality-adjusted life years. Clinical interpretation notes that in the PET-NECK study, a residual mass without FDG uptake or mild FDG uptake in a normal-sized node was considered an incomplete or equivocal response and underwent neck dissection, but patients with residual lymph nodes that show no FDG uptake achieve high rates of long-term locoregional control, and mild FDG uptake — for example, SUV less than 3 — may reflect post-treatment inflammatory effects that can resolve with continued surveillance.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? Evidence-based management of oral cavity cancers [^111PD3kR]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common nonmelanoma head and neck cancer in the world, with an estimated 405 000 new cases expected each year. Subsites of the oral cavity include the alveolar ridge, buccal mucosa, anterior tongue, tonsillar pillar, retromolar trigone, hard palate, gingiva, and floor of the mouth. In this issue of the AHNS "Do you know your guidelines?" series, we review the evidence-based approach to the management of oral cavity carcinomas based on the framework provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.

### Systematic review of postoperative therapy for resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: executive summary of the American radium society appropriate use criteria [^111zajWo]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

4 TOPIC 1: SUMMARY OF STUDIES WITH ONCOLOGIC ENDPOINTS

4.1 The role of postoperative radiation therapy

There are two randomized trials comparing observation to PORT. One trial showed a disease‐free survival (DFS) benefit with PORT for patients with stage III/IV buccal mucosa cancers. 45 The other randomized trial demonstrated a non‐statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (55.6% vs 36.5%, P = NS, exact value not reported). 41 Single arm phase I and phase II studies showed that PORT can be sequenced after minimally invasive surgery including transoral laser supraglottic laryngectomy, 58 and transoral robotic surgery. 62, 69, 82

The regular use of PORT for resected stage III/IV SCCHN is based on both retrospective and prospective studies. These demonstrated worse local‐regional control after surgery alone or after PORT, for patients with pathologic risk factors for recurrence, compared to patients without risk factors. Individual pathologic risk factors for recurrence include: T3 or T4 tumors, multiple involved nodes, lymphovascular invasion, anatomic location (eg, oral cavity vs oropharynx), low neck location of lymph nodes, extranodal extension (ENE), perineural invasion, and close/positive margins. 42, 46, 55, 64, 65, 85, 116 An increasing number of risk factors is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. 31, 46

Additional risk factors for recurrence identified in retrospective studies that are not regularly incorporated as selection criteria in prospective studies of PORT or chemo‐PORT include poorly differentiated tumors 117, 118 and, for oral cavity cancers, depth of invasion (DOI). 4, 5 The AJCC‐8th edition staging incorporated DOI in the staging for oral cavity cancers in recognition of its prognostic significance.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment methods and prognoses of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese population: a single institution retrospective cohort study [^111dQMAT]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of new cases of oral cancer each year exceeds 350,000 worldwide, and the cumulative risk in those under the age of 75 was reported to be 0.46 in 2018. Oral cancer develops in the tongue, mandibular gingiva, maxillary gingiva, buccal mucosa, hard palate, oral floor and lips. Most oral cancers are histologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), because the surface of oral mucosa consists of squamous epithelium. However, salivary gland tumours, malignant lymphomas, malignant melanomas, and mesenchymal tumours may also develop in oral cavity. Surgery is mainly performed for the treatment of oral SCCs and sometimes combined with chemotherapy (including molecular targeted treatment), immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and radiation. These treatments have considerably improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with oral SCCs. However, some patients have shown local recurrence, cervical lymph node metastasis, or distal metastasis after the initial treatment, and it is difficult to achieve complete cure in such patients.

Japan currently has the highest life expectancy (84.2 years old: male: 81.1, female: 87.1) and healthy life expectancy (74.8 years old) at birth worldwide. People aged ≥ 65 years accounted for 26.0% of the total Japanese population in 2015, and this is estimated to increase to 36.4% by 2050. Thus, the number of elderly patients with oral cancer are likely to increase in Japan; this situation may serve as a model for other countries with ageing populations. In fact, the number of oral SCC patients at our institution has increased annually since it was opened in 1974, and the age distribution shows an increasing trend (Supplemental Figure 1 A and B). In many reports and reviews focused on elderly patients with different types of cancers, those aged 65, 70, or 75 years old or older were regarded as elderly. However, a detailed investigation of patients aged over 85 years old with oral cancer has not been reported.

### Improving the rate of negative margins after surgery for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: a prospective randomized controlled study [^115ntLvK]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A positive margin is among the most significant factors that affects the outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The purpose of this study was to compare the negative margin rates between 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment in patients with oral cavity SCC.

Methods

A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment: specimen-driven margins and patient-driven margins.

Results

The final analysis included 71 patients, 20 (29%) in the patient-driven margin arm. Frozen section analysis revealed positive/close surgical margins that led to an extension of the surgical resection in 22 of 51 patients (43%) in the specimen-driven margin arm, and 2 of 20 patients (10%) in the patient-driven margin arm (p = .01). After final pathological analysis, the wide negative margin rate was 84% in the specimen-driven margin arm, compared to 55% in the patient-driven margin arm (p = .02). Extension of the surgical resection prevented escalation of adjuvant treatment in 19 patients (38%) in the specimen-driven margin arm and 10% in the patient-driven margin arm.

Conclusion

Specimen derived margin assessment led to significant improvement in the rate of negative margins. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1803-E1809, 2016.

### Treatment choice for locally advanced head and neck cancers on the basis of risk factors: biological risk factors [^112eJ4ag]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma often experience relapse, the cause of poor survival statistics. Relapse occurs following the three main types of treatment, surgery with or without post-operative (chemo)radiotherapy, or chemoradiation (containing cisplatin). Cancer relapse can result from (i) outgrowth of residual tumour cells, sometimes with a number too small to be detected by routine histopathology or (ii) development of another carcinoma in a field of pre-neoplastic cells that has remained after treatment of the primary carcinoma. At this moment, clinical staging is not enough to identify patients who will develop relapse and who need tailored treatment. This review describes the latest knowledge of mechanisms of cancer relapse, addresses the biomarkers of potential interest detectable in the tissue of the tumour or its surgical margins and discusses three biomarkers, human papillomavirus, TP53 and epidermal growth receptor in more detail. Once a marker panel has been established, treatment should be focussed on the patients at risk of relapse by improved tailoring of existing treatment modalities. Also, the implementation of more targeting therapies based on the characteristics of the discovered markers should lead to better survival rates.

### Rethinking surgical margins: a new approach to predict outcomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma [^112WEAzx]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that analyzing surgical margin distance for OCSCC as a continuous variable, rather than a categorical variable, offers enhanced predictive capabilities for locoregional control and survival. The utilization of margin distance as a continuous variable proves to be a valuable tool for predicting local control and prognosis in OCSCC cases. Further research should prioritize the development of a robust prediction model that can effectively guide disease management strategies and provide clinicians with reliable prognostic information.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment methods and prognoses of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese population: a single institution retrospective cohort study [^111Gngzy]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The status of oral cancer therapy in elderly patients in Japan, where ageing is rapidly progressing, may serve as a model for other countries with similar demographics. There is controversy over what kind of treatment should be applied and how aggressively it should be applied to very elderly patients who have exceeded the average life expectancy. Given that 85 years is approximately the overall Japanese life expectancy at birth, we considered a threshold of 85 years and hypothesized that the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients aged ≥ 85 years was not inferior to that of those < 85 years. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment methods, and prognoses of Japanese oral SCC patients aged ≥ 85 years.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed. The data of patients with primary oral SCC (n = 358) from 2005 to 2018 in our institute were extracted from electronic medical records. A total of 358 patients with oral SCC were divided into two groups (≥ 85 years group [n = 26] and < 85 years group [n = 332]) based on the age threshold of 85 years at the first visit. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse overall survival (OS) and hazard ratios (HRs) according to age group, treatment, and TNM classification.

Results

There was no difference in the 5-year OS rate between the ≥ 85 years and < 85 years groups (80.8% vs. 82.2%, P = 0.359). This finding was the same in the operative (94.7% vs. 85.8%, P = 0.556) and non-operative (42.9% vs. 33.2%, P = 0.762) groups, indicating that age did not affect prognosis. Mortality was lower in the operative group than in the non-operative group (adjusted HR: 0.276, 95% CI: 0.156–0.489, P < 0.001), suggesting that surgery is a superior method. However, non-surgical treatment was selected at a higher rate in the ≥ 85 years group (26.9% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.028).

Conclusions

This study suggests the prognosis of ≥ 85-year-old patients was not inferior to that of < 85-year-old patients. We recommend that surgery as the first choice treatment for ≥ 85-year-old patients with oral SCC who can tolerate surgery should be performed.

### Systematic review of postoperative therapy for resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: executive summary of the American radium society appropriate use criteria [^115fYqD8]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

8.1 Summary of recommendations

The committee strongly recommends that postoperative therapy decisions be based on consideration of the factors that were used in the assignment of T‐ and N‐categories prior to the AJCC 8th edition as clinical trials that form the basis of the above recommendations employed staging prior to the recent AJCC staging criteria.
The committee identified several areas of controversy and subject for future research, as shown in the Clinical Variants (Tables 1A, 2A, 3A) and mentioned below, where there was insufficient agreement to provide a consensus recommendation.
The committee strongly recommends that it is usually appropriate that postoperative radiation therapy should be initiated within 6 weeks of surgery when postoperative healing permits.
The committee strongly recommends that concurrent systemic therapy is usually appropriate for relatively "fit" patients who have microscopically involved surgical margins and/or extranodal extension.
The committee strongly recommends concurrent cisplatin‐based therapy as usually appropriate. Specifically, cisplatin 100 mg/m 2, is recommended as usually appropriate when concurrent therapy is indicated. There is insufficient evidence comparing three‐weekly cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 to weekly cisplatin at doses of at least 40 mg/m 2 weekly, which may be appropriate, to support adoption of the latter schedule.
The committee strongly recommends that altered fractionation should be considered usually appropriate for patients who are not medically eligible for chemotherapy but have risk factors that otherwise would warrant the addition of chemotherapy. The committee acknowledges that most studies showing the benefit of altered fractionation were performed in the pre‐IMRT era. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a preferred altered fractionation regimen.
The committee strongly recommends postoperative radiation therapy as usually appropriate for patients with intermediate risk factors for recurrence, including pT3‐4 tumors, multiple involved nodes, or a single node > 6 cm.
The committee strongly recommends additional therapy as usually appropriate for early‐stage oral tongue cancer with a positive margin. PORT‐alone was strongly recommended as usually appropriate when re‐excision is not performed to clear the region of the close/positive margin. Yet there was insufficient agreement on the appropriateness of PORT to the primary‐site only or unilateral or bilateral neck irradiation. There was insufficient agreement on the role of concurrent systemic therapy or altered fractionation for this situation.
The committee recommends PORT as usually appropriate for early‐stage oral tongue cancer with increased depth of invasion (DOI); there is insufficient evidence to routinely recommend PORT for a specific DOI. While agreement was not reached on the appropriateness of unilateral or bilateral nodal irradiation, the committee recommended against PORT to the primary site only, which is usually not appropriate for oral cavity cancer with increased DOI.
The committee does not recommend de‐escalation of postoperative therapy, including reduced‐dose PORT or omission of chemotherapy for p16+ oropharynx cancer, in routine clinical practice until additional high‐quality prospective data is available including publication of ECOG 3311.
Clinical studies that compare standard of care postoperative therapy to de‐intensified therapy will be published in the upcoming years and may change the above recommendations.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^112ZzUEt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO oropharyngeal and advanced disease — neck management directives: Patients with lateralized oropharyngeal carcinoma who are being treated with upfront curative surgery should undergo an ipsilateral neck dissection of levels II to IV, and an adequate dissection should include at least 18 lymph nodes. Patients with lateralized oropharyngeal cancer who undergo neck dissection concurrently or before transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery should have ligation of at-risk feeding blood vessels to reduce the severity and incidence of postoperative bleeding. Patients with tumors that extend to the midline tongue base or palate or that involve the posterior oropharyngeal wall should have bilateral neck dissections performed unless bilateral adjuvant radiotherapy is planned, and the multidisciplinary team should discuss with patients the potential functional impact of bilateral neck dissection and postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. A nonsurgical approach should be offered to patients with cN+ disease who have either unequivocal extranodal extension into surrounding soft tissues or carotid artery or cranial nerve involvement. Patients with biopsy-proven distant metastases should not undergo routine surgical resection of metastatic cervical lymph nodes.

### Interventions for the treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer: chemotherapy [^112NoAzT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers are frequently described as part of a group of oral cancers or head and neck cancer. Treatment of oral cavity cancer is generally surgery followed by radiotherapy, whereas oropharyngeal cancers, which are more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, are managed with radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Surgery for oral cancers can be disfiguring and both surgery and radiotherapy have significant functional side effects, notably impaired ability to eat, drink and talk. The development of new chemotherapy agents, new combinations of agents and changes in the relative timing of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatments may potentially bring about increases in both survival and quality of life for this group of patients.

Objectives

To determine whether chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer results in improved survival, disease free survival, progression free survival, locoregional control and reduced recurrence of disease. To determine which regimen and time of administration (induction, concomitant or adjuvant) is associated with better outcomes.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED were undertaken on 1st December 2010. Reference lists of recent reviews and included studies were also searched to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared the addition of chemotherapy to other treatments such as radiotherapy and/or surgery, or compared two or more chemotherapy regimens or modes of administration, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eighty-nine trials which met the inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias and data were extracted by two or more review authors. The primary outcome was total mortality. Trial authors were contacted for additional information or for clarification.

Main Results

There is evidence of a small increase in overall survival associated with induction chemotherapy compared to locoregional treatment alone (25 trials), hazard ratio (HR) of mortality 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.00, P = 0.06). Post-surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved overall survival compared to surgery ± radiotherapy alone (10 trials), HR of mortality 0.88 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, P = 0.03), and there is some evidence that this improvement may be greater with concomitant adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (4 trials), HR of mortality 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03). In patients with unresectable tumours, there is evidence that concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy is associated with improved survival compared to radiotherapy alone (26 trials), HR of mortality 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83, P < 0.00001). These findings are confirmed by sensitivity analyses based on studies assessed at low risk of bias. There is insufficient evidence to identify which agent(s) and/or regimen(s) are the most effective. The additional toxicity attributable to chemotherapy in the combined regimens remains unquantified.

Authors' Conclusions

Chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and surgery, is associated with improved overall survival in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. Induction chemotherapy may prolong survival by 8 to 20% and adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy may prolong survival by up to 16%. In patients with unresectable tumours, concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy may prolong survival by 10 to 22%. There is insufficient evidence as to which agent or regimen is most effective and the additional toxicity associated with chemotherapy given in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery cannot be quantified.

### Optimal adjuvant therapy of head and neck squamous cancer after primary surgical resection [^113vKRfn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal selection of patients for adjuvant therapy following primary surgery for head and neck squamous cancer is challenging. Decision-making depends on a range of patient and disease factors including the presence or otherwise of a host of pathologic risk factors. Postoperative radiotherapy is the standard of care for advanced disease and has a role for early-stage disease in the presence of multiple risk factors. Concurrent chemotherapy improves outcomes for high-risk pathology having extranodal extension and/or very close/positive margins, and in these patients, immunotherapy in the perioperative period is associated with better locoregional control. Adjuvant therapy has significant toxicity.

### Contribution of genomics to the surgical management and study of oral cancer [^117Wat1E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity (lips, buccal mucosa, anterior tongue, hard palate, floor of mouth, and alveolar ridge) constitutes the most frequent primary location of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) classically occurs in a context of chronic alcohol and tobacco use. Areca nut-chewing also constitutes an established risk factor for OSCC in specific areas of Asia.

Although human papillomavirus (HPV) has not been established as having a role in the development of OSCC, the oral cavity is characterized by the presence of an oral microbiote, whose contribution to the induction of inflammation and tumor promotion in this location is discussed. Management of OSCC involves different medical specialties with complementary expertise, but surgery usually is the first treatment method. Tumor anatomic determinants are in general the main criteria used for the initial prognosis assessment. The final pathologic examination of the tumor establishes the choice of therapy.

The recent revised version of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) recognizes the increasing importance of features related to tumor biology. For example, the depth of invasion (DOI) is a useful parameter, together with the well-known criteria that determine OSCC prognosis including the presence of invaded surgical margins (SMs), extra-nodal extension (ENE), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). Positive SM or ENE identify advanced tumor stages that require heavy medical treatments. Both LVI and PNI play an important role in the choice of treatment for early OSCC, although the corresponding pathologic diagnoses might sometimes be difficult and poorly standardized. The need to introduce biomarkers and standardize medical practices is fueling a growing interest in tumor biology as a determinant of the OSCC response to surgery.

### Second salvage surgery for re-recurrent oral cavity and oropharynx carcinoma [^112esF7u]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Salvage surgery is considered the best treatment approach for patients with recurrent oral carcinoma. Unfortunately, 50% to 60% of the patients who undergo salvage surgery will develop further locoregional recurrence, and they are not usually considered for further treatment. Our aim in this study was to report our experience with a second salvage surgery for selected patients with re-recurrent oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Methods

Forty-one patients underwent a second salvage surgical procedure, with curative intention for re-recurrent oral cancer. The surgical treatment used was wide local resection in 34 cases, neck dissection in 9 cases, and isolated neck dissection in 7 cases.

Results

Cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate in 3 years was at 20%. Patients with re-recurrence in < 6 months presented 3-year CSS null, whereas patients with re-recurrence after 6 months presented 3-year CSS of 32.3% (p = .007).

Conclusion

Second salvage surgery can be considered a potentially curative therapeutic approach for a selected group of patients with re-recurrent oral SCC. The disease-free interval was the main clinical factor associated with the prognosis.

### The expanding role of systemic therapy in head and neck cancer [^112E6J23]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has evolved greatly in the last two decades, owing to the integration of chemotherapy, advances in radiotherapeutic techniques, and organ-preserving surgery. Several randomized trials have established new standards of care that should be adopted. Current efforts are building on these earlier trials in order to improve survival and quality of life. Coincident with this, investigators are developing molecularly targeted approaches that hold promise for the future. This review will focus on current therapy for locally advanced, recurrent, and metastatic SCCHN and discuss controversies and directions for future research.

### The impact of stratified surgical margins on survival outcomes in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: a multicenter analysis [^113uUHuN]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This multicenter study examines the impact of stratified surgical margins on treatment outcomes in oral SCC.

Methods

Margins were stratified into 1mm increments from 0 to ≥ 5mm. Outcomes included local recurrence, overall and disease-specific survivals. Sub-analyses assessed the impact of margin status by risk factors, oral subsites, and peripheral versus deep margins.

Results

Among 2737 patients, ≥ 2 to < 3mm margins were associated with improved outcomes compared to 0mm. Further benefits were observed in the ≥ 4 to < 5mm group. The differences between these two groups were not statistically significant. Improved outcomes were observed with ≥ 2mm deep margins, but not for peripheral margins. High-risk tumors had better overall and disease-specific survivals with ≥ 2mm margins. Subsites of the tongue, palate, mandible, and floor of the mouth had improved local control with ≥ 2mm margins.

Conclusion

Margins beyond 4mm do not confer additional oncological benefit, while achieving ≥ 2mm, especially in deep margins or high-risk tumors, is critical for optimal outcomes.

### Current clinical outcomes demand new treatment options for SCCHN [^1151HDKR]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer can be a devastating disease. The mainstays of treatment for early stage disease are either radiotherapy or surgery. However, although disease responds well at this stage, the risk of a second primary cancer is high, with a development rate of about 4% per year. Advanced diseases are treated either by surgery with postoperative radiotherapy or by definitive radiotherapy, with surgery in reserve for salvage if necessary. Over the past two decades major advances have been made in surgery (reconstructive surgery, non-mutilating surgery). Either definitive or postoperative, radiotherapy is an integral part of the treatment for the majority of non-metastatic stages of disease and ways of improving the effects of radiotherapy are constantly being explored. Good activity has been reported for the use of altered radiation fractionation regimens, which allow the delivery of intensified radiation doses. In addition, in recent years randomized trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the survival benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy in a number of different settings. Cisplatin-based regimens have been identified as the most active and are now standard treatment choices. The survival benefits of chemotherapy appear to be limited to concomitant administration and do not extend to neoadjuvant administration, although this has demonstrated clinical utility in preserving organ function. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is by many clinicians considered the standard approach to the treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease for patients who are able to tolerate such regimens, but the prognosis for these patients remains poor; this is particularly true for those whose disease progresses on such therapy. This paper discusses current approaches and recent advances in the treatment of head and neck cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma, and suggests future management aims for the different disease stages.

### Current treatment strategies and risk stratification for oral carcinoma… [^112iHzTH]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract Management of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma involves a multidisciplinary team approach. Surgery is ideally the primary treatment option for nonmetastatic OSCC, and less invasive curative surgical approaches are preferred in early-stage disease to minimize surgical-related morbidity. For patients at high risk of recurrence, adjuvant treatment using radiation therapy or chemoradiation is often used. 2Surgery remains the primary treatment approach for OSCC. 6However, morbid effects on cosmetic and functional outcomes related to the extent of disease and the required surgical resection emphasize the importance of using less invasive curative surgical approaches in early-stage disease to minimize surgical-related morbidity.

10, 11Systemic therapy is usually indicated in such cases; however, it can potentially be used in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with advanced-stage disease aiming for tumor reduction that may permit better functional and cosmetic outcomes, while maintaining similar oncologic outcomes. 12, 13. In addition, a National Cancer Database retrospective study revealed equal OS for SLN biopsy compared with END with a reduced hospital length of stay for patients undergoing SLN biopsy. 36A multicenter RCT reported in 2020 performed by Garrel et al 37with 307 patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer receiving either SLN biopsy or END revealed similar recurrence-free survival and OS with noninferiority margin at 10%. Once the early recurrence is confirmed, intensified postoperative treatment strategies should be discussed with the patient by the multidisciplinary team members.

Salvage treatment options include additional revision surgery; use of intensified radiation by planning higher total radiation dose, higher radiation dose per fraction, or accelerated PORT schedules. 90, 91Somewhat more controversial is the role of induction chemotherapy for organ preservation in advanced OSCC. 92, 93In OSCC that invades or abuts the mandible, surgical management has traditionally involved a mandibulectomy. However, mandibular resection is associated with long-term morbidities even after sophisticated reconstruction techniques, including impairment in speech and swallowing, cosmesis, body image, and QOL. 94–96Preservation of the native mandible thus represents a worthwhile endeavor. Induction chemotherapy is one of the strategies used to shrink the tumor preoperatively and facilitate mandibular preservation.

### Survival after salvage surgery for recurrent oral cavity cancer… [^112HLcy3]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What is the prognosis for patients undergoing salvage surgery following locoregional recurrence of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Findings In this cohort study, the most important determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing curative intent salvage surgery for locoregionally recurrent oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma was adjuvant therapy after primary surgery. Patients who received prior adjuvant therapy had a 5-year survival of 10% compared with 74% in the lowest risk group. Meaning Patients who received adjuvant therapy following primary surgery had significantly worse survival following salvage surgery for locoregionally recurrent oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Importance Locoregional recurrence of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma continues to be a life-threatening and difficult clinical situation.

Salvage surgery can result in significant morbidities, and survival following recurrence is poor. This study aimed to characterize prognostic factors influencing survival following salvage surgery for recurrent OCSCC to stratify patients into risk groups according to prognosis and better guide treatment decisions for patients. Recursive partitioning analysis demonstrated that the most important negative prognostic factor for OS was adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy following primary surgery. Age older than 62 years was found to be the second most important negative prognostic indicator. These 2 prognostic factors allowed subdivision into 3 risk groups. Our study found a significant difference in prognosis in patients undergoing salvage surgery for OCSCC based on whether adjuvant therapy was received after the initial cancer surgery.

Five-year OS was poor in patients whose cancer recurred when the initial treatment procedure was surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Given the low chance of cure with salvage therapy, surgery should be undertaken after careful consideration of the potential surgical morbidity and a realistic chance of long-term disease control. In contrast, 5-year OS was better in patients younger than 62 years whose initial treatment consisted of surgery alone. Patients undergoing salvage surgery with curative intent for recurrent OCSCC have a poor prognosis. Those who received adjuvant treatment at the time of initial treatment had the worst outcome with a 5-year OS of 10%. Patients who underwent only primary surgery for their initial tumor fared better. This marked difference in OS should be taken into consideration with patient comorbidities, potential morbidity of surgery, and patient goals when deciding treatment options for patients with recurrent OCSCC.

### ASCO guidelines… [^115ShfAu]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

And mostly what we say is if you have a primary tumor that's like a T3 or T4 oral cavity cancer or it approaches midline, either a contralateral neck dissection should be done or radiation should be done to the contralateral neck. And even if you have a lot of lymph nodes taken out and they're negative, if you have very high-risk primary tumor features like very large tumor or multifocal perineural invasion, those kinds of things, even with a negative neck dissection we still typically do treat the neck. So the next recommendation that's really helpful is who can be observed after surgery. And specifically low-volume N1 you can consider observing in oral cavity cancer, whereas N2 or N3 patients all need radiation or chemoradiation in the setting of extranodal extension and positive margins.

We did come out pretty firmly advocating for bolus cisplatin 100 milligrams per meter squared every three weeks as recent studies suggest that weekly cisplatin or other regimens are not as effective, and we were pretty clear about that. We were pretty synchronized with recent ASCO-endorsed guidelines in oropharynx cancer that say similar things. I think in oropharynx cancer everybody feels pretty comfortably yes. I think in oral cavity cancer it's been somewhat controversial. We favor neck dissections when possible, but if radiation is known to be happening, especially to an elective contralateral neck, that that is adequate therapy. And typically if tumors extend to midline or involve the posterior oropharyngeal wall, which has bilateral drainage, that either bilateral neck dissection should be performed in those cases or a unilateral neck dissection can be done as long as adjuvant radiation is planned to both necks.

Finally, a couple of very important questions of who should not be treated surgically and who should be treated with a nonoperative chemoradiation based approach. In oral cavity cancer, as long as they were not metastatic, we felt people should be resected as long as they were surgically resectable and medically operable. In oropharynx cancer, however, anybody who had unequivocal extranodal extension of nodes into soft tissues or involvement to the carotid artery or extensive cranial-nerve involvement or skull-based involvement by extensive nodal disease are not good candidates for surgery and should be preferentially treated with chemoradiation. That was pretty strong.

- where the tumor is in the lip or oral cavity
- whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels For patients who smoke, the chance of recovery is better if they stop smoking before beginning radiation therapy. Treatment options depend on:

- the stage of the cancer
- the size of the tumor and where it is in the lip or oral cavity
- whether the patient's appearance and ability to talk and eat can stay the same
- the patient's age and general health Patients who have had lip and oral cavity cancer have an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important. Clinical trials are studying the use of retinoid drugs to reduce the risk of a second head and neck cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
