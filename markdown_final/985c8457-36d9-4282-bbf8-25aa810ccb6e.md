medications to help elderly sleep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications to help older adults sleep — pharmacologic management of insomnia in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle of non-pharmacologic first-line therapy and its evidence base. Then, I should verify when pharmacotherapy is appropriate after CBT-I, including severity thresholds and shared decision-making. Next, I will examine each medication class for efficacy, safety, and geriatric risks, and I must be careful to check guideline positions versus real-world harms. After that, I need to synthesize duration limits, monitoring, and deprescribing strategies. Finally, I should consider special populations and comorbidities, and close with a practical, clinically actionable approach that aligns with the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: CBT-I is the recommended first-line therapy across major guidelines for adults of any age, including older adults, and can be delivered face-to-face or digitally with sleep restriction and stimulus control as core elements, so I need to ensure this is offered before medications are considered [^1173F5ek] [^116NEnff] [^113auRx1]. Hold on, I should verify whether nonpharmacologic treatment also meaningfully affects broader outcomes; yes, CBT-I in older adults reduces incident and recurrent depression over long-term follow-up, and nonpharmacologic insomnia treatments improve cognition, which strengthens the case to prioritize CBT-I in this population [^116EGjH1] [^116RZYu1]. I need to check adjuncts: exercise can be recommended as an adjunct to CBT-I to support sleep health, while sleep hygiene alone is insufficient as a stand-alone intervention but may be supportive for awareness and access [^115aAyxy] [^1164jWQL].

> Next, I should review when pharmacotherapy is appropriate in older adults because of heightened risks. I need to ensure medications are reserved for situations such as insufficient response after an adequate CBT-I trial, severe acute insomnia causing significant distress or impairment, short-term adjunctive use during CBT-I, or targeted use when insomnia exacerbates comorbid conditions, all via shared decision-making about benefits, harms, and duration limits [^113E7Xte] [^116NEnff] [^113Xs6Gk]. Wait, let me verify the principle on duration before I go class-by-class; guidance consistently discourages long-term hypnotic use and emphasizes shortest effective duration and reassessment, especially in seniors, which will anchor my later recommendations [^113Xs6Gk].

> I will now examine benzodiazepines. Guidelines allow short-term use, with some suggesting specific agents like triazolam for onset and temazepam for onset/maintenance, but evidence quality is low and geriatric safety concerns are substantial [^114ozjkD] [^115YfXEG] [^115xeZsx]. Let me check the risk-benefit balance in older adults: meta-analysis in seniors shows only small improvements in sleep quality but a marked increase in adverse effects like daytime fatigue, and real-world risks include falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, and dependence, so I should be very cautious here [^111u5L4j]. Initially I was going to say "never consider beyond two weeks", but wait, I should verify whether any guideline even contemplates longer-term BZD use; the European guideline does allow longer-term or intermittent use in selected patients after individualized discussion, yet in older adults the cumulative risks typically outweigh benefits, so any use should be rare, brief, and closely monitored with a clear exit plan [^113NgeWU] [^114ozjkD].

> Now, I need to consider the nonbenzodiazepine "Z-drugs" (zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, zopiclone). Guidelines suggest short-term use for sleep-onset and/or maintenance complaints, and some European guidance permits selected longer-term or intermittent use, but I should confirm differential safety signals in the elderly [^112HrsPY] [^115ebFKm] [^114v8MUs] [^112XKYfQ] [^117Ucop8]. Short-term trials in older adults show modest efficacy with acceptable short-term safety, yet observational data link longer-term Z-drug use with increased falls and fractures versus no treatment or melatonin agonists, and real-world studies show high rates of inappropriate prescribing in seniors, predominantly due to extended duration, which I must factor into risk counseling and monitoring [^116ddxsV] [^117U8AdT] [^112T8Crm]. But wait, what if there are broader neurocognitive risks? Observational cohorts suggest an association between frequent hypnotic use and incident dementia, particularly in White populations, so I should prefer the shortest possible course at the lowest effective dose and favor shorter half-life agents when a Z-drug is used at all, recognizing this evidence is observational and confounded but still concerning in geriatric care [^111Aa1yG] [^115K3JaA]. I should double-check labeling cautions on tolerance and dependence as well; zaleplon's label underscores limited evidence beyond 4 weeks and the potential for dependence, reinforcing time limits and reassessment [^115GxDbw].

> Let me consider orexin receptor antagonists next (suvorexant, lemborexant, daridorexant). AASM suggests offering suvorexant for sleep maintenance, and European guidance supports considering longer-term use in selected patients after individualized discussion, which may be especially relevant if therapy must extend beyond a few weeks in older adults due to a more favorable mechanism targeting wake drive rather than global CNS depression [^115ebFKm] [^117Hy74z]. I should confirm effect sizes and safety: the ACP evidence report shows small but clinically relevant improvements with suvorexant relative to placebo, and while head-to-head geriatric data are limited, the class may have lower risks of falls and respiratory depression compared to BZRAs, making them reasonable when medication is required for maintenance insomnia in seniors, with attention to next-day somnolence and CYP3A interactions [^112AiBos] [^117Hy74z]. Hold on, I need to ensure hepatic metabolism and polypharmacy are reviewed in older adults, as CYP3A inhibitors are common, which can raise exposure and adverse effects, so careful dose selection and interaction checks are mandatory [^117Hy74z].

> I will now examine melatonin receptor agonists and melatonin. Ramelteon is an option for sleep-onset difficulty with modest benefit and minimal adverse effects, and prolonged-release melatonin is specifically recommended in adults over 55 years, including consideration for longer-term use up to three months in selected cases, aligning well with geriatric safety priorities [^111vt37A] [^112Pw3DQ] [^116UfSZv]. Let me verify physiologic dosing considerations: physiologic-dose melatonin (around 0.3 mg) restored sleep efficiency in older adults and avoided daytime elevations seen with higher doses, suggesting that lower doses may be better tolerated and sufficient when used as a chronobiotic in age-related insomnia, though products and formulations vary in practice [^115Vg1nV]. I need to check comparative safety: observational data suggest melatonin agonists carry lower long-term risks of falls and fractures than Z-drugs, further supporting their use ahead of sedative-hypnotics in older adults, particularly for sleep-onset complaints or circadian contributions to insomnia [^116ddxsV] [^116UfSZv].

> Next, I should review low-dose doxepin. AASM recommends considering doxepin for sleep-maintenance insomnia, and primary care guidance supports offering low-dose formulations, which act via H1 blockade rather than antidepressant mechanisms at 3–6 mg, but I should monitor for anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, and falls, especially in the very old or those with polypharmacy [^115Qdvic] [^114X6wdZ]. Wait, I should verify that geriatric-specific data beyond age 75 are limited; yes, evidence is sparse in the oldest old, which means I should use the lowest effective dose, reassess early, and stop if adverse effects emerge, particularly in patients with cognitive vulnerability or autonomic dysfunction [^115Qdvic].

> I need to be explicit about agents to avoid for primary insomnia in older adults. Sedating antidepressants like trazodone, antipsychotics, and first-generation antihistamines lack robust efficacy and carry substantial risks, so major guidelines recommend against their routine use for insomnia; herbal and phytotherapeutics are also not recommended, and medical cannabis remains investigational with insufficient high-quality evidence and safety concerns in elders, so these should not be first- or second-line choices in this population [^112AiBos] [^115yN292] [^117WZuro] [^111G1WEx] [^115nqXGH]. Hold on, let me reconsider one potential counterexample: older APA dementia guidance included trazodone and Z-drugs as options after nonpharmacologic failure, but contemporary insomnia guidelines emphasize the risk burden and insufficient evidence for these in primary insomnia, particularly in the elderly, so I should align with the newer insomnia-specific guidance and geriatric safety principles [^116u1vkm] [^112AiBos].

> Now I should synthesize duration limits and monitoring. For benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, initial courses should be short, typically no more than four weeks with reassessment at 2 and 4 weeks for efficacy, adverse effects, and functional outcomes, given tolerance, dependence, and falls risk in older adults; product labeling and primary care guidance align with this time-limited approach [^113Xs6Gk] [^114v8MUs] [^114ozjkD] [^115GxDbw]. For longer-term needs after CBT-I failure where benefits clearly outweigh risks, I should prefer orexin receptor antagonists for sleep-maintenance phenotypes or prolonged-release melatonin for sleep-onset/circadian components, with individualized counseling about interactions and next-day somnolence, and with periodic attempts to reduce dose or discontinue as feasible [^117Hy74z] [^116UfSZv]. I need to ensure ongoing monitoring includes falls, cognition, daytime function, driving risk, and polypharmacy interactions, and that nonpharmacologic strategies continue in parallel to reduce pharmacologic exposure over time [^113Xs6Gk].

> I should confirm deprescribing strategies up front. For older adults taking benzodiazepine receptor agonists, slow tapering is recommended, ideally while initiating or reinforcing CBT-I to improve success, reduce withdrawal symptoms, and sustain gains, and taper schedules should be individualized to prior dose, duration, and comorbidities, with clear patient education and close follow-up [^112pGi9m] [^113JEkcf]. Wait, I need to double-check that intermittent dosing can sometimes be an intermediate step; European guidance allows intermittent regimens in selected patients, but in older adults, my default should still be to taper off completely when feasible and prioritize safer alternatives and CBT-I [^112XKYfQ].

> Let me consider special geriatric factors and comorbidities. I need to check for contributors like obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs, chronic pain, depression, circadian misalignment, and medications that impair sleep or interact via CYP3A before prescribing sedatives, and I should minimize anticholinergic burden and sedatives in Parkinson disease and dementia where possible, optimizing nonpharmacologic strategies first and reviewing all medications that affect alertness or cognition [^1133uYMz] [^1158ccDq] [^1113SJSU]. Importantly, treating insomnia with behavioral interventions may improve cognition and reduce incident depression in older adults, underscoring why I should persist with CBT-I even when medications are used adjunctively, and why I should schedule re-evaluation to de-escalate pharmacotherapy whenever possible [^116RZYu1] [^116EGjH1]. Hold on, I should verify interaction risk with orexin antagonists again; yes, CYP3A inhibitors can increase exposure, so dose selection and monitoring are critical in polypharmacy common to geriatric care [^117Hy74z].

> To make this actionable, let me outline a practical approach while I sanity-check each step. First, confirm insomnia diagnosis, characterize onset vs maintenance vs mixed, screen for sleep apnea, RLS, depression, pain, and circadian issues, and initiate CBT-I or digital CBT-I with sleep restriction and stimulus control; consider exercise as an adjunct and set expectations about time course of benefit, since sustained remission can prevent depression and improve cognition in elders [^1173F5ek] [^113auRx1] [^115aAyxy] [^116EGjH1] [^116RZYu1]. If pharmacotherapy is necessary after CBT-I has been tried or as a brief bridge, match mechanism to phenotype: for sleep-onset, prefer ramelteon or prolonged-release melatonin; for maintenance, prefer an orexin receptor antagonist; reserve Z-drugs for very short-term use when benefits outweigh risks; reserve benzodiazepines for rare, carefully selected, ultra-short courses with a predefined stop date and a fall-prevention plan, using the lowest effective dose and the shortest half-life feasible, with reassessment within 2–4 weeks and a plan to taper off [^111vt37A] [^116UfSZv] [^115ebFKm] [^114v8MUs] [^114ozjkD]. Throughout, I need to avoid trazodone, antipsychotics, first-generation antihistamines, herbal products, and cannabis for primary insomnia in older adults due to poor evidence or unfavorable risk profiles, keep CYP3A interactions in mind, and always pair medications with ongoing CBT-I to facilitate deprescribing and sustain outcomes [^112AiBos] [^115yN292] [^117WZuro] [^111G1WEx] [^117Hy74z].

In older adults with insomnia, **CBT-I is first-line** and should precede medications [^1173F5ek] [^113auRx1]. If pharmacotherapy is needed, use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, with close monitoring for falls, cognitive effects, and drug–drug interactions [^113Xs6Gk] [^112pGi9m].

- **Melatonin (prolonged-release 2 mg)**: preferred for adults ≥ 55; safe, modestly effective, and suitable for longer-term use [^112Pw3DQ] [^116UfSZv].
- **Ramelteon**: for sleep-onset insomnia; minimal next-day effects and low abuse potential [^113fHpGH] [^111vt37A].
- **Doxepin (3–6 mg)**: for sleep maintenance; low anticholinergic burden [^114X6wdZ] [^115Qdvic].
- **Orexin antagonists (e.g. suvorexant)**: for sleep maintenance; consider in selected patients after individualized risk–benefit discussion [^117Hy74z] [^115ebFKm].
- **Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, zaleplon)**: short-term use only (≤ 4 weeks) due to fall and cognitive risks [^114v8MUs] [^116ddxsV].
- **Benzodiazepines**: avoid or limit to very short-term use due to high risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and dependence [^114ozjkD] [^111u5L4j].

Avoid **antipsychotics**, **antihistamines**, and **herbal remedies** because of adverse effects or lack of efficacy [^115yN292] [^117WZuro]. Taper hypnotics slowly with **CBT-I** support to reduce withdrawal and relapse [^112pGi9m] [^113JEkcf].

Research into the sleep-wake cycle has provided new treatment targets for patients with insomnia, as well as a better understanding of how medications affect sleep processes. Insomnia medications, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, focus on enhancing sleep-promoting systems through broad antagonism of GABA. Other medications that promote sleep by blocking wake-promoting systems include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines; however, adverse effects and nonspecific therapeutic effects limit their use.

New and emerging insomnia medications are focusing on blocking wake-promoting systems via more selective antagonism of orexin, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These medications may offer improved efficacy with fewer adverse effects.

### Sedative hypnotics in older people with insomnia: Meta-analysis of risks and benefits [^111u5L4j]. BMJ (2005). Low credibility.

To quantify and compare potential benefits (subjective reports of sleep variables) and risks (adverse events and morning-after psychomotor impairment) of short-term treatment with sedative hypnotics in older people with insomnia, various sources were examined. These included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane clinical trials database, PubMed, and PsychLit, covering the period from 1966 to 2003, as well as bibliographies of published reviews and meta-analyses. Additionally, manufacturers of newer sedative hypnotics, such as zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone, were queried regarding unpublished studies.

The selection criteria focused on randomized controlled trials of any pharmacological treatment for insomnia, conducted for at least five consecutive nights in participants aged 60 or over with insomnia but otherwise free of psychiatric or psychological disorders.

A total of 24 studies, involving 2,417 participants, met the inclusion and exclusion criteria with extractable data. Findings indicated that sleep quality improved (effect size 0.14, P < 0.05), although people using any sedative reported daytime fatigue 3.82 times more often (1.88 to 7.80, P < 0.001) compared to those using a placebo.

In conclusion, while the use of sedatives led to statistically significant improvements in sleep, the magnitude of the effect was small.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116ddxsV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Z-drugs are usually prescribed as first-line pharmacological therapy for insomnia. However, the benefits and risks of Z-drugs may differ for older adults. This systematic review investigated the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of Z-drugs in the management of insomnia in older adults.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional, and observational studies using a pre-formulated search term. The target population was older adults (≥ 65 years old) with insomnia. Studies were included if they reported efficacy and/or safety outcomes of the use of Z-drugs for the management of insomnia compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other pharmacological agents.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included (8 interventional and 10 observational studies). In short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs were similarly or more efficacious in improving both sleep and daytime parameters than placebo or other pharmacological treatments, while showing good results on measures of safety. However, in longer-term observational studies, Z-drugs significantly increased the risk for falls and fractures in comparison to no treatment or melatonin agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Analyzing the evidence from short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs appear effective and safe for the treatment of insomnia in older adults, but they may have unfavorable side effects when used for longer periods of time. We, therefore, recommend carefully considering these risks when prescribing.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia [^111r6Wyb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for many types of insomnia, most notably transient insomnia associated with stress, acute illness, or jet lag. Many patients with chronic insomnia, including primary insomnia and insomnia secondary to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders, also benefit from pharmacotherapy. Relatively few individuals receive prescription medication to help them sleep, and the majority use medication for a few nights to several weeks, as opposed to continuous use for months or years.

The hypnotics available on the U.S. market today are benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). The BZRAs are efficacious in reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, reducing awakenings, and improving sleep quality without the development of tolerance in studies as long as six months. Side effects of the BZRAs are infrequent, dose-related, and linked to the sedative properties of the drug.

Sedating antidepressants are also frequently prescribed to promote sleep, despite inadequate data to support their efficacy for this indication and a greater potential for clinically troublesome side effects.

### Melatonin treatment for age-related insomnia [^115Vg1nV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Older people typically exhibit poor sleep efficiency and reduced nocturnal plasma melatonin levels. The daytime administration of oral melatonin to younger people, in doses that raise their plasma melatonin levels to the nocturnal range, can accelerate sleep onset. We examined the ability of similar physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 years old. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 minutes before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by one-week washout periods. Sleep data were obtained by polysomnography on the last three nights of each treatment period. The physiologic melatonin dose (0.3 mg) restored sleep efficiency (P < 0.0001), acting principally in the midthird of the night; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P < 0.0008) to normal. The pharmacologic dose (3.0 mg), like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), also improved sleep; however, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours. Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^112RwTwv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a major healthcare problem in the Western world. It is defined as a dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep and is associated with difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, as well as early-morning waking with an inability to return to sleep. Approximately 6 to 10% of adults experience insomnia that meets diagnostic criteria. Insomnia is more commonly experienced by older adults and can occur independently or be caused by other diseases.

Benzodiazepine-like medications (BDLM), also called Z-drugs, are a chemically heterogeneous group defined by their mechanism of action: a selectivity for certain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits that distinguishes them from benzodiazepines (BDZ).

Over the last 5 years, zolpidem has been the most frequently prescribed hypnotic worldwide. In 2017, zolpidem and zopiclone were the top two prescribed BDLMs in Europe. Various studies confirm the high prescription rate of Z-drugs in community-dwelling, hospitalized, and nursing home patients, with prescribing rates highest for older women.

BDLMs are licensed only for short-term use. This restriction entails a paradox, as the vast majority of afflicted patients are in need of long-term treatment. The time restriction on BDLM use is attributable to their effect-risk profile, where negative impact multiplies with prolonged duration of treatment and benefits decrease or remain steady at best.

BDLMs were expected to achieve the strong sedative and hypnotic effects desired while avoiding the anxiolytic, myorelaxant, analgesic, and antic effects.

The Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease suggests that in cases of insomnia, particularly for patients with Parkinson's disease, medical practitioners should review all medications. It is advised to avoid any drugs that may affect sleep or alertness or interact with other medications. This includes medications such as selegiline, H1RAs, H2RAs, antipsychotics, and sedatives, as outlined in the CNSF 2019 guidelines.

### A retrospective observational study to understand medication utilization and lines of treatment in patients with insomnia disorder [^112T8Crm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder associated with multiple health concerns. Medications for insomnia carry higher safety risks if clinical practice guidelines or monograph recommendations are not followed. This study aims to understand real-world prescribing practices among patients with insomnia in Canada, focusing on medication utilization, potentially inappropriate medication use, costs incurred, and lines of treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study utilized longitudinal drug claims data from 2018 to 2020 from the Canadian IQVIA National Private Drug Plan and Ontario Drug Benefit databases. Patients with any claims for medications approved for insomnia in Canada were identified. Four types of inappropriate medication usage were defined: (1) elevated daily dose, (2) extended duration of use for benzodiazepines (BZD) and/or Z-drugs, (3) combination use, and (4) opioid overlap with BZD and/or Z-drugs.

- **Results**: In 2019, 597,222 patients with insomnia were identified; 64% were female, with an average age of 55 years. Inappropriate medication use was noted in 52.5% of adult patients (aged 18–65 years) and 69.5% of senior patients (aged > 65 years). Extended duration was the most common inappropriate medication usage category. The annual cost of medications for insomnia was $54.8 million, and $30.3 million (55.2%) met inappropriate medication use criteria.

The high prevalence of inappropriate medication usage in insomnia raises serious safety concerns, particularly for seniors suffering from insomnia.

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^1129gFhg]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

A number of popular non-prescription treatments have demonstrated safety and varying levels of effectiveness. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, plays a fundamental role in regulating the sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythm, and melatonin-based supplements are available to manage sleep disturbances. Melatonin helps to reduce the time to fall asleep; however, there is no recommended dosage regimen for melatonin supplementation. Common side effects, such as somnolence and headaches, have been associated with the use of melatonin.

Plants or plant-derived materials have long been used to treat a range of sleep disturbances, including chamomile (Matricaria recutita), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and passionflower (Passiflora incarnata). Recent meta-analyses found conflicting results on the actual efficacy of these substances but have emphasized the lack of efficacy of most herbal components for insomnia. Some dietary supplements, such as iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, nicotinamide, B vitamins, and polyphenols, have shown some positive effect on sleep. There are still a few studies examining the relationship between micronutrient status and sleep; however, emerging evidence suggests a link between dietary micronutrient intake and sleep.

Finally, other sleep aids can improve sleep by modifying environmental factors. Body temperature is a critical determinant of both falling asleep (core body temperature drops) and staying asleep (core body temperature increases).

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^1164jWQL]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

To address poor sleep in the general population, it is important to promote sleep as a self-modifiable behavior associated with health and to increase awareness of alternative approaches with a well-rationalized strategy for improving sleep health. First-line interventions should include several non-pharmacological strategies for managing poor sleep, starting with sleep hygiene education. When appropriate, additional interventions should be considered.

- **Healthy sleep habits**: Sleep hygiene refers to a set of recommended behaviors a person can engage in throughout the day or before bedtime to promote good sleep. Habits that promote healthy sleep include abstinence from caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine late in the day; restricting bedtime activities to sleep and sex; maintaining regular sleep/wake times; modifying the bedroom environment to reduce noise and light impact; napping for less than 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon; and minimizing the use of light-emitting devices, such as smartphones, in the hour before bedtime.

There is limited empirical support for sleep hygiene recommendations as standalone interventions when offered without personalization. However, they can be a valuable resource to increase sleep awareness. Sleep hygiene education can be widely disseminated to individuals not likely to seek medical treatment and may be a more appealing and intuitive option for the general population. We encourage public health authorities in every country to develop specific programs of sleep hygiene, focusing on people who are more vulnerable, such as the elderly, teenagers, and those with mental disabilities.

### Insomnia in the elderly: A review [^112uXHyU]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Insomnia remains one of the most common sleep disorders encountered in the geriatric clinic population, frequently characterized by the subjective complaint of difficulty falling or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, producing significant daytime symptoms including difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances.

- **Methods**: A search of the literature was conducted to review the epidemiology, definition, and age-related changes in sleep, as well as factors contributing to late-life insomnia and scales utilized for the assessment of insomnia in older people. The aim is to summarize recent diagnostic guidelines and both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies for the management of insomnia in the older population.

- **Results**: Insomnia remains a clinical diagnosis. There are several demographic, psychosocial, biologic, and behavioral factors that can contribute to late-life insomnia. Older adults are at higher risk for the medical and psychiatric effects of insomnia.

- **Conclusions**: The most important aspect in the evaluation of insomnia is detailed history taking and thorough physical examination. Nonpharmacological treatment options have favorable and enduring benefits compared to pharmacological therapy.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111QPFWk]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). High credibility.

- **Method**: To be included in the present review, studies needed to 1) be a randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention designed to improve sleep; 2) produce a statistically significant effect on sleep quality when compared to a control group or an alternative treatment; 3) report a measure of mental health subsequent to the measure of sleep quality; 4) report sufficient data to compute an effect size representing the impact of the intervention on both sleep quality and mental health; 5) be written in English, or translatable using available resources. In order to reliably and validly assess the independent contribution of changes in sleep on mental health outcomes among adult populations, studies were excluded if 1) the intervention contained elements that specifically target a mental health problem in addition to elements that target sleep; or 2) recruited children and young people (i.e. < 18 years of age).

- **Search strategy**: First, we searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), Embase (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present), and The Cochrane Library (1898 to present) using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (HSSS) to identify RCTs that included terms relating to sleep quality and/or sleep disorders, and mental health. Second, the reference lists of extant reviews of the relationship between sleep and mental health were searched for any potential articles. Third, a search for any unpublished or ongoing studies was conducted.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: Causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^114AufwN]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions show promise in offsetting the adverse effects of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption. Some of the beneficial effects of these interventions may be independent of the circadian system and sleep. However, because our understanding of the range of healthy phase relationships between the SCN and peripheral clock systems is poorly characterized, clarifying these relationships could help personalize the prescription of chronobiotics, some of which still require human safety and efficacy studies. Thereafter, comparisons of these interventions are needed to evaluate which are most effective and in what circumstances.

Ultimately, we hope that mankind's historic fascination with the temporal world will continue to draw interest to the importance of the human timing system in all facets of health.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116oSMfN]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Z-drugs are usually prescribed as a first-line pharmacological therapy for insomnia. However, the benefits and risks of Z-drugs may differ for older adults. This systematic review investigated the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of Z-drugs in the management of insomnia in older adults.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional, and observational studies using a pre-formulated search term. The target population was older adults (≥ 65 years old) with insomnia. Studies were included if they reported efficacy and/or safety outcomes of the use of Z-drugs for the management of insomnia compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other pharmacological agents.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included (8 interventional and 10 observational studies). In short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs were similarly or more efficacious in improving both sleep and daytime parameters than placebo or other pharmacological treatments, while also showing favorable results on measures of safety. However, in longer-term observational studies, Z-drugs significantly increased the risk of falls and fractures in comparison to no treatment or melatonin agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Analyzing the evidence from short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs appear effective and safe for the treatment of insomnia in older adults, but they may have unfavorable side effects when used for longer periods. We, therefore, recommend caution in their long-term use.

### Effects of insomnia treatments on cognitive function: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116RZYu1]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

Globally, insomnia has been shown to impact cognitive function, which has prompted the exploration of effective treatments to enhance cognitive outcomes. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions vary in their effects, indicating that further research for optimized therapeutic strategies is needed.

- **Methods**: Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PsychInfo from database inception until August 2024 were conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled studies investigating the impacts of insomnia treatments on cognitive function. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all studies. Sensitivity analysis, publication bias, and meta-regression were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 14,829 records were retrieved, with 24 randomized controlled studies assessing the impact of insomnia treatment on cognition. Pooled analysis indicated that non-pharmacological interventions significantly enhanced cognitive function (SMD: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.04–0.49, p = 0.019), with notable improvements observed in memory (SMD: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.25–2.12, p = 0.013), attention (SMD: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15–0.50, p < 0.001), and daily living activities (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20–0.39, p < 0.001) based on self-reported measures. Longer follow-up periods were associated with more pronounced cognitive benefits (SMD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14–0.54, p = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The critical role of insomnia treatments, particularly non-pharmacological interventions, in improving cognitive function is highlighted.

### Sonata [^115GxDbw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

When sleep medicines are used every night for more than a few weeks, they may lose their effectiveness to help you sleep. This is known as "tolerance". Development of tolerance to Sonata has not been observed in outpatient clinical studies of up to 4 weeks in duration; however, it is unknown if the benefits of Sonata in falling asleep more quickly persist beyond 4 weeks. Sleep medicines should, in most cases, be used only for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days, and generally no longer than 1 or 2 weeks. If your sleep problems continue, consult your doctor, who will determine whether other measures are needed to overcome your sleep problems.

- **Dependence**: Sleep medicines can cause dependence, especially when these medicines are used regularly for longer than a few weeks or at high doses. Some people develop a need to continue taking their medicines, which is known as dependence or "addiction". When people develop dependence, they may have difficulty stopping the sleep medicine. If the medicine is suddenly stopped, the body is not able to function normally, and unpleasant symptoms (see Withdrawal) may occur. They may find that they have to keep taking the medicine either at the prescribed dose or at increasing doses just to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

All people taking sleep medicines have some risk of becoming dependent on the medicine. However, people who have been dependent on alcohol or other drugs in the past may have a higher chance of becoming addicted to sleep medicines. This possibility must be considered before using these medicines.

### Future directions in the management of insomnia [^114h2Bwd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Research on insomnia has provided a number of important new insights, but fundamental deficits in our understanding remain. In considering priorities for future research, three areas warrant immediate attention.

- **Causal relationship and adverse outcomes**: A causal relationship between insomnia and the adverse outcomes seen in insomnia patients needs to be established.

- **Optimization of symptomatic therapies**: Currently available symptomatic therapies need to be optimized. Recent data suggest that some benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce their hypnotic effect without side effects that were presumed to be inherent to sedation. Understanding the neuropharmacology underlying this differential effect would allow substantial improvements in the risk-benefit ratio for these drugs.

- **Mechanisms of insomnia**: The mechanisms of insomnia need to be better understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologic arousal is important to the clinical presentation of primary insomnia. It remains unclear, however, whether this activation is primary or secondary to the insomnia itself. If physiologic hyperarousal causes primary insomnia, it would provide new approaches to the management of this disorder.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of sleep disorders in older persons [^1113SJSU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep-related disorders are most prevalent in the older adult population. The high prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases that are more likely to develop in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders.

The goals of this article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care practices.

- **Background and significance**: The article begins with a discussion on the importance of understanding the prevalence and impact of sleep disorders in older adults.

- **General review of sleep**: This section provides a comprehensive overview of sleep mechanisms and disturbances that commonly affect older individuals.

- **Recommendations development**: A detailed explanation of how the recommendations were formulated is provided, using evidence from research and expert consensus.

- **General approach to detecting sleep disorders in an ambulatory setting**: Strategies for identifying sleep disorders in clinical practice are outlined.

The text then presents overviews of specific sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, parasomnias, hypersomnias, and sleep disorders in long-term care settings. Evidence- and expert-based recommendations, developed by a group of experts, follow these overviews.

### Non-pharmacological management of primary and secondary insomnia among older people: Review of assessment tools and treatments [^117H5CGa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary insomnia, especially among older adults, is frequently encountered by family physicians. Pharmacological interventions, although effective in some circumstances, can be detrimental in others. Non-pharmacological management of insomnia may allow the patients to self-administer the treatment.

- **Objectives**: Review of published literature of assessment tools and treatments for primary and secondary insomnia.

- **Results**: Two frequently used self-reporting methods for obtaining sleep data are sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A large amount of research supports the use of non-pharmacological treatments such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, multi-component therapy, and paradoxical intention.

- **Conclusion**: Assessing the nature of insomnia by using an effective assessment tool and providing patients with a non-pharmacological treatment should be the first intervention for insomnia. It is shown that non-pharmacological treatments for primary and secondary insomnia are feasible and effective alternatives to the use of benzodiazepines, and that family physicians should consider these when managing older patients with insomnia.

### Special considerations in insomnia diagnosis and management: Depressed, elderly, and chronic pain populations [^115V3mzT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with insomnia who also have chronic pain, depression, or who are elderly represent segments of the population that are particularly difficult to treat. These populations tend to be at higher risk for experiencing difficulty sleeping and are more likely to experience chronic insomnia, sleep maintenance problems, and/or nonrestorative sleep. Worsening insomnia may exacerbate other somatic and psychological symptoms and vice versa. Conversely, there is evidence that appropriate recognition and management of the sleep complaint may alleviate other symptoms related to the associated condition and help interrupt this vicious cycle.

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116NEnff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Current concepts in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders in the elderly [^1166bRKp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are a pervasive problem throughout all patient populations but represent an especially important health issue for the elderly. Alterations in sleep architecture that occur as a part of normal aging contribute to sleep problems as we grow older. Other contributing factors, including comorbid medical conditions, changes in lifestyle and schedule, and altered circadian rhythms, among others, can have detrimental effects on the health of the elderly. Coupled with a number of sleep disorders that either emerge or exacerbate with age, the effects of poor sleep often result in an overall worsening of quality of life. Treatment options can be unique in this population and often more difficult due to the effects of normal aging, as well as polypharmacy and possible medication interactions. This article focuses on the common sleep disorders that can besiege this population, symptoms to aid in diagnosis, and specific treatment options to help improve quality of life in the elderly.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: A structured literature review [^112Mxcu3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by continuing cognitive decline and memory loss; it accounts for 60% to 80% of dementia cases in adults over 65 years of age. With an aging global population, the AD population is expected to triple over the next 40 years to over 13 million cases.

AD is associated with significant healthcare costs and resource utilization, particularly when patients require admission to care facilities. The behavioral symptoms of dementia, including disturbed sleep, nighttime awakenings, and wanderings, place a substantial burden on family and caregivers, leading to the early institutionalization of AD patients.

Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep among individuals with adequate opportunity to sleep and is associated with daytime consequences, such as an inability to perform daily activities. Insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbances (collectively referred to in this manuscript as sleep problems) increase with age and are common in AD patients, with a prevalence of over 50%. AD patients also experience more severe symptoms of insomnia and sleep disturbances, such as increased sleep latency and reduced sleep maintenance, as well as progressive deterioration and instability of circadian rhythms, compared to older adults without AD. Moreover, insomnia is also a risk factor for AD, and a bidirectional relationship is thought to exist between poor sleep and AD pathology.

Despite the high prevalence and substantial disease burden of insomnia in AD patients, including high associated healthcare costs and caregiver burden, there is limited evidence on effective treatment options for this population. Further research is needed to explore therapeutic strategies that can mitigate sleep problems in these patients and improve their overall quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1166NBwH]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The study identified a total of 542 records through database searches, with an additional 33 records located via other sources, such as hand searches of reference lists from included studies. After the removal of 26 duplicates, a total of 549 records were screened, leading to the exclusion of 500 records on the basis of title and abstract scrutiny. Subsequently, 49 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, resulting in the exclusion of 31 records. The primary reasons for exclusion were incorrect population age, inappropriate study design, and unsuitable publication type. A comprehensive list of excluded studies, along with the rationales for their exclusion, is included as Additional File 2.

- **PRISMA flow diagram**: The PRISMA flow diagram is depicted in Fig. 1.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^114pVyLM]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Late-life depression, defined as major depressive disorder in adults aged 60 years and older, has a 12-month prevalence exceeding 10% among community-dwelling older adults. It is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, disability, medical comorbidity, and all-cause mortality, with the highest suicide rates observed in older men. However, diagnosis and treatment for depression in this demographic are often inadequate. Even with treatment, only about one-third achieve remission, leaving an estimated disease burden of 60%. Hence, effective depression prevention is urgently needed. This need is particularly pronounced among community-dwelling older adults, a group that accounts for nearly 20% of the US population, as they are highly vulnerable to depression and report the lowest use of mental health services.

Insomnia affects nearly 50% of individuals aged 60 years or older and contributes to a twofold increased risk of major depression. While pharmacotherapy is commonly used to treat insomnia, its effects are only temporary and come with risks of daytime drowsiness and dependency. Nonpharmacologic treatments for insomnia include sleep education therapy (SET), a behavioral program addressing daily habits and environmental factors leading to poor sleep. Another nonpharmacological option is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which integrates cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation techniques. CBT-I is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder.

### Insomnia (primary) in older people: Non-drug treatments [^113DsqLR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Up to 40% of older adults experience insomnia, characterized by difficulty getting to sleep, early waking, or feeling unrefreshed upon waking. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Additional risk factors include psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aimed at answering the following clinical question: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for primary insomnia in older adults (aged 60 years and older)? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), exercise programs, and timed exposure to bright light.

### The assessment and management of insomnia: An update [^112xjy2k]. World Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, psychiatric and physical morbidity, and accidents. As such, it is important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. This paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options. These options include both non-medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, "z-drugs", melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non-selective antihistamines.

A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are an array of interventions which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with these features and whose risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized. These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence-based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, with the aim of providing a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^117Hf3YP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care in an attempt to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to that of a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward this personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with the mechanism of action.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1153tfWY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

In the randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a total of 1,902 individuals participated. All studies focused on participants older than 65 years, with the percentage of male participants ranging from 19.2% to 45.6%. Ethnicities were reported in four trials, with participants ranging in number from 44 to 549, and study durations varying from 2 weeks to 18 weeks. Four trials detailed comorbid conditions, while co-medication was noted in five studies, and cognitive examination was performed in five trials. All RCTs aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BDLM either against a placebo, BDZ, or both.

Four RCTs took place in the US, with others conducted in Sweden, Canada, Germany, and a joint study in France and Belgium. Six studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies; for the other two, sponsorship information was not available.

One retrospective cohort study analyzed in this review included participants older than 70 years, with up to 60% being female. The study involved 156,987 participants taking BDLM to examine the risk of accidental events. Data collection spanned 3 months, following a period of at least 3 months without a prescription claim for insomnia medication. While it provided information on comorbidities and co-medication, it did not offer data on physical or cognitive examinations. This study was conducted in the US from 2000 to 2006.

The analysis also included five case-control and four case-crossover studies. In total, [text was cut off and ended mid-sentence].

### Medical cannabis for the treatment of insomnia [^115nqXGH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Addressing insomnia is crucial, as it affects 6% to 10% of the adult population, with a higher prevalence in older adults and those with medical or psychiatric conditions. Insomnia significantly impacts individual health and quality of life and imposes a heavy burden on healthcare systems through increased emergency and office visits, prescription drug costs, and indirect costs like work absenteeism and reduced productivity. Additionally, insomnia is associated with anxiety or depression, lack of impulse control, substance abuse, hypertension, heart failure, and pain, among other conditions.

Conventional treatments for insomnia, while effective, often come with adverse effects such as dependence, tolerance, and cognitive impairment, which limit their long-term use. This has led to a growing interest in alternative treatments, including medical cannabis (MC). Studies show that MC can potentially improve sleep quality, with some reports highlighting its benefits. However, its use remains controversial due to legal and safety concerns and the lack of robust evidence supporting its efficacy and safety for insomnia.

This question is especially topical given the increasing legalization and prescriptions of MC worldwide. Although not yet included in the American guideline for managing insomnia and identified as an area lacking sufficient evidence in the European guideline, the use of MC for insomnia has become increasingly intriguing in recent years. This interest has prompted the development of several research trials aimed at exploring its potential.

### Insomnia in the elderly: cause, approach, and treatment [^111LwR3Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent problem in late life. Sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a subjective report of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite adequate opportunity to sleep. More than 50% of elderly people have insomnia; however, it is typically undertreated, and nonpharmacologic interventions are underused by health care practitioners. This article reviews the causes of insomnia in the elderly, the approach to patient evaluation, and the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of insomnia.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^116EGjH1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Older adults with insomnia face a high risk of developing major depression, and there is an urgent need for prevention strategies specifically targeting this demographic. This study aims to investigate whether treating insomnia with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), as opposed to sleep education therapy (SET), can prevent major depressive disorder in older adults.

This assessor-blinded, parallel-group, single-site randomized clinical trial involved a community-based sample of 431 individuals, with 291 adults aged 60 years or older qualifying for enrollment. All participants had insomnia disorder but did not experience major depression or significant health events in the past year. Recruitment took place from July 1, 2012, to April 30, 2015. Initially set for 24 months, the follow-up period was extended to 36 months, concluding in July 2018, with data analyzed from March 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2 months of CBT-I (n = 156) or 2 months of SET (n = 135).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the time to onset of major depressive disorder, diagnosed via interviews and based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria. The secondary outcome was the sustained remission of insomnia disorder before any depressive episode or throughout the follow-up.

- **Results**: The study included 291 randomized participants, with a mean age of 70.1 years (SD = 6.7). Among them, 168 were female (57.7%). Racial demographics included 7 Asian (2.4%), 32 Black (11.0%), 3 Pacific Islander (1.0%), 241 White (82.8%), 6 multiracial (2.1%), and 2 other (0.7%).

Overall, the trial provides important insights into the prevention of depression through insomnia treatment in older populations.

### Long-term health conditions and their impact on people with sleep disturbances and dementia [^112xSVvG]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Carers discussed the dilemmas they faced in terms of medications prescribed to their relatives, both for sleep and for pain and other long-term conditions (LTCs). They highlighted that medication for dementia, sleep, and LTCs often does not help or produces side effects. Carers felt they bore the responsibility of weighing the risks and benefits of medications, especially for medications prescribed 'as needed', particularly for painkillers, as this son explained:

"It does help her get off to sleep for a few hours. But I notice that if she has it for two or three days running… her daytime behaviour just changes. She becomes more confused. She's looking a bit more lost… Last night, I didn't give her any medication at all because I saw that she was a bit confused. I thought I'm going to give her a couple of days off. But then, you know, I have a night which is just absolutely terrible. And I'm exhausted".

The challenge of weighing the relative risks and benefits of medication for pain was exacerbated by people with dementia being unable to clearly recognize or communicate their level of pain. Carers reported receiving conflicting advice from doctors, so they felt they had to make the decision themselves based on trial and error. One daughter explained that despite receiving professional advice regarding pain management for her mother's pain, she chose not to follow it for fear of her mother becoming addicted to painkillers. This potentially left the pain untreated, impacting her mother's sleep.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113RxE49]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Workshop members noted the high demand for sleep medications from caregivers, surrogates, and patients, together with the common misperception that sedation is equivalent to sleep. Bedside clinicians express a strong desire for a safe and effective sleep aid, particularly in patients with concomitant delirium. However, the study of pharmacologic options to promote nighttime sleepiness is limited by small trial sizes, the failure to enroll mechanically ventilated adults with a high severity of illness, and an overreliance on delirium reduction and/or patient-reported sleep quality to define efficacy.

In addition, RCTs have so far involved the prescribing of pharmacologic agents upon ICU admission or timed in relation to specific clinical events (e.g. surgical procedures). In practice, though, clinicians are frequently seeking options to promote sleep after patients report sleep disruption or have already presented with delirium. This discrepancy raises important questions regarding the timing and patient selection for pharmaceutical interventions. Interestingly, pharmacologic therapies to promote daytime wakefulness in the ICU have not been rigorously studied, and this may be a novel and effective approach to sleep promotion in the ICU. Finally, we should continue to consider the sleep and circadian implications of medications routinely used in the ICU, such as corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, narcotics, and antipsychotics.

### Diagnosis and management of insomnia in older people [^116beeU3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common but underrecognized problem in elderly patients. Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia.

- **Step 1**: Ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit, which can significantly aid in detecting patients with insomnia.
- **Step 2**: Perform an initial evaluation of the problem, considering symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function.
- **Step 3**: Determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare, and in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment for a full evaluation of the problem.
- **Step 4**: Conduct a sleep evaluation, focusing mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely play a role.
- **Step 5**: Intervention is the final step. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia. Hypnotics can be used for treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions.

Pharmacological therapy generally includes benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon. The use of these agents is limited by a lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the main symptoms of insomnia among older people. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.

### Advances in the management of chronic insomnia [^111CXbcd]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic insomnia is a common condition that affects people worldwide and negatively impacts patients' health and well-being. The treatment of insomnia can be complex and time-consuming for both patients and providers. Although behavioral interventions are the first-line therapy, there are barriers to accessing these treatments. However, in recent years, alternative ways to provide these behavioral therapies, making them more widely available, have been investigated. Drugs also play an important role in treating insomnia, with new medications introduced as options for those with sleep initiation and sleep maintenance insomnia. This review discusses advances over the past six years in both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for patients with chronic insomnia. It also addresses the controversies surrounding some of the drug treatments and explores the role of technology and personal activity monitoring devices in treating insomnia.

### Diagnosing and treating insomnia in adults and older adults [^112wqjVm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep-wake disorder, affects 6% to 10% of adults and may result in interpersonal and occupational problems, significantly impacting quality of life. Patients may experience difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, or both. Insomnia disorder frequently coexists with psychiatric, medical, and neurologic disorders, forming bidirectional relationships with these conditions. Diagnosis should rely on patient interviews, assessment tools, and established criteria.

- **Selection of treatment**: Consider efficacy for the patient's specific complaint, along with safety profile and abuse liability.
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia**: Recommended as first-line treatment by guidelines; however, some patients may be unable or unwilling to try it or may not respond.
- **Older adults with insomnia disorder**: Medications' risk-benefit profiles require careful consideration.

These factors are essential in managing insomnia effectively.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^116yQhoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia, with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems include an increased number and duration of awakenings and an increased percentage of light sleep. Sleep disturbances are associated with numerous problems for people with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In people with dementia, sleep disturbances may lead to worsening cognitive symptoms, challenging behaviors such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms, such as accidental falls. Additionally, sleep disturbances contribute to significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to the institutionalization of people with dementia. As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesize research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. Given that interventions are often complex, consisting of more than one active component, and implemented in complex contexts, identifying effective intervention components may be challenging.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non-pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was conducted on January 13, 2022.

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder. The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

- **Data sources**: Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

- **Study selection**: 35 randomized, controlled trials of at least four weeks' duration were evaluated. These trials analyzed pharmacotherapies available in the United States and reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies reported harm information. FDA review data was collected for non-benzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists, along with product labels for all agents.

- **Data extraction**: Data was extracted by a single investigator and confirmed by a second reviewer; a dual-investigator assessment evaluated risk of bias, with consensus determining strength of evidence.

- **Data synthesis**: Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, as well as most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia.

### Race differences in the association between sleep medication use and risk of dementia [^111Aa1yG]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

The effect of sleep medications on cognition in older adults is controversial, possibly dependent upon sleep quality, and may differ by race.

- **Objective**: To determine the longitudinal association between sleep medication use and incident dementia over 15 years, and to explore whether the association is independent of nighttime sleep disturbances and if it differs by race.

- **Methods**: We examined 3,068 community-dwelling older adults (aged 74.1 ± 2.9 years, 41.7% Black, 51.5% female) without dementia. Sleep medication use was recorded three times by asking, "Do you take sleeping pills or other medications to help you sleep?" with the response options: "Never (0)", "Rarely (≤ 1/month)", "Sometimes (2–4/month)", "Often (5–15/month)", or "Almost Always (16–30/month)". Incident dementia was defined using hospitalization records, dementia medication prescriptions, or a clinically significant decline in global cognition.

- **Results**: 138 (7.71%) of Whites and 34 (2.66%) of Blacks reported taking sleep medications "often or almost always". Whites were almost twice as likely to take all prescription hypnotics. 617 participants developed dementia over the follow-up. After adjustment for all covariates, participants who reported taking sleep medications ≥ 5/month versus ≤ 1/month were significantly more likely to develop dementia, and the association was only observed among Whites (HR = 1.79, 1.21–2.66) but not Blacks (HR = 0.84, 0.38–1.83); p for interaction = 0.048. Further adjustment for nighttime sleep did not appreciably alter the results. The association was similar for the cumulative frequency of sleep medication use.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for the treatment of chronic insomnia in adults when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that…

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic insomnia in adults [^113Vj2DN]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder in the general population and is commonly encountered in medical practice. It is defined as the subjective perception of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep and results in some form of daytime impairment. Insomnia may present with a variety of specific complaints and etiologies, making the evaluation and management of chronic insomnia demanding on a clinician's time.

The purpose of this clinical guideline is to provide clinicians with a practical framework for the assessment and disease management of chronic adult insomnia, using existing evidence-based insomnia practice parameters where available, and consensus-based recommendations to bridge areas where such parameters do not exist. Unless otherwise stated, "insomnia" refers to chronic insomnia, which is present for at least a month, as opposed to acute or transient insomnia, which may last days to weeks.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^111uMEt1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

- **Question**: Does treatment of insomnia prevent depression in community-dwelling adults 60 years or older without depression but with insomnia?

- **Findings**: In this randomized clinical trial of 291 adults aged 60 years or older with insomnia disorder, 2 months of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) resulted in a decreased likelihood of incident and recurrent depression during 36 months of follow-up compared with an active comparator control, sleep education therapy. Sustained insomnia remission in adults undergoing CBT-I resulted in a decreased likelihood of depression versus no insomnia remission in adults receiving sleep education therapy.

- **Meaning**: Treatment of insomnia may be beneficial in the prevention of depression in older adults.
