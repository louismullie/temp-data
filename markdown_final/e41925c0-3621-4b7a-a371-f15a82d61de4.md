## Question

Checklist for a case of animal bite

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step checklist for managing animal bites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and triage. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that drive risk stratification. Next, I will examine the physical exam with attention to high-risk anatomic sites and structural injuries. After that, I need to check wound care priorities, including irrigation, debridement, and closure decisions. Then, I will review antibiotic prophylaxis versus treatment thresholds and agent selection. I should confirm tetanus and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis indications and logistics. I will now examine special exposures such as snakes, bats, and ticks. Finally, I need to ensure documentation, follow-up, and patient education are addressed, and I will double-check any areas where guidelines conflict or where I might be overgeneralizing.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and hemorrhage control, with early attention to anaphylaxis and severe pain, because airway compromise from facial bites or systemic reactions can be rapidly fatal, and tourniquets should be avoided for envenomation due to ischemic harm, even though I initially thought a tourniquet might help bleeding control. Wait, let me verify that guidance, and yes, tourniquets are not recommended in snakebite first aid, so I should correct that impulse and emphasize immobilization and rapid transport instead [^115hWaqN] [^1139L4ef] [^116qPyXd].

> Next, I should review the focused history to stratify risk: animal species and behavior, domestic versus stray or wild status, timing of exposure, provoked versus unprovoked, vaccination status of the animal when known, patient comorbidities and immunization history, and geographic context for rabies and envenomation risk. I need to ensure I ask about tetanus and rabies vaccination status explicitly because that will change management today, and I should confirm that rabies risk varies by species and region, with bats and unvaccinated dogs or cats carrying the highest concern in many settings [^111b3yDd] [^116MHbsi] [^112t3coq] [^117U71xP].

> I will now examine the wound carefully, documenting location, depth, puncture versus laceration, devitalized tissue, foreign bodies, and especially any involvement of hands, face, joints, tendons, bone, or neurovascular structures. Hold on, I should verify that hand bites have higher infection risk and that injuries to tendons, joints, or bone warrant surgical consultation, which they do, and I should also remember that apparently "minor" puncture wounds can hide deep structural damage, particularly with cats [^114HTnXm] [^111qxQys] [^112mVfHi].

> Let me think about wound care next, because meticulous irrigation and debridement are the cornerstones to reduce infection. Copious high-pressure irrigation with saline and careful removal of devitalized tissue are essential, and I should double-check that this is consistently recommended across trauma and infectious disease guidance, which it is, including for mammalian bites and contaminated wounds [^111ZTZw7] [^113Xs2eU] [^112mVfHi].

> On closure, I should confirm the balance of infection risk versus cosmesis: primary closure is generally avoided in high-risk wounds but may be considered for low-risk dog bites after thorough irrigation and debridement, whereas facial wounds are often closed primarily with preemptive antibiotics due to cosmetic importance. Wait, I should verify the strength of evidence, and yes, IDSA supports primary closure for facial bites with irrigation and preemptive antibiotics, while allowing approximation of other wounds with weaker support, and AAFP suggests selective primary closure for low-risk dog bites [^111uNx3y] [^111smVvu] [^114wZCqa].

> Now, antibiotics: I need to ensure I do not overprescribe routine prophylaxis. Current trauma and surgical infection guidance advises against routine prophylaxis for mammalian bites and supports case-by-case decisions, whereas IDSA and AAFP recommend preemptive therapy for high-risk wounds or hosts. Let me reconcile this by focusing on high-risk features such as hand involvement, puncture wounds, delayed presentation beyond roughly 8–12 hours, immunocompromise, moderate to severe injuries, or penetration of periosteum or joint capsule, where the benefit is clearer [^114nrpNG] [^113V7oNq] [^114UcFAC] [^1151yZdu].

> If antibiotics are indicated, I should confirm first-line therapy: amoxicillin-clavulanate is preferred for its coverage of Pasteurella, streptococci, staphylococci including some MRSA risk, and anaerobes. For penicillin allergy, I need to check alternatives such as doxycycline or moxifloxacin with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage, and I should avoid macrolides due to variable Pasteurella activity. I should double-check duration, and 3–5 days is reasonable for prophylaxis, extending if infection develops [^111uLr8V] [^114UcFAC] [^113KHevu].

> For established infection, I should verify that cultures are warranted in severe cases and that empiric therapy must cover polymicrobial flora. IDSA recommends obtaining cultures for erysipelas or cellulitis from animal bites and using agents active against aerobes and anaerobes, with escalation based on culture results and clinical response [^114mbgxG] [^111uLr8V].

> Tetanus prophylaxis is next. I need to check the wound classification and vaccination history: for dirty wounds, give a booster if more than 5 years have elapsed since the last dose, and for clean wounds, if more than 10 years. If the primary series is incomplete or unknown, give both tetanus vaccine and tetanus immune globulin, and I should prefer Tdap over Td if not previously given [^113BmGCo] [^116Me3WA] [^113G6uSZ].

> Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis requires careful risk assessment by species, geography, and animal availability for observation. I should confirm that PEP is indicated for bites from animals with unknown or positive rabies risk, with HRIG plus vaccine given promptly, and that local public health should be consulted for jurisdictional protocols. Hold on, I should verify that bats are high risk even without a clear bite, and yes, any bat exposure warrants PEP evaluation in the United States [^111b3yDd] [^112t3coq] [^11357mh3].

> Special exposures deserve tailored pathways: for snakebite, I need to ensure no tourniquets, prioritize immobilization and rapid transport, and administer antivenom for systemic toxicity or severe local effects. I should double-check that antivenom dosing is product- and region-specific and that repeat dosing is guided by clinical and laboratory response, including the 20-minute whole blood clotting test where available [^1139L4ef] [^111vseKs] [^115hWaqN].

> For bat exposures, I should confirm that even unclear or minor contacts warrant PEP because cryptic exposures account for many human rabies cases, and I need to ensure the patient understands that observation of the bat is not a substitute for PEP when exposure cannot be ruled out [^11357mh3] [^112t3coq].

> For tick bites, I need to check prophylaxis criteria strictly: only consider a single dose of doxycycline within 72 hours for high-risk bites from Ixodes in an endemic area with attachment for at least 36 hours, and otherwise manage with observation. I should also confirm that testing the tick is not recommended and that mechanical removal with tweezers is the correct approach [^115Kk5NG] [^116wF6wB] [^1126hBCD].

> I should confirm that imaging is reserved for suspected foreign body, retained tooth fragment, joint or bone involvement, or when infection is suspected. Routine imaging is unnecessary for simple superficial bites, but a high index of suspicion is warranted for hand injuries and deep punctures [^112mVfHi] [^1173WVi2].

> Documentation must be meticulous: I need to record the animal species and circumstances, wound measurements and classification, neurovascular status, immunization history, treatments provided, and the rationale for antibiotics, tetanus, and rabies decisions. I should also notify public health or animal control as indicated and provide clear return precautions for evolving infection, neurologic deficits, or systemic symptoms [^112t3coq] [^112mVfHi].

> Follow-up should be within 24–48 hours for high-risk wounds to reassess for infection, with earlier review for immunocompromised patients. I need to ensure the patient knows signs of infection such as increasing pain, erythema, swelling, purulence, fever, or red streaking, and I should arrange surgical consultation for any signs of deep space infection, tenosynovitis, or osteomyelitis [^112mVfHi] [^111qxQys].

> Patient education should emphasize immediate wound cleansing with soap and water for future bites, prompt medical evaluation for deep or hand bites, and the importance of completing tetanus and rabies series if started. I should also counsel on animal behavior risk reduction and, where relevant, pre-exposure rabies vaccination for high-risk travelers or occupational exposures [^112mVfHi] [^114TXuiA].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overgeneralized closure rules. While many sources discourage routine primary closure, selective closure of low-risk dog bites after thorough irrigation and debridement is reasonable, and facial wounds are a notable exception where primary closure with preemptive antibiotics is favored for cosmesis. I need to ensure shared decision-making when evidence is weak [^114wZCqa] [^111uNx3y] [^111smVvu].

> Finally, I need to ensure that my antibiotic stewardship aligns with contemporary guidance: avoid routine prophylaxis for low-risk bites, target prophylaxis to high-risk wounds or hosts, and escalate to therapeutic regimens with culture guidance when infection is present. This balances modest absolute risk reductions in some subgroups against the harms of overtreatment [^114nrpNG] [^114UcFAC] [^111uLr8V].

### First step in assessment of vipGrade, a computerized clinical decision system to assessenvenomation grading: a single-center interrater reliability study [^111mUvT4]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of Vipera spp. snakebite cases registered by the PCC of Bordeaux, France, between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, evaluating the agreement between VipGrade ® assessments, toxicologists' assessments, and current guidelines.

Results

133 patients with Vipera aspis snakebites were included. There was 100% agreement in severity grading by PCC guidelines and VipGrade ®. However, grading by toxicologists and VipGrade ® diverged in 19 cases (85% agreement; κ = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.87).

Conclusions

The VipGrade ® tool's grading reflects current PCC guidelines, which are authoritative in France, and may allow for a more rapid and standardized determination of management and follow-up of viper-bitten patients. It should be noted, however, that the more complex and dynamic aspects of management are not included in VipGrade ®. Its purpose is to supplement, not replace, the advice of the PCC's clinical toxicologists, and this advice should be sought whenever a viper bite is encountered in clinical practice.

### Animal bites… [^116RCQKs]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Cat bites and, to a lesser extent, dog bites may cause infections with Pasteurella multocida, while human bites may cause infections with anaerobes and Eikenella corrodensbut can also transmit hepatitis and HIV. Risk factors for infection include cat and human bites, location of bite, puncture wounds, and 24-hour or longer delay in seeking treatment. Bites that appear superficial and harmless may be associated with significant underlying tissue injury. Meticulous cleaning with extensive irrigation with sterile saline is the cornerstone of management of a bite. Primary wound closure is contraindicated in infected wounds and lacerations of the hand. Antibiotics are indicated for infected wounds, human bites, bites on hands, and presentation after 24 hours. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium is drug of choice with cephalosporins or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plusclindamycin in those allergic to penicillin.

If animal is unavailable for rabies virus analysis, complete the full series of rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin.

### Core outcome set for intervention research on snakebite envenomation in south Asia [^1116ziqq]. Injury Prevention (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2019 WHO strategy to reduce snakebite burden emphasises the need for fostering research on snakebite treatments. A core outcome set (COS) is a consensus minimal list of outcomes that should be measured in research on a particular condition. We aimed to develop a COS for snakebite research in South Asia, the region with the highest burden.

Methods

We used data from a systematic review of outcomes to develop a long list of outcomes which were rated in two rounds of online Delphi survey with healthcare providers, patients and the public, and potential COS users to develop a COS for intervention research on snakebite treatments in South Asia for five intervention groups. Subsequently, meetings, consultations and workshops were organised to reach further consensus. We defined the consensus criteria a priori.

Results

Overall, 72 and 61 people, including patients and the public, participated in round I and round II of the Delphi, respectively. Consensus COSs (including definition and time points) were developed for interventions that prevent adverse reaction to snake antivenom (three outcomes), specifically manage neurotoxic manifestations (five outcomes), specifically manage haematological manifestations (five outcomes) and those that act against snake venom (seven) outcomes. A priori criteria for inclusion in COS were not met for COS on interventions for management of the bitten part.

Conclusion

The COS contributes to improving research efficiency by standardising outcome measurement in South Asia. It also provides methodological insights for future development of COS, beyond snakebite.

Education into practice

Think about the last time you treated a patient with snakebite. Reflect on the challenges you encountered while diagnosing and treating envenoming. What changes, if any, might you make to your approach next time?
How do you review a snakebite patient as an outpatient discharge? Think about common persisting physical and psychological problems that you might have noticed during review. To what extent was the patient able to share difficulties in returning to routine life? How might you involve the patient in making decisions about long term?

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114UcFAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite wounds — preemptive antimicrobial therapy and rabies prophylaxis: Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who (a) are immunocompromised, (b) are asplenic, (c) have advanced liver disease, (d) have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, (e) have moderate to severe injuries, especially to the hand or face, or (f) have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if rabies prophylaxis should be initiated (strong, low). Numerous studies have failed to definitively determine who should receive early, preemptive therapy, so the decision to give "prophylactic" antibiotics should be based on wound severity and host immune competence. Prophylactic or early preemptive therapy seems to provide marginal benefit for patients with dog bites who present within 12–24 hours after injury, particularly in low-risk wounds. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials of dog bite wounds found a cumulative incidence of infection of 16%, with a relative risk of infection in patients treated with antibiotics compared with controls to be 0.56. Amoxicillin-clavulanate administered in one study to patients with full-thickness animal bites presenting > 9 hours after the bite resulted in a lower infection rate. A Cochrane review supported limiting prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites to hand injuries and human bites, but the 8 studies had limitations including small numbers (range, 12–190), failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis (4 of 8 studies), and unspecified method of randomization (4 of 8 studies).

What are the implications for public health practice?

Public health officials at the local, state, and national levels should work closely with non–health-care entities that receive public inquiries concerning wildlife to establish a standard referral process and regularly scheduled training about rabies risks. The diagnosis of rabies should be considered in patients hospitalized with progressive encephalopathy when other causes cannot be found or with a known history of animal exposure. This can lead to earlier adoption of staffing and infection control measures to decrease the number of health-care workers exposed to infectious body fluids or tissue for whom rabies postexposure prophylaxis might subsequently need to be provided.

Bat exposure in the home was the likely source of infection in this case. Over 90% of domestically acquired human rabies cases reported in United States since 1995 have been linked epidemiologically to bats. Cryptogenic human rabies (i.e. cases where a definitive history of animal exposure is lacking) constitutes an increasing proportion of these bat-associated cases. Rabies virus transmission can occur from seemingly minor or unrecognized bites. A complete rabies virus exposure risk assessment is recommended for any person reporting potential exposure to a bat, even in the absence of a documented bite.

The patient in this case sought information on bat removal but was not advised of the health risks associated with bat exposures. Lack of referral to guidance concerning health risks associated with bats living in the home was possibly a missed opportunity to prevent rabies infection. Because authority over wildlife management and animal bite reporting varies among states, citizens might reach out to diverse entities, including public health, animal control, law enforcement, or wildlife agencies, as initial points of contact for bat concerns. Provision of training, educational resources, and expert consultation to agencies, institutions, and organizations that provide assistance with wildlife concerns is a valuable public health service. Such service requires strong partnerships and clear communication among public health officials and diverse community partners.

Human rabies is preventable by avoiding contact with animal vectors and by receiving prompt and appropriate wound care and PEP after a suspected rabies virus exposure. Public health officials should work closely with non–health-care partners that receive public inquiries concerning wildlife to establish a standard referral process and regularly scheduled training about rabies risks. The public should also be educated about the risk for rabies from bat exposures, and options for the safe removal and exclusion of bats from human dwellings.

A bite from a venomous snake is a medical emergency involving not only the affected site but also multiple organ systems. Rapid transport of a snakebite victim to a medical facility is paramount. Management decisions must be based on close clinical monitoring of the potentially erratic envenomation syndrome. Because of the many variables inherent in the management of snakebite victims, consultation with a physician specialist is recommended.

### Camel bites: a case study with a summary of current epidemiology, injury patterns, and treatment modalities [^115S4bVS]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Animal bites are a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, the majority of animal bites come from domestic pets, including dogs, cats, and rodents. Camel bites, on the other hand, are exceedingly rare in the United States and are poorly described in the western medical literature. Special considerations must be made when camel bite injuries occur, as they may be therapeutically challenging. Although some clinical features of camel bites resemble those of the more common animal bite injuries, the camel's unique dentition and bite force must be taken into account when managing these wounds.

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^111vJnea]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Animals in healthcare facilities — approval and animal requirements for patient pet visitation — Healthcare facilities that permit a single pet visitation to a patient should adopt the following practices: Approval should be obtained from IPC and the patient's attending physician and nurse, and approval for the visit should be included in the medical record with details about the animal and the person(s) responsible for the animal's transport and care. Visitation should be restricted to dogs, and animals should be at least 1 year of age and housebroken; younger animals could be considered on a case-by-case basis. Written information must be provided to the owner/designee specifying visit details, including the maximum duration of visitation of one hour. The owner or guardian of the animal is responsible to supervise the animal at all times, prevent contact with other individuals, promptly clean any fecal or urine accidents, supervise the visitation process, and report any events (eg, bite, scratch) to HCP.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^115hWaqN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Snake bite — recommendation-specific supportive text emphasizes access to definitive care and minimizing exertion. The definitive treatment for snakebite is antivenom, which is not available for use in the first aid setting, and it is not practical to treat shock, internal bleeding, or severe neurotoxicity in the first aid setting; therefore, a person bitten by a snake that is venomous or might be venomous should seek prompt medical attention and transport by EMS allows delivery of supportive and stabilizing care before arrival at the hospital. A pit viper bite typically deposits venom intradermally or into the subcutaneous space, and in a human experimental study, flow of an intradermally or subcutaneously injected radiotracer increased when the subject walked for ≥ 10 minutes, which could lead to increased systemic absorption of venom.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111ECh8k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

Primary care physicians must be able to recognize wrist and hand injuries that require immediate attention. A complete history and physical examination, including assessment of distal limb function, are essential. Hemorrhage control is necessary in patients with vessel lacerations and amputations. Amputations require an understanding of the indications and contraindications in the management of the amputated limb. High-pressure injection injuries and compartment syndromes require a high index of suspicion for early recognition. Infectious entities include "fight bite", open fractures, purulent tenosynovitis, animal bites, and retained foreign bodies. Tendon disruptions should be recognized early to optimize management.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^114jvGwU]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

As articulated by Kofi Annan, "Snakebite is the biggest public health crisis you have likely never heard of". Snakebites cause an estimated 1·8 million envenomings and 94 000 deaths each year, with the highest burden in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. On June 9, 2017, the WHO classified snakebite as a priority neglected tropical disease, and since then increased funding has been allocated by major donors. The need to standardise outcome measure reporting is crucial, particularly given the pipeline of snakebite therapeutics with multispecies specificity, which will require clinical trial assessment across multiple regions. Standardisation of reporting of allergic reactions to antivenom products is essential.

A core outcome measurement set provides a list of outcome measures to be reported in all clinical trials in a disease area. The core outcome measurement set does not preclude trialists from selecting primary, secondary, or safety outcome measures that are not in the core set. Snakebite presents a unique challenge as different snake species cause diverse clinical syndromes.

In preparation for developing the core outcome measurement set, a systematic review was done. Over 40 randomised controlled trials have been undertaken, although heterogeneity has largely prevented meta-analyses. Many trials have used poorly defined, non-reproducible outcome measures, and only trials in high-income settings have included patient-centred outcome measures.

To address this priority, a globally diverse multidisciplinary stakeholder group adopted a structured evidence-based method to reach consensus on a global set of core outcome measurements for snakebite clinical trials.

### Bush animal attacks: management of complex injuries in a resource-limited setting [^112nD2vz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

With trauma triage of animal attacks; vaccination against viruses and antibiotic prophylaxis against common animal-borne organisms in the initial period after attack; and, appropriate surgical management, wild animal injuries can be managed effectively in a resource-limited setting. Given the increasing human-wild animal encounters in changing ecosystems and increasing population in East Africa, rural and tertiary care providers should be familiar with the triage and treatment of varying animal attacks, and when these require referral or can be managed remotely. Further, as attacks potentially increase in the future due to human population burden, community awareness initiatives directed toward both prevention and appropriate treatment of these attacks may be warranted.

Consent

Written informed consent was obtained from the parent of the 6 year old and other patients.

### Laboratory animal bite anaphylaxis: a national survey: part 2: treatment protocols [^112RLcd6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study documents current treatment protocols for laboratory animal bite anaphylaxis in the United States.

Methods

An online survey was e-mailed to designated institutional officials at laboratory animal facilities identified by the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.

Results

One hundred eighty-nine organizations responded to the question of whether they had a treatment protocol with 32% indicating that they had a protocol. Having a case of anaphylaxis increased the likelihood of having a protocol (61%). Of those with a protocol, 58% included treatment with injectable epinephrine, if clinically indicated. Among all respondents, only 14% reported keeping injectable epinephrine at the location where animal work is performed.

Conclusions

A minority of responding organizations had protocols in place to address laboratory animal bite anaphylaxis. Organizations with workers at risk should consider implementing a protocol for assessment and treatment.

Dogs are the animal most frequently implicated in causing bite injuries to the human face. Dog bite injuries are most prevalent in younger patients. Pasteurella species are commensals of the oral microbiome of dogs and cats and are frequently implicated in infections resulting from dog and cat bite injuries. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C need to be considered in bites inflicted by humans. All animal bite wounds should be washed out. Most animal bite injuries can be managed in an outpatient setting. Given the cosmetically sensitive nature of the face, bite wounds generally merit suturing, even in delayed presentations.

### Zoonotic exposures: bites, scratches, and other hazards… [^117U71xP]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal bites and scratches are common sources of serious infections. Any animal can bite or scratch if it feels threatened, is protecting its young or territory, or is injured or ill. Travelers should be aware that attacks by domestic animals are far more common than attacks by wildlife. Infections caused by bite or scratch wounds can result in serious illness or death in humans. Table 3.
7. 1 highlights groups of animals and arthropod vectors that are common reservoirs and routes of transmission of zoonotic diseases. When navigating cities, travelers should move wide around corners or blind spots and check under restaurant tables, food stalls, and parked vehicles because cats, dogs, and monkeys tend to rest in these places. Startling these animals might result in a bite or scratch.

Advise parents traveling with young children to watch them carefully around unfamiliar animals because children are more likely to be bitten or scratched and to sustain more severe injuries. It is also important to advise travelers to wash hands or use hand sanitizer after being in areas around animals, even if they did not touch the animals, to prevent indirect transmission of zoonotic diseases. Rabies A healthcare professional should evaluate travelers bitten or scratched by any animal to assess the need for rabies PEP. If a suspected rabies exposure has occurred, travelers should stop their journey and seek care at a reliable place where they can obtain appropriate PEP; this could require traveling to another country. During the pre-travel consultation, suggest countries where PEP is available and most accessible.

Wound care If a traveler receives a bite or scratch wound, they should clean the wound as soon as possible by washing with soap and running water for ≥ 20 minutes to reduce the risk of infections like B virus or rabies. Where possible, healthcare professionals should promptly clean and debride wounds contaminated with necrotic tissue, dirt, or other foreign materials. Often, a course of antibiotics is appropriate after animal bites or scratches because such wounds can lead to local or systemic infections. Some bite or scratch wounds might need to be left open to heal by secondary intention. Upon leaving the area, travelers should safely and appropriately remove dirty equipment and clothing and wash or bathe as soon as possible. Travelers should also avoid bringing food and drink into areas with dense populations of animals or areas that may be contaminated by body fluids of animals.

### Clinical guidance for wound… [^113BmGCo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- Tetanus vaccination and TIG prophylaxis may be indicated depending on the wound type and patient's vaccination history.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Recommendations Healthcare providers should take the following steps to prevent tetanus:

- Assess the wound and provide appropriate wound care.
- Assess the need for tetanus vaccination and provide if indicated.
- Assess the need for prophylactic tetanus immune globulin and provide if indicated. Wound assessment and care Appropriate wound care consists of
- Assessing the type of wound
- Observing for signs of infection
- Properly treating infected wounds. Assessment Wounds can be categorized based on their tetanus exposure risk.

Clean and minor wounds don't pose a major risk. Dirty or major wounds pose an increased risk. For example, wounds containing devitalized tissue can allow Clostridium tetani to proliferate. The following are examples of dirty or major wounds:

- Penetrating or puncture wounds
- Wounds containing dirt, soil, feces, or saliva
- Wounds containing devitalized tissue:

- Burns
- Compound fractures
- Crush injuries
- Frostbite
- Necrotic or gangrenous wounds Care Healthcare providers should:

- Clean all wounds
- Remove dirt or foreign material
- Remove or debride necrotic material. Tetanus vaccination status evaluation Vaccination not recommended Regardless of wound type, no tetanus vaccination is needed if the patient meets both criteria below:

- Received last tetanus vaccination less than 5 years ago
- Completed the primary vaccine series.

Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccination history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation (prehospital EMS) notes and quality measures state that vinegar has potential to increase pain associated with jellyfish sting as it can increase nematocyst discharge in certain species, and that clinicians must be familiar with endemic species and how to best address exposure. Pertinent assessment findings include assessing for signs and symptoms of local and systematic impact of the suspected toxin and recognizing that a patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocysts, or barb which may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) include 9914079 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Land and 9914081 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Marine. Key documentation elements include accurately describing the suspect bite or sting source without risking patient or emergency medical services (EMS) clinician, only transporting the source animal or insect if it can be done safely in a hard-sided container, repeating evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions may deteriorate rapidly, recording time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments, and documenting therapy and response to therapy. Performance measures include that the offending organism was managed appropriately without secondary exposure, appropriate and timely definitive treatment was provided, and appropriate pain management was achieved.

### Rabies postexposure prophylaxis: what the U.S. emergency medicine provider needs to know [^112t3coq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 55,000 patients per year in the United States are exposed to potentially rabid animals and receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and these patients commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for wound care and PEP. Despite the number of rabies exposures seen in EDs each year, there appears to be a knowledge gap among health care providers with regard to prescribing and administering rabies PEP. The following review aims to bridge that knowledge gap by discussing the importance of obtaining a comprehensive exposure history to determine the category of the encounter, the type of animal, and the location of the bite and of consulting outside expert resources to determine whether the rabies PEP series is indicated. In addition, this article will discuss dosing, administration, and schedule of the rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin to ensure patients are fully protected from developing rabies. Lastly, this article discusses the potential cost associated with rabies PEP and provides information on managing this barrier.

### Managing snakebite [^11785DX9]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What to cover on initial assessment?

Rural and remote primary care centres are often the first point of medical aid for people with a snakebite. Laboratory and intensive care services at such facilities are often limited. A competent clinical assessment is vital to guide management and referral decisions.

Snakebite envenoming can quickly worsen into a life-threatening emergency. Assess vital parameters to identify if the patient is critical or at risk for shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Published severity scores for snakebite are unreliable. The Glasgow coma scale score and pupillary reactions can be misleading in patients with advanced paralysis who are unable to open their eyes or respond to painful stimuli and should be avoided in these circumstances.

History

Reassure clinically stable patients. Ask about their symptoms to determine the presence, nature, and extent of envenoming. Details about the site, circumstances, and timing of the bite can reflect distinctive features of epidemiology, habitats, and periods of activity of medically important snakes locally and help infer likely biting-species.

Inquire about medications, substance use, and comorbidities as these can influence diagnosis and outcomes. Recent ethanol or recreational drug use may modify presenting symptoms. Antiplatelets or anticoagulants may worsen bleeding and interfere with key blood tests. Shock in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease can precipitate a myocardial infarction.

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^112Jn3Ec]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

SHEA expert guidance — animal-assisted activity visit management and incident response directs to Restrict visiting sessions to a maximum of 1 hour and states that handlers must observe the animal for signs of fatigue, stress, thirst, overheating, or urges to urinate or defecate, with the session terminated for that day if a short break does not ease discomfort. In the case of an animal's urinary or fecal accident, immediately terminate the visit; if submissive urination was involved, suspend visiting privileges pending correction and reevaluation, and if repeated incidents of this nature occur, permanently withdraw the animal's visiting privileges. For vomiting or diarrhea, terminate the visit immediately and withdraw the animal from visitation for a minimum of 1 week. The guidance requires reporting any scratches, bites, or other inappropriate animal behavior to healthcare staff immediately and to the animal-assisted activities liaison and public health or animal control authorities as required; the visit should be immediately terminated after any bite or scratch, bites or intentional scratches or other serious inappropriate behavior warrant permanently withdrawing visiting privileges, accidental scratches require preventive measures with withdrawal if frequency cannot be reduced, handler-caused incidents lead to termination of handler visitation privileges until addressed, and inappropriate patient behavior should be reported to the animal visit liaison.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^1169mWXG]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

Objective

Soft-tissue injuries from animal bites and insect stings are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Although many cases follow a short and benign clinical course, life-threatening complications can occur. Imaging can play an important role in guiding clinical care by revealing the scope of the injury and associated complications. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology of animal-related injuries, with a focus on imaging manifestations of soft-tissue injury using multiple techniques in a pictorial review format.

Conclusion

This article reviews the imaging manifestations of soft-tissue injuries caused by animal bites and insect stings. After completing this article, the reader should have an improved ability to recognize complications of soft-tissue injuries and the role of advanced imaging in select cases.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^115WKXCK]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Shortlisting core outcome domains

Through our systematic review, 153 unique outcome measures were extracted verbatim, and 60 outcome domains were identified. A shortlisting questionnaire (appendix p 5) was circulated to the stakeholder and expert groups. Domains were scored and categorised as: 7–9 (essential); 6–4 (desirable); or 3–1 (inappropriate). At least two domains were shortlisted for each clinical syndrome of envenoming, based on score rankings. Respondents could recommend additional domains not identified through the systematic review, and these were automatically shortlisted (appendix p 13).

Four universal and seven syndrome-specific categories were agreed by the stakeholder and expert groups: Universal (all snake species) categories include: (1) mortality, (2) disability, (3) acute allergic reaction, and (4) serum sickness; and syndrome-specific (snake species-specific) categories include: (1) neurotoxicity, (2) haemotoxicity, (3) coagulopathy, (4) local tissue damage, (5) renal injury, (6) systemic myotoxicity, and (7) hypotension.

Reaching consensus on core outcome measures

A primary literature review was prepared by one investigator (MA), circulated to the stakeholder and expert groups for wider input, and maintained as a live document (appendix p 14). This literature review included relevant information on outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments. A series of four stakeholder group consensus meetings were held, with a total duration of 10 h. One investigator (MA) presented a summary of the questionnaire results and literature for each shortlisted outcome domain. Meetings were chaired by a senior investigator (DGL). A semistructured discussion on outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments took place, and all stakeholder group members had the opportunity to share their views. Once all views had been shared, anonymous voting took place with at least 70% agreement needed to confirm a core outcome measure.

### Managing snakebite [^1151nyLU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long term disability, and death
Immobilise the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilisation is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended
The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings
Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress
Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80 000 and 138 000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event. Symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis and disability, and psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420 000) and Latin America (150 000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100 000, 32 000, and 5000 deaths respectively) possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis. The World Health Organization recognised snakebite as a neglected tropical disease in 2017 and called for concerted global action to reduce deaths and disability.

In this clinical update, we present an approach to evaluation and management of snakebites for primary care providers in resource-limited settings in endemic regions. The principles of management are broadly similar, but it is beyond the scope of this article to cover clinical syndromes and management for the varied snake species globally.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of integrated bite case management and sustained dog vaccination for rabies control [^112HfJtp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2013, the CDC collaborated with the Haitian government to initiate the Haiti Animal Rabies Surveillance Program (HARSP), an integrated bite case management (IBCM) system that combines active community-based dog bite investigations with passive animal rabies investigations. The active component of the community bite investigation is conducted via active surveillance and sampling of found dead dogs, coupled with counseling of bite victims. The passive component of the investigation is dependent on reports generated from medical centers and community members. However, the program requires extensive support, with a large team trained in rabies surveillance needed for fieldwork. These control officers are responsible for locating suspected rabid animals involved in bite events and completing a rabies assessment. During assessment of the biting dog, all clinical signs, vaccination status, sex, and estimated age are recorded. If successful capture of the dog occurs, it is either euthanized immediately and tests submitted for diagnosis, or the animal is placed in quarantine in the owner's home and observed for 14 days. The CDC recognizes six components of HARSP: surveillance, laboratory capacity, public education, responsible dog ownership, mass dog vaccination campaigns, and government engagement. When combined, these components increase dog rabies case detection and can prevent transmission to humans. Dog bite investigations allow for the removal of rabid dogs from the community, reducing the risk of potential exposures and encouraging bite victims to seek appropriate medical care. Estimates suggest that the risk of being bitten by a rabid dog is relatively low in Haiti (∼0.3%), based on the relatively small proportion of dogs that test positive. Hampson et al.produced regional model estimates of biting incidence per 100,000 and reported 238.6 for Haiti. Schildecker et al.received over 2,000 survey responses to assess dog ecology and barriers to rabies control in dog populations in Haiti. The study estimated a bite incidence of 0.32 per 100,000 population across 14 communes in four departments. This suggests that there are large differences between field-derived and modeled estimates of bite rates.

### Bites (mammalian) [^1112RfdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mammalian bites are usually caused by dogs, cats, or humans, and are more prevalent in children (especially boys) than in adults. Animal bites are usually caused by the person's pet and, in children, frequently involve the face. Human bites tend to occur in children as a result of playing or fighting, while in adults they are usually the result of physical or sexual abuse. Mixed aerobe and anaerobe infection is the most common type of infection, and can occur in up to half of human bites.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent complications of mammalian bites? What are the effects of treatments for infected mammalian bites? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic prophylaxis (human bites, non-human bites), antibiotics, debridement, decontamination, irrigation, primary wound closure, and tetanus vaccination (after mammalian bites).

### Managing snakebite [^111vseKs]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Antivenom

Guidelines from the WHO recommend antivenom treatment for patients with shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, neurotoxicity, black urine, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites by species known to cause local necrosis and digital bites.

Antivenoms are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins fractionated from the plasma of domesticated animals hyper-immunised with venom from one or more snake species over variable periods. They are highly specific and will neutralise only the venoms used in their production and those of a few closely related species. Polyspecific antivenoms are raised against a mixture of venoms from more than one species. Antivenoms raised against venom from a single species are monospecific.

Early administration of antivenom prevents or limits haemodynamic alterations, progression of coagulopathy to clinically overt bleeding, postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, acute kidney injury, and local tissue damage. Physiological levels of clotting factors are at least partially restored within a median of six hours with sufficient doses of specific antivenoms.

Robust clinical data on the safe and effective initial dose of antivenom are lacking for most products. Clinicians often rely on manufacturers' recommendations provided as package inserts or labels, but these can be unreliable. We suggest following national protocols or standard regional guidelines for dose. Administration is always intravenous, as bolus or diluted in saline solution over 10–60 minutes, at the same dose for adults and children. Repeat administration of antivenom if bleeding persists, if weakness or cardiovascular signs worsen within two hours, or if a 20WBCT is positive at six hours after antivenom administration.

The effectiveness of antivenoms in treating established neurotoxicity, soft tissue damage, and acute kidney injury is not established. Additional treatments are indicated for these.

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^11455JnX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Research animals — policy provisions for minimizing risks: Only one-third of the policies discussed research animals. Those noted that although it is sometimes necessary for research animals to be present in patient care areas, every effort must be made to minimize interactions between the animals, HCP (healthcare personnel), and patients. These policies stated that all animal research must be approved by the institution's IACUC and, when research animals must be present in patient care areas, animal visits must be scheduled to minimize overlap with patient care activities. For example, small animals should be caged and covered with drapes or opaque material, and other recommendations said that animals should only be transported in service elevators not utilized by patients. In cases where macaque nonhuman primates are research animals, one policy recommended that a bite and scratch kit and a copy of the CDC guideline on treatment of herpes B virus accompany the animals. Policies reinforced the importance of comprehensive record keeping and appropriate waste disposal, noting that the principal investigator is ultimately responsible for these tasks, and policies varied on internal notification (eg, Infection Prevention and Control, Safety Compliance office).

### Quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite: the neglect continues [^113NetKF]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary box

Snakebite is a major public health problem in many parts of the world.
WHO has readded snakebite to the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017.
The two WHO guidelines on management of snakebite were appraised and found to have poor quality.
The guidelines had inadequate stakeholder involvement, poor methodological rigour, and competing interests were inadequately managed.
WHO should ensure development of high-quality guidelines on snakebite management in accordance with the WHO's Guideline Review Committee process.

Snakebite remains a major public health challenge in many parts of rural Africa, Asia and South America. Available estimates suggest that there are about 94 000 deaths across the world annually due to snakebites; a conservative estimate as many deaths in low and middle-income countries are not reported. The burden on health systems due to snakebite is much higher than what is indicated by the mortality, because even non-venomous snakebite victims visit healthcare facilities for assessment and the morbidity due to snakebite has been scarcely documented. The social and economic consequences of snakebite are known to be high in communities with high prevalence.

Despite its consequences, snakebite has largely been neglected in global health. The WHO readded snakebite to the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017 — potentially implying more attention and funding for disease control programmes and treatment access initiatives. Such initiatives and programme planning are informed by recommendations in practice guidelines. WHO guidelines are highly influential in South Asia, South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (countries with high burden of snakebite) where the lack of in-country capacity for guideline development means WHO guidelines are used as it is or are being adapted.

It is, therefore, essential to evaluate the quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite. We identified the latest version of the WHO South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) guideline (2016)and the WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) guideline (2010) by searching the WHO website. Three authors independently appraised the quality of these guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II, a validated tool for assessing quality of guidelinesvia the online data management system available in the AGREE TRUST website which blinds the appraisers from each other. The AGREE II has 23 items categorised into six domains and two overall assessment items and is widely used for assessing the quality of guidelines including by the WHO.

### Animal bites and stings with anaphylactic potential [^112b9DtF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis to animal bites and stings poses a significant medical risk of vascular or respiratory reactions that vary according to the patient's response and nature of the insult. Emergency Physicians frequently see patients who complain of an allergic reaction to an animal bite or sting. Although Hymenoptera stings, specifically those of wasps, bees, and hornets, account for the majority of these cases, other invertebrates and vertebrates are capable of causing allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Many of the causative animals are quite unusual, and their bites and stings are not commonly appreciated as potential causes of anaphylaxis. We conducted a literature review to identify documented reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions to animal bites and stings. This summary is meant to heighten awareness of the diversity of animals that may cause anaphylaxis, hopefully leading to more rapid diagnosis and treatment of this dangerous condition. A diverse group of animals was found whose bites and stings cause anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions. Some case summaries are presented. A potentially life-saving plan is to direct patients to proper follow-up care to prevent a future life-threatening reaction, including: prescribing epinephrine and antihistamines with proper instructions for their use; referral to an allergist to determine if skin testing, radioallergosorbent test, and immunotherapy are indicated; and reporting the case to state or local Poison Control Centers. In some cases it may be helpful to consult an entomologist or a pest control service for help in identification and elimination of certain offenders.

Lyme disease — prophylaxis eligibility following a tick bite is confined to clearly high-risk exposures: "We recommend that prophylactic antibiotic therapy be given only to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of an identified high-risk tick bite but not for bites that are equivocal risk or low risk (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)". If a bite cannot be confidently classified as high risk, "a wait-and-watch approach is recommended". A bite is "high-risk only if it meets the following 3 criteria": an identified Ixodes spp. vector species, occurrence in a highly endemic area, and attachment for ≥ 36 hours.

Wound evaluation in austere settings — A thorough history should be obtained, including an accurate history of the injury and the environment in which it occurred, and immunization status (especially tetanus and rabies) is important to obtain; status may be an important determinant of whether or not evacuation is necessary. Knowledge of the mechanism of injury and the environment plays an important role, as animal and human bites may introduce complex bacteria, and patients with burns may have significant associated inhalation injury. Important anatomic considerations include significant cosmetic area (especially the face), communication with a joint, association with neurovascular or tendon injury, locations that may be associated with significant acute disability impacting mobilization, and relationship to an associated foreign body. Evaluation requires a bloodless field and proper lighting and may require anesthesia, and evaluation should include an assessment of neurovascular status and tendon function.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^111TrTeG]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Snakebite clinical trials have often used heterogeneous outcome measures and there is an urgent need for standardisation. A globally representative group of key stakeholders came together to reach consensus on a globally relevant set of core outcome measurements. Outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments were identified through searching the literature and a systematic review of snakebite clinical trials. Outcome domains were shortlisted by use of a questionnaire and consensus was reached among stakeholders and the patient group through facilitated discussions and voting. Five universal core outcome measures should be included in all future snakebite clinical trials — mortality, WHO disability assessment scale, patient-specific functional scale, acute allergic reaction by Brown criteria, and serum sickness by formal criteria. Additional syndrome-specific core outcome measures should be used depending on the biting species. This core outcome measurement set provides global standardisation, supports the priorities of patients and clinicians, enables meta-analysis, and is appropriate for use in low-income and middle-income settings.

### Laboratory animal allergy [^115tNgPW]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) — worker management and immunotherapy — In workers with asthma associated with animal allergens who wish to continue to work with animals, work should be limited to only essential tasks, and strenuous work modifications may be required (e.g., work only within engineering devices that provide directional airflow and filtration, wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protective equipment (RPE), having a rescue inhaler immediately available at all times, and adding focused asthma exams), and continuing work under these circumstances requires that the worker becomes and remains free of any LAA symptoms. For anaphylaxis from animal exposure, workers should be assigned to jobs that do not involve a risk of bites, workers who return to work with animals implicated in causing anaphylaxis should be required to keep injectable or epinephrine with them and a recently approved epinephrine nasal spray may be an alternative option, at-risk workers should not work alone in settings where bites or sharps exposures may occur, puncture-resistant gloves may be helpful if they do not excessively limit dexterity, and co-workers and first responders should be trained in how to recognize and address possible cases of anaphylaxis, including the administration of injectable or nasal epinephrine. Regarding immunotherapy, in general, for many patients, immunotherapy is effective in reducing asthma and rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis outcomes, there is limited published data on immunotherapy for rodent allergy and for those who have improvement in symptoms with immunotherapy, benefits may wane over time, and immunotherapy should be continued for at least 3 years.

What first aid can be provided?

Reassure the person about prompt first aid and medical assistance to allay fears. Arrange for rapid transport to the nearest medical facility, preferably with access to antivenom and critical care support.

Immobilise the person, and especially the bitten limb to slow venom spread. Remove rings and other tight objects around the limb. A systematic review identified pressure immobilisation with an elastic bandage or pad (at a comfortable pressure) at the bite site as an effective first aid measure to slow venom spread, but the quality of evidence was very low. Its use is variable, and it is discouraged in most practice and guidelines because of the uncertainty of benefit and possibility of worsening local tissue damage. However, pressure immobilisation is generally recommended for neurotoxic elapid bites in some regions. Its clinical efficacy and risk of worsening soft tissue injury in local envenoming have not been adequately assessed. A small study (15 patients) in Myanmar found that pressure pads were effective in reducing venom spread in Russell's viper bite, and local effects after pad application were no more severe than those before treatment.

Tourniquets can cause severe local damage and gangrene and must not be used. It is common for communities to resort to traditional therapies such as wound incisions, cauterisation, and application of herbs, minerals, or animal excrement. These can delay access to effective treatment and may cause more harm. Irrigate eyes with copious amounts of water if there is exposure to venom.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Summary

Bite injuries are a prevalent form of injury globally, with the potential to result in a range of complications at the site of the wound. It is therefore essential that they receive time-critical and individualized care. Children are a high-risk demographic, with the head and neck region being particularly susceptible to injury. In addition to the common dog, cat, and human bites, there are regional differences in the species of domestic and wild animals that may inflict bites. Infection rates also exhibit regional variation, which is likely attributable to differences in the rates of presentation or injury severity.

Guidance — exclusion criteria and accommodations for service animals list situations in which a service animal may be excluded from the healthcare facility, including when the animal exhibits aggressive behavior such as snarling, biting, scratching, or teeth baring, is excessively noisy, or is unable to properly contain bodily excretions such as not being housebroken or having vomiting or diarrhea. If facility personnel reasonably believe a service animal is infectious or ill, the animal should not be allowed to remain with the person with a disability until evaluated by a veterinarian with written certification acceptable to the facility that it does not pose an increased risk to patients or staff, and the policy should include locations from which service animals are prohibited and reasons for exclusion. Where exclusion is based solely on risk to the service animal, the patient should be consulted, and when the service animal is restricted from accompanying the patient, reasonable accommodation should be made for the person with disability to function without the service animal.

### Surgical management of pediatric dog bites: a systematic review and treatment guideline [^115sd8Wd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dog bites are a unique and unusual injury in children, associated with atypical bacterial species, high infection rates, and controversial surgical treatment. Expert recommendations currently guide management and no surgical evidence-based guidelines exist. We conducted a systematic review to answer three management questions: (1) What are the best practices for wound management? (2) In what circumstances should prophylactic antibiotics be administered? (3) In what circumstances should rabies prophylaxis be given?

Methods

A structured review was performed using a keyword search querying "pediatric" "dog bite" "management". Results were reported according to the PRISMA methodology. The quality of nonrandomized studies was evaluated according to Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS). Qualitative analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 803 studies were identified and 53 studies were included in the final analysis. Current literature suggests that primary closure of bites which are well irrigated and sharply debrided within 8 h of injury, is not associated with increased infection. While dog bites are associated with an overall high rate of infection (6–25%), routine antibiotic prophylaxis in low-risk wounds does not lower that risk. Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies is indicated for all dog bites where the rabies status of the dog cannot be determined, or the animal cannot be quarantined for 10 days.

Conclusion

High-quality evidence regarding the surgical management of pediatric dog bites is limited. Trial data have demonstrated improved outcomes in wound healing and infection rates with a focus on copious irrigation and diligent wound debridement, although independent validation is needed.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1113EffU]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Occupational health — pathogen-specific management in laboratory and animal settings includes maintaining a registry of pathogens in use and awareness that laboratory exposures may entail greater inoculum and different clinical presentations than naturally acquired infections. Select agents are defined as biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health, and possession and handling of these pathogens are strictly regulated by federal law (Bioterrorism Preparedness Act). Nonhuman primates, particularly macaque species, can be asymptomatic carriers of B virus, a herpesvirus with > 70% mortality in untreated humans, and all macaque exposure incidents should have targeted training, decontamination, and treatment protocols meeting national guidelines. Rabies researchers/staff dealing with wild or feral animals should have pre-exposure immunization and sero-monitoring, poxvirus researchers should be offered Vaccinia vaccination as well as counseling specific to poxvirus risk factors such as atopic dermatitis, and bite injuries from cats, dogs, primates, and large mammals should receive prophylactic antibiotics in many cases. Q fever, carried by cattle, sheep, and goats, is notable for infection after very small inoculums; exposed staff should be closely monitored for early treatment to prevent endocarditis and other sequelae. Toxoplasmosis is extremely dangerous to pregnant and immune-compromised patients; post-exposure prophylaxis regimens are available but toxic, and serial serologic monitoring may be useful for management decisions.

### Bite injuries in a connected world: a call for global consensus on clinical and public health action [^112Cb45S]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

This edition of the Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open journal explores a problem as ancient as human history itself: the consequences of human–human and human–animal interactions. It describes the pattern and outcomes of bite injuries in a major German city which reflect patterns in most urban settings. Although common, animal bites rarely attract attention unless they are sensational enough to make the news, such as rare shark or crocodile attacks.

Although more commonly associated with domesticated animals, bite injury sources vary between geographical locations and range from arthropods, rodents, reptiles to exotic animals. The incidence ranges from 50 to 200 per 100,000 population per year and is associated with a significant social, economic, and psychological burden.

In the US alone, animal bites have been estimated to cost US$13 billion annually. Apart from the financial burden, evidence shows that animal bites can leave long-lasting psychological effects. Although not clearly explored in adults, children have notably been found to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, which may eventually reflect onto their caregivers. This is another potential area of research that may delve into the broader range of effects that bite injuries portend.

Being among the most common causes for bite-related injuries and the dramatic impact of rabies and envenomation, dog and snake bites have garnered significant attention and research with well-established protocols in management.

Each region of the world has its own unique challenges owing to the variety of predominant fauna, such as shark and spider bites in Australia, camel, falcon, and exotic animal bites in the Middle East, and monkey bites in Southeast Asia. These unique patterns of bites bring with them their own challenges requiring dedicated research into the causes, prevention, and treatment. As population movements increase globally, these local problems will have wider-reaching consequences. As such, the exchange of knowledge across regions would help in improving awareness and even mitigation. Furthermore, the development, use, and distribution of novel technologies in the prevention of animal attacks can impact the epidemiology of these injuries. For example, the use of shark listening stations, drones, and SMART drumlines in Australia has reduced human-shark interactions.

What would be beneficial would be the creation of a global registry of bite-related injuries with global standards for reporting akin to the WHO rabies registry. This may help with the exchange of knowledge across regions and the formulation of standardized prevention and treatment protocols.

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: evaluation and management [^111qxQys]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Because of specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity. Human and animal bites most commonly lead to polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, and Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals. Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound. Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require débridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^113KHevu]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society basic wound management — empiric antibiotic choices states that because culture information will not be available and many infections are likely to be polymicrobial in nature, empiric therapy is indicated with consideration of any unique environmental issues associated with the inoculum and which items are available; amoxicillin/clavulanate is often a first choice for infected animal bites and other skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), moxifloxacin is suitable for SSTI including animal bites in the penicillin-allergic patient and is a good first-choice agent for infections caused by aquatic exposures, and other suitable antibiotics may include oral second- or third-generation cephalosporins, with no single particular agent reliably effective in all scenarios.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116qPyXd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation patient safety — Do not apply tourniquets, tight Ace/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below the site; do not incise and/or suction the wound to remove toxin; and do not apply cold packs or immerse the extremity in ice water. EMS clinicians should not try to capture the marine or terrestrial animal or insect. If the organism has been killed, many dead insect, marine, or fanged animals can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and closed container for future identification. A patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocyst, or barb that may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded; consider safe removal without squeezing the toxin delivery apparatus.

### Managing parrot bite injuries to the hand: not just another animal bite [^115hFpWJ]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bites and scratches are common injuries, frequently sustained from humans, dogs and cats. Exotic pet-related harm however is an important and increasingly emerging class of injury. Whilst the principles of prompt and thorough medical assessment, antibiotics and potential surgical washout and debridement apply, exotic pet wounds require further consideration. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (also known as co-amoxiclav) is not sufficient for the pathogens transmitted by parrot bites. We illustrate the importance of adequate consideration of microbiological pathogens with a case report of an open finger fracture resulting from a parrot bite. We intend this to be a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in their effective management of such injuries.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: management of mammalian bites in children-from local wound care to prophylactic antibiotics [^115xyGQz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bites are a common reason for emergency consultation, especially in children. The most common complication of bite wounds is local infection. Systemic infections are much rarer. The key in reducing the risk of infection after a mammalian bite is local wound management with either primary or delayed closure. The benefit of administering prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence for the management of mammalian bites in children, including recommendations for appropriate investigations, wound management, administration of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics and the prevention of systemic infections.
