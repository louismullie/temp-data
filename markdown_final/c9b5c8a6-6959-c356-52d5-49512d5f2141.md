## Question

coagulation therapy for a patient with ovarian cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about coagulation therapy for a patient with ovarian cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology so we don't conflate prophylaxis, treatment of established VTE, and perioperative bleeding control. Then, I should verify the baseline VTE risk in ovarian cancer and how it varies by stage, histology, and treatment phase. Next, I will review guideline-backed prophylaxis strategies, including inpatient, surgical, and outpatient settings. After that, I need to examine treatment options for established VTE, including LMWH versus DOACs and duration. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like thrombocytopenia, HIT, and drug interactions, and close with practical, risk-stratified recommendations and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misapply guidance. "Coagulation therapy" in ovarian cancer generally refers to three distinct clinical questions: primary thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE, treatment of established VTE, and perioperative hemostatic strategies to reduce bleeding. I need to keep these separate because the evidence base and recommendations differ substantially across these domains [^bc558532] [^fc8e2643].

> I will now examine baseline VTE risk in ovarian cancer to anchor decisions. Ovarian cancer carries one of the highest VTE risks among solid tumors, with incidence estimates around 4–7% in some series and higher in advanced disease and during chemotherapy. Clear cell histology appears particularly thrombogenic, and the risk is front-loaded around diagnosis and surgery, with another spike at relapse or re-initiation of therapy [^dc6a4e45] [^17f06c32]. Wait, let me verify the timing: yes, the highest risk is in the first 0–4 months after diagnosis, which aligns with practice patterns for extended prophylaxis and early initiation of anticoagulation when VTE is diagnosed [^17f06c32].

> Next, I should review inpatient and perioperative prophylaxis. For hospitalized patients with active malignancy, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended in the absence of bleeding or contraindications, typically with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux, and mechanical prophylaxis should be added when pharmacologic therapy is contraindicated or as adjuncts in very high-risk patients [^7e3a4714] [^b5231643]. Hold on, I should verify surgical specifics: after major abdominopelvic cancer surgery, extended-duration LMWH for about 4 weeks reduces VTE without excess bleeding, and this is standard in gynecologic oncology; combining mechanical and pharmacologic methods improves efficacy in the highest-risk patients [^e4be13d4] [^fc8e2643] [^b5231643].

> Now, outpatient primary prophylaxis is trickier, so I need to check the risk stratification. Routine pharmacologic prophylaxis is not recommended for all ambulatory patients with cancer; it should be considered for high-risk patients starting systemic therapy, often defined by a Khorana score ≥ 2, after discussing bleeding risk, drug interactions, and cost [^bf53dbd0] [^7852fca4]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: recent RCTs and meta-analyses show that low-dose DOACs or LMWH can reduce VTE in high-risk ambulatory patients, but bleeding risk is higher with DOACs in some cancers, so agent selection must be individualized [^bc558532] [^7852fca4].

> For established VTE, I should confirm first-line therapy. Historically, LMWH monotherapy for at least 6 months has been standard in cancer-associated thrombosis, and this remains acceptable, particularly when renal function is limited or bleeding risk is high [^e5282275] [^fdcab4c4]. But wait, let me verify the evolving role of DOACs: multiple contemporary guidelines now suggest DOACs as reasonable alternatives for short-term treatment of CAT, with the caveat of increased major bleeding in gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers; in ovarian cancer specifically, comparative data suggest similar or lower recurrence with rivaroxaban versus LMWH, though careful patient selection is essential [^d4c17263] [^96d287f6] [^b5957ea7]. I should double-check duration: minimum 6 months is advised, with extension for active cancer or ongoing therapy, reassessed periodically for net clinical benefit [^e5282275] [^de4b54fa].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios that change management. In severe thrombocytopenia, particularly platelets < 20,000/µL, anticoagulation should generally be held; in intermediate ranges, dose-adjusted or interrupted regimens may be used with hematology input, balancing thrombosis and bleeding risks [^9646f65d]. For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, non-heparin agents such as fondaparinux or direct thrombin inhibitors are indicated; warfarin should be avoided until platelets recover to avoid limb-threatening thrombosis [^ff296760] [^2ac62ee1]. But wait, what if there is significant renal dysfunction? DOACs should be avoided when creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min, pushing LMWH or VKA as alternatives depending on kidney function and access [^cebe36a7].

> Let me consider perioperative bleeding mitigation, since that is often conflated with "coagulation therapy". Tranexamic acid can reduce blood loss in major surgery, but evidence in advanced ovarian cancer cytoreduction is limited to a single RCT showing a modest reduction in estimated blood loss without clear transfusion benefit; thus, routine use is not firmly established and should be individualized to high-risk bleeding scenarios [^1ee52ed9]. I should confirm that this remains adjunctive to meticulous surgical technique and ERAS pathways rather than a substitute for them [^f46c0a2f].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and practical prescribing. DOACs have fewer interactions than warfarin but still require screening for CYP3A4 and P-gp modulators, and agents like apixaban may be preferred when interaction risk is a concern; LMWH avoids most interaction issues but requires injections and monitoring in renal impairment, which can affect adherence and feasibility in some settings [^cebe36a7]. Hold on, I should verify real-world prescribing patterns: in ovarian cancer, rivaroxaban use is more common in patients with CKD or rural access issues, reflecting convenience and infrastructure constraints, which reinforces the need to align choice with patient context [^533f6a1b].

> I will now synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For all patients with ovarian cancer, I should screen for VTE symptoms at every visit and educate on signs of DVT/PE. For low-risk outpatients not starting chemotherapy, no routine pharmacologic prophylaxis is needed. For high-risk ambulatory patients starting systemic therapy, consider apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH after discussing bleeding, interactions, and duration, with a preference for LMWH if GI/GU bleeding risk is high or renal function is poor. For surgery, use combined mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis in hospital and extend LMWH to 28 days postoperatively in high-risk features. For established VTE, treat for at least 6 months with LMWH or a DOAC, extending therapy if cancer is active, and reassess periodically for ongoing benefit [^bf53dbd0] [^7852fca4] [^e4be13d4] [^e5282275] [^de4b54fa].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and follow-up elements. Baseline labs should include CBC, renal and hepatic function, and a careful bleeding history; during anticoagulation, monitor for bleeding, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and adjust for renal function and drug interactions; in patients on PARP inhibitors, anticipate and manage thrombocytopenia proactively to avoid compounding bleeding risk [^5549113a]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not overpromising survival benefits: anticoagulation is not indicated to improve survival in the absence of VTE, so goals should be explicit and centered on thrombosis prevention or treatment rather than oncologic outcome modification [^6b372cad] [^8ed07e0b].

---

For patients with ovarian cancer, **LMWH is first-line** for VTE treatment and prophylaxis because of its efficacy and safety in this high-risk population [^fdcab4c4] [^e5282275]. DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are **reasonable alternatives** for treatment when LMWH is unsuitable or declined, with caution for bleeding risk and drug interactions [^d4c17263] [^96d287f6]. Routine anticoagulation to improve survival is **not recommended** in the absence of VTE [^6b372cad] [^8ed07e0b]. For surgical patients, extend LMWH prophylaxis to 28 days postoperatively [^e4be13d4] [^fc8e2643], and consider outpatient prophylaxis in high-risk ambulatory patients starting chemotherapy [^7852fca4] [^bc558532]. Monitor for bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and renal function, and adjust therapy as needed [^cebe36a7].

## Indications for coagulation therapy in ovarian cancer

Coagulation therapy in ovarian cancer is indicated for **VTE treatment and prophylaxis**, given the high risk of thrombosis in this population [^bc558532] [^dc6a4e45]. The main indications include:

- **Treatment of established VTE**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are common in ovarian cancer and require prompt anticoagulation [^bc558532].

- **Primary prophylaxis**: High-risk patients, such as those undergoing major surgery or starting chemotherapy, benefit from thromboprophylaxis [^e4be13d4] [^7852fca4].

- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Patients with a history of VTE require ongoing anticoagulation to prevent recurrence [^e5282275].

---

## Recommended anticoagulant agents

Several **anticoagulant agents** are available for managing VTE in ovarian cancer patients, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Anticoagulant agent** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) | First-line for treatment and prophylaxis of VTE | Strongly recommended [^fdcab4c4] [^e5282275] |
| Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) | Alternative to LMWH for treatment of VTE | Conditionally recommended (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) [^d4c17263] [^96d287f6] |
| Warfarin | Alternative when LMWH or DOACs are contraindicated | Conditionally recommended [^8e7d0eaa] |
| Fondaparinux | Alternative for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) | Conditionally recommended [^8d1601ca] |

---

LMWH remains the **gold standard** due to its proven efficacy and safety in cancer patients, while DOACs are increasingly used as alternatives, particularly when LMWH is contraindicated or not preferred [^fdcab4c4] [^d4c17263].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations for **coagulation therapy** in ovarian cancer patients:

- **Initial treatment**: LMWH is preferred for the initial treatment of VTE in cancer patients, including those with ovarian cancer [^fdcab4c4] [^e5282275].

- **Extended treatment**: Anticoagulation should be continued for at least 6 months, with consideration of indefinite therapy in patients with active cancer [^e5282275] [^de4b54fa].

- **Primary prophylaxis**: Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended for hospitalized patients with active malignancy and for high-risk ambulatory patients starting chemotherapy [^7e3a4714] [^7852fca4].

- **Surgical prophylaxis**: Extended-duration LMWH prophylaxis (up to 4 weeks) is recommended after major abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer [^e4be13d4] [^fc8e2643].

---

## Risks and benefits of coagulation therapy

Coagulation therapy in ovarian cancer patients carries both **benefits and risks**:

Benefits include a **reduced risk of VTE recurrence** and improved quality of life through fewer thrombotic complications [^bc558532] [^e5282275]. Risks include **bleeding complications**, which are more common in cancer patients, and drug interactions, particularly with chemotherapy agents [^cebe36a7] [^610ce018].

---

## Special considerations and precautions

When administering coagulation therapy to ovarian cancer patients, several **special considerations** must be taken into account:

- **Renal impairment**: LMWH requires dose adjustment in renal insufficiency, and DOACs are contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) [^cebe36a7].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Anticoagulation may need to be adjusted or withheld in patients with significant thrombocytopenia [^9646f65d].

- **Drug interactions**: Careful assessment of potential drug interactions is essential, particularly with chemotherapy agents [^610ce018].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is crucial, considering patient values, lifestyle, and preferences [^7852fca4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure the **safe and effective use** of anticoagulation therapy:

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regular assessment of renal function, platelet count, and coagulation parameters is recommended [^notfound].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Patients should be monitored for bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and signs of recurrent VTE [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of bleeding and thrombosis, and when to seek medical attention [^057ee188].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Coagulation therapy is a critical component of care for ovarian cancer patients, given their high risk of VTE. LMWH remains the **first-line therapy** for both treatment and prophylaxis, with DOACs as reasonable alternatives in selected patients. Clinical guidelines emphasize individualized treatment, careful monitoring, and shared decision-making to balance the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy [^fdcab4c4] [^e5282275].

### Reciprocal links between venous thromboembolism, coagulation factors and ovarian cancer progression [^292e0a4d]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, which is due to late presentation. Treating advanced stage ovarian cancer is difficult, and tumor recurrence and chemoresistance frequently occur. In addition, early detection remains a major challenge as there are no early warning signs and no appropriate biomarkers. To reduce mortality rates of ovarian cancer patients, novel drug targets and biomarkers are needed. We postulate that hemostatic keyplayers are of importance when combatting ovarian cancer. The majority of ovarian cancer patients have abnormal hemostatic blood serum marker levels, which indicate an activated coagulation system. This makes patients more prone to experiencing venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the occurrence of VTE in ovarian cancer patients adversely affects survival. Coagulation activation also promotes tumor progression as it influences tumor biology at several stages and the decreased survival rates associated with ovarian cancer-associated thrombosis are more likely due to cancer metastasis rather than to fatal thromboembolic events. In this review, we will discuss; (1) Population studies that address the bidirectional relationship between VTE and ovarian cancer, and the most important risk factors involved; (2) The mechanisms of coagulation factors and platelets that are critically involved in the development of VTE, and the progression of ovarian cancer; (3) Roles and future directions of coagulation factors in ovarian cancer therapy, and in diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer as biomarkers.

### Thrombosis in ovarian cancer: a case control study [^17f06c32]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The highest risk of thrombotic events was in the immediate 0–4 months after diagnosis. Thrombosis pre-dated the diagnosis of cancer in 13% (12 out of 90) of cases. Further smaller spikes in incidence were noted a year later likely related to new disease relapse and re-initiation of chemotherapy. This finding validates the current approach of thromboprophylaxis trials with chemotherapy targeting patients with new cancer diagnoses and also confirms that treatment duration of 6 months is appropriate given that the incidence falls sharply after the first few months. This decrease could be the result of response to treatment and disease remission. Over the next few years the falling incidence reflects a declining patient population as the majority succumb to their disease.

The study findings raise some pertinent questions. Is a thrombotic event an independent predictor of poor outcomes in ovarian cancer and is preventive therapy likely to be beneficial, that is, reduce incidence of thrombosis and improve survival with low risk of bleeding? The current clinical practice guidelines suggest that prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered in selected high-risk outpatients as well as in hospitalised patients with cancer. Studies to date that also included small subsets of ovarian cancer patients have not answered this question satisfactorily as the additional benefit of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with LMWH in these trials was too small to be clinically meaningful. The problem in part may be due to failure to recruit sufficient numbers of patients with poor PS who are the group at highest risk of thrombotic complications.

### Thrombosis in ovarian cancer: a case control study [^ba5c834e]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Although warfarin remains the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy for treatment of thromboembolic disease outside of the setting of cancer, LMWH has been studied extensively and has been adopted as the anticoagulant of choice in the oncology setting. Although the novel oral anticoagulants, direct thrombin inhibitors and factor-Xa inhibitors, are gaining acceptance as alternative oral anticoagulants to warfarin, they have not yet been sufficiently studied to be recommended for the treatment or prophylaxis of thrombosis in patients with cancer. An advantage to their use is that they do not require routine laboratory monitoring and they would be more convenient than LMWH which requires daily subcutaneous administration. However, a noteworthy limitation is the absence of an intervention to reverse their action in the event of significant bleeding. They do however represent an exciting area of future research.

Although the findings of the current study have generated new hypotheses, any conclusions drawn are limited by the exploratory nature of the study, and these hypotheses now warrant further investigation to confirm their possible significance. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests has not been applied in this exploratory analysis. Although all patients in the case and control cohorts received standard multimodality therapy according to local guidance, treated through the same outpatient department, as no clinical data were collected on the control cohort beyond the data on stage and PS, we cannot exclude differences in clinical management which may impact upon risk of thrombosis.

In summary, thrombotic events in ovarian cancer are associated with poor survival; however, the outcomes are no worse than in patients with equivalent stage of disease and matched for PS. Women with advanced disease and poor PS constitute a high-risk sub-population and future trials of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing chemotherapy must focus on this patient group to maximise the potential patient benefit.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in gynecologic oncology: a Society of Gynecologic Oncology clinical practice statement [^3c83c772]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in women with gynecologic malignancies. This practice statement provides clinical data and overall quality of evidence regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in this patient population. Specifically, it reviews patient selection, safety measures, and nuances of perioperative use of these medications. The scope of this document is limited to DOAC use in gynecologic oncology rather than a broad discussion of VTE prophylaxis and management in general. The following recommendations and examination of extant data are based on DOAC trials conducted primarily in mixed populations with different cancer subtypes. Many of these trials include few, or no, women with gynecologic cancer. However, because there is very limited data in gynecologic cancer-specific populations, the results of these studies represent the best available evidence to support treatment recommendations in our patients. The members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee believe that the results of these studies may be extrapolated, with caution, to VTE treatment and prophylaxis for patients with gynecologic cancer.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis [^bc558532]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in patients with cancer and is greatest in those with cancers of the pancreas, stomach, brain, lung and ovary, late stage disease and in those undergoing treatment including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or surgery. VTE in patients with cancer is associated with a variety of adverse consequences including an increased risk of VTE recurrence, major bleeding, and early mortality. A VTE risk score for ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy has been extensively validated and has been used to select high risk patients for thromboprophylaxis trials. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of these trials have confirmed that LMWHs can significantly reduce the risk of VTE in patients with cancer. While the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved for the general population, previous guideline panels discouraged their use due to a lack of cancer-specific data. Recently RCTs for the treatment of established VTE in patients with cancer have demonstrated that the risk of recurrent VTE is lower while the risk of bleeding greater with DOACs compared to LMWH. Two thromboprophylaxis trials comparing low dose DOACs to placebo in high risk patients receiving cancer therapy have recently reported similar rates of VTE occurrence at 6 months in the control arms. A meta-analysis of the pooled results from these trials in higher risk ambulatory patients receiving cancer therapy confirmed a significant reduction in overall VTE incidence as well as pre-planned secondary outcomes on treatment. Several clinical practice guidelines addressing VTE in patients with malignant disease have been updated including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The addition of DOACs as an option for the management of VTE in patients with cancer is the latest major change to previous guidelines issued by these organizations. The updated recommendations from these guidelines are summarized in this review.

### Hemostasis and cancer: impact of haemostatic biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with cancer [^09563dc9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

2.6 Other cancer types

Hemostatic biomarkers were evaluated in various additional tumor types. In patients with ovarian cancer, the results of a meta‐analysis including data from 15 studies and 1437 patients suggest elevated baseline D‐dimer as prognostic biomarker for increased mortality (pooled HR: 1.32 [0.90–1.95], restricted to studies with n > 100: HR 1.80 [1.28–2.52]). A cohort study including 190 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer found an independent association with mortality of elevated pre‐treatment levels of D‐dimer (adj. HR: 1.64 [1.03–2.63]), platelet count (adj. HR: 1.64 [1.00–2.68]) and fibrinogen (adj. HR: 2.12 [1.32–3.41]), with conflicting data regarding PFS (adj. HR: D‐dimer: 1.23 [0.80–1.90], platelet count: 1.68 [1.08–2.62], fibrinogen: 1.71 [1.12–2.61]). In a small longitudinal analysis, the evolution of D‐dimer and CA‐125 levels were evaluated in 26 patients with ovarian cancer during systemic therapy, identifying the decrease in both markers as predictor for disease remission.

### Effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss during cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer [^1ee52ed9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynaecological cancer worldwide, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 women. Standard therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) includes a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery aims to remove as much of the visible tumour as possible. As extensive intraperitoneal metastases are typical of advanced EOC, cytoreductive surgery is usually an extensive procedure with the risk of excessive bleeding. Tranexamic acid given perioperatively is effective in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical settings. Therefore, tranexamic acid seems to be a promising agent for minimising blood loss and the need for blood transfusion among women with advanced EOC undergoing cytoreductive surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss associated with cytoreductive surgery in women with advanced EOC (stage III to IV).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to May 2015. We also checked registers of clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tranexamic acid given during surgery versus placebo or no treatment, in adult women diagnosed with advanced EOC.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (CK, AS) independently selected potentially relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This was a randomised double blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of intravenous tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg body weight) versus placebo, given immediately before surgery for reducing blood loss and the need for red blood cell transfusion. The mean total estimated blood loss was 668.34 mL and 916.93 mL for participants assigned to tranexamic acid and placebo groups, respectively. The mean difference (MD) of total estimated blood loss between the groups did not show a clinically important effect (MD - 248.59 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 550.9 to 53.79; one study, 100 participants; moderate quality evidence). The mean number of transfused units of blood components was not different between the two groups (low quality evidence). There were no noted differences in the incidence of reoperation, readmission or thromboembolic events (very low quality evidence). We considered the methodology of the included study to be at low risk of selection, detection, and reporting biases. However, we were concerned about an imbalance of some baseline characteristics between the groups, and as there was no protocol for blood transfusion, the rate of blood transfusion may vary depending on the practice of each participating hospital.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss in women undergoing cytoreductive surgery for advanced EOC, as only limited data are available from a single, low quality RCT at low overall risk of bias.

### Society of Family Planning committee statement: contraceptive considerations for individuals with cancer and cancer survivors part 1-key considerations for clinical care joint with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology [^d200c2cd]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer — overall contraceptive recommendations specify that for individuals with a history of or active ovarian cancer, we recommend clinicians provide access to all available contraceptive methods utilizing a person-centered approach (GRADE 1B); for individuals at high risk for ovarian cancer, we recommend clinicians offer hormonal contraception with the goal of ovarian suppression for ovarian cancer prevention (GRADE 1B); for hormonally-sensitive ovarian malignancies such as adult granulosa cell tumors, low-grade serous, and endometrioid adenocarcinomas, we suggest shared decision-making with the individual and their oncologist (GRADE 2C), and estrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided by individuals treated with estrogen-blocking therapy; given neutral or protective benefits, most individuals with a history of epithelial or borderline ovarian cancer with retained ovaries can safely use any hormonal contraceptive, and active ovarian cancer increases the risk of thrombosis.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^fa259445]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Targeted therapy for stage III and IV ovarian cancer — this guideline is using the term targeted therapy for bevacizumab and PARPi, and it presumes these are not available in basic- and limited-resource settings. A modest progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and no overall survival (OS) benefits were seen in randomized phase III trials incorporating bevacizumab into platinum-based doublets with continuation in maintenance, with greatest, albeit still modest, benefit observed in subsets with ascites or bulky residual disease. Bevacizumab can be offered for patients with high risk of disease (stage IV and suboptimal tumor cytoreduction stage III), but bevacizumab use should be limited to settings with the capacity to closely monitor and manage its known toxicities including hypertension, GI perforation, arterial or venous thromboembolism, or bleeding. Use of PARPi is recommended only in more-resourced settings and should follow the ASCO guidelines for use of PARPi in ovarian cancer. Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic settings and is not recommended in limited-resource settings because of issues of access and toxicity, including financial toxicity; for enhanced-resource settings, bevacizumab is an option, where feasible for appropriately selected stage III/IV patients, although cost and safety concerns with the management of toxicities may limit applicability.

### Exploring the therapeutic use and outcome of antibody-drug conjugates in ovarian cancer treatment [^0f2b5581]. Oncogene (2025). Medium credibility.

Tissue factor (TF)

Tissue Factor (TF), also known as coagulation factor III (F3), thromboplastin, or CD142, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is widely known to play a role in initiating extrinsic blood coagulation. It is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors. Notably, a significant proportion of ovarian cancer patients overexpress tissue factor, making it promising target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

### Thrombosis in ovarian cancer: a case control study [^dc6a4e45]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Up to 20% of patients with cancer will develop thromboembolic events and up to 20% of patients with thromboembolism have an underlying diagnosis of malignancy. Venous thromboembolic events affects up to 4.1% of patients with cancer admitted to hospital and thrombosis has been identified as a leading cause of death in patients with cancer. The true event burden is often underestimated as thrombotic events can be asymptomatic and venous thrombosis is detected in up to half of all cancer patients at post-mortem examinations.

Among solid tumours, ovarian cancer is associated with one of the highest incidence rates of venous thrombosis. Patients with ovarian cancer have several disease and treatment-related features that are well recognised as risk factors. The tumour arises within the pelvis and the majority of patients have advanced disease at presentation. Patients undergo abdomino-pelvic surgery as a part of the definitive treatment of the disease and the mainstay of systemic treatment is platinum-based chemotherapy. D-dimer levels are often elevated in ovarian cancer patients and some histological subtypes such as clear cell carcinomas are more prone to thrombotic events than others. The molecular basis for increased risk of thrombotic events is unclear but overexpression of tissue factor associated with elevated D-dimer levels is believed to be a major factor in promoting a hypercoagulable state in ovarian cancer.

Much of the data on the prognostic role of thrombotic events in solid tumours are confounded by studies that comprise heterogeneous patient populations of multiple cancer types, with varying disease and treatment-associated risk factors. Studies also vary in their evaluation of patients for thrombosis, either by screening for thrombotic events or by investigation of patients based upon clinical suspicion of thrombosis. The latter approach better reflects the current established clinical practice. In this study, we therefore aimed to chart the natural history of thrombotic events in patients with ovarian cancer throughout the course of their treatment. We also sought to define the risk factors for thrombosis, identify periods of high risk during the patient's lifetime and assess the impact of thrombosis on long-term survival, and to identify the proportion of thrombotic events that are detected following clinical findings or incidentally on routine imaging.

### High incidence of silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in ovarian cancer [^b23a9a76]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Management of VTE and cancer treatment

Anticoagulant therapy was performed before initial treatment and after upfront or interval debulking surgery for all 18 patients with VTE. In addition, we used placement of IVCF or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in eight of these patients according to severity of VTE, stage of ovarian cancer, expected histology of the tumour, cytological evidence of malignancy and performance status of patients. As a result, we managed patients with VTE as follows: (1) anticoagulant therapy alone in 10 patients including 2 patients with ovarian borderline malignancy; (2) upfront debulking surgery with placement of IVCF in 4 patients; and (3) neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by IDS in 4 patients.

As a result of these mentioned managements, none of these patients developed clinical manifestations of VTE after surgery.

Targeted therapy for patients with stage III and IV ovarian cancer (Recommendation 3.2.3 and 3.3.4)

Discussion

This guideline is using the term targeted therapy for bevacizumab and PARPi for the management of EOC. The guideline presumes that these are not available in basic- and limited-resource settings.

A modest PFS benefit and no OS benefits were seen in both randomized phase III trials examining incorporation of the antiangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, bevacizumab, to platinum-based doublets and continued in maintenance therapy. The subgroups for whom the greatest, albeit still modest, benefit was observed, on the basis of data from two large randomized clinical trials, GOG 0218 and ICON-7, were in subsets of patients with ascites or bulky residual disease. Bevacizumab can be offered for patients with high risk of disease (stage IV and suboptimal tumor cytoreduction stage III). Bevacizumab use should be limited to settings with the capacity to closely monitor and manage its known toxicities including hypertension, GI perforation, arterial or venous thromboembolism, or bleeding. Use of PARPi is recommended only in more-resourced settings and should follow the ASCO guidelines for use of PARPi in ovarian cancer.

Basic-resource settings

Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic settings.

Limited-resource settings

Targeted therapy is not recommended in limited-resource settings because of issues of access and toxicity, including financial toxicity.

Enhanced-resource settings

For enhanced settings, bevacizumab is an option, where feasible for appropriately selected stage III/IV patients. Cost and safety concerns with the management of toxicities may limit applicability.

### The efficacy of rosuvastatin to reduce circulating tissue factor extracellular vesicles after ovarian cancer surgery [^fc78609b]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Ovarian cancer is among the most prothrombotic tumor diagnoses. The postsurgical period in patients with ovarian cancer represents a confluence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) including major surgery, reduced mobility, high-risk primary malignancy, along with the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Extended pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for 30 days is considered standard of care for females undergoing laparotomy for ovarian cancer.

Tissue factor (TF)–bearing extracellular vesicles (EVs; TF+EVs) have been explored as a biomarker to predict thrombosis, specifically in cancer. Statins have been shown reduce EV generation by interfering with intracellular cytosol to membrane trafficking. Moreover, phase 3 trials support the efficacy of rosuvastatin to reduce VTE. Rosuvastatin is an attractive antithrombotic agent specifically in cancer, considering it does not carry inherent risks of bleeding. We hypothesized that rosuvastatin could reduce circulating EV after ovarian cancer surgery. We conducted a pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate dual rosuvastatin-enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis strategy for patients undergoing surgery for presumed ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma).

This study was approved by Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and this trial was registered at(identifier: NCT03532139). We consented adult females (aged > 18 years) undergoing pelvic or abdominal surgery with a histologic diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancers. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the supplemental Methods. Enrolled patients randomized to arm A received enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous daily for 30 days after surgery starting postoperative day 1. Patient randomized to arm B received 40 mg rosuvastatin orally daily from day 15 to day 60 after surgery (supplemental Figure 1). Patients declining randomization, were enrolled in arm C and received thromboprophylaxis per clinician discretion. Patients were to begin treatment in the postoperative setting as per hemostasis, no later than postoperative day 10.

Extended-duration prophylaxis after cancer surgery — For patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) who are undergoing cancer surgery, in-hospital dual thromboprophylaxis and extended-duration pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) after hospital discharge are recommended, and the American College of Chest Physicians recommends the use of extended-duration prophylaxis of 28 days for high-risk patients with cancer who are undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery by laparotomy. Among patients with cancer who develop a VTE, 40% will do so more than 21 days after surgery, and a prospective study of 2,373 cancer surgery patients assessed VTE up to 30 days after surgery in which 81.6% received in-hospital prophylaxis and 30.7% received extended prophylaxis; 50 patients (2.1%) had clinically overt VTE including isolated deep vein thrombosis in 10 patients (0.40%), nonfatal pulmonary embolism in 21 patients (0.88%), and death attributed to VTE in 19 cases (0.82%). A placebo-controlled trial showed that LMWH administered for 1 week versus 4 weeks postoperatively resulted in a 60% reduction in VTE with 4 weeks of treatment and no increase in bleeding, and prolonged prophylaxis using the LMWH enoxaparin has been found to be cost effective in ovarian cancer surgery.

### Variation in venous thromboembolism outcomes based on primary cancer site: a RIETE registry analysis [^c731b21f]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of the RIETE registry demonstrated that cancer patients with VTE have markedly higher risks of recurrence, major bleeding, and death compared to noncancer patients, consistent with previous research. Importantly, we found that these risks varied substantially by cancer site, emphasizing the need for more individualized approaches to anticoagulation in this population.

Patients with lung and pancreatic cancers had the highest risk for the composite outcome of fatal PE or VTE recurrence, with aHRs exceeding 3.0 compared to noncancer patients. This aligns with prior studies identifying and highlighting their high thrombotic potential, likely due to aggressive disease, frequent metastasis, and prothrombotic cancer therapies. While breast and GI cancers were also associated with increased VTE risk, their relative risk was less pronounced. These findings are hypothesis-generating and suggest that certain cancer types may warrant closer monitoring or further evaluation in future studies assessing tailored anticoagulation strategies.

We also found significantly higher risks of major bleeding in patients with GU, GI, and pancreatic cancers, which underscores the need for cautious anticoagulation management in these populations. These higher bleeding risks likely result from anatomic proximity to vascular structures, frequent invasive procedures, and cancer-related coagulopathies. This reinforces current guidelines that prefer DOACs over LMWH in patients with GI or GU cancers due to their more favorable safety profile., However, the observed differences in bleeding risks within these cancer sites suggest that even more personalized approaches might be needed, including choice of anticoagulant, dose adjustment or temporary interruptions, enhanced monitoring, and dynamic reassessment.

Subgroup analyses revealed specific nuances. Patients with ovarian or uterine cancer (GU group) had a particularly high risk of the composite outcome, while biliary malignancies (GI group) carried elevated risks for both VTE recurrence and bleeding. These findings suggest that even within broader cancer categories, the risk of the composite outcome and bleeding can vary based on the specific tumor site and location. Therefore, clinicians should consider not only the general cancer site but also the specific tumor characteristics when managing anticoagulation in cancer patients.

### Transforming treatment paradigms: focus on personalized medicine for high-grade serous ovarian cancer [^c4f6da99]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

High‐grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) stands as the most prevalent and deadly subtype among ovarian malignancies, characterized by its aggressive nature and high recurrence rates. HGSOC is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies in women worldwide and, among common gynecologic tumors, carries the highest case lethality. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2024, there will be approximately 19,680 new ovarian cancer cases and 12,740 ovarian cancer deaths in the United States. Epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 90% of cases, with high‐grade serous tumors having the poorest prognosis among the major subtypes. The low survival rates are primarily attributable to diagnoses at more advanced disease stages. Contemporary analyses have provided valuable insights into the molecular drivers and heterogeneity of this disease, paving the way for personalized and multimodal strategies. In addition, we recommend that these approaches be taken from a patient‐oriented perspective, as discussed below in detail. The symptoms and early signs of HGSOC are typically vague and nonspecific, contributing to the challenges in early detection (Figure 1). Common symptoms include abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, early satiety, and urinary urgency or frequency. These symptoms are often mistaken for benign conditions, such as gastrointestinal disorders, leading to diagnostic delays. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more pronounced and may include weight loss, fatigue, and changes in bowel habits. The insidious onset of symptoms underscores the importance of raising awareness and promoting early diagnostic initiatives to improve outcomes. It is noteworthy that thrombosis, paraneoplastic cerebellar symptoms, and paraneoplastic dermatitis are rare but well described presentations and should not be neglected or misinterpreted.

### OC-12-peri operative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in gynaecological cancer patients. A survey of current practice [^982ef7ba]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gynaecological cancer is associated with some of the highest rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with some subtypes of ovarian cancer associated with rates as high as 20%. VTE prophylaxis is an important part of post-operative management in gynaecological cancer patient care. Despite the evidence base and guidelines recommending extended VTE prophylaxis for patients undergoing major cancer surgery, adherence to best practice guidelines has been found to be low.

Aim

The aim of this study is to assess gynaecological oncologist's awareness of the guidelines surrounding VTE prophylaxis for post-operative gynaecological cancer patients and to determine the type and duration of VTE prophylaxis implemented by gynaecological oncologists.

Materials and Methods

The study used the European Society Gynaecology Oncology (ESGO) membership as the population studied. ESGO is a multidisciplinary, non-profit association, founded in 1983. ESGO consisit of more than 1800 professional of different specialities dealing with gynaecological oncology. The e mail address of 650 member were avilable on the ESGO website. We send a Survey Monkey link to the questionnaire by email to a total of 650 ESGO member whose email addresses were obtained from the ESGO directory. 205 e mails returned back as the email used was invalied, only 445 e mail successfully delivered. The survey remained open for 44 days. Results were analysed on Survey Monkey.

Results

A 59.3% of respondents said that they decided upon appropriate VTE prophylaxis for a patient according to national/international best practice guidelines. A further 39.4% respondents said that they made their choice based upon clinical judgement. 59.8% of respondents said that they begin VTE prophylaxis pre-operatively for the high risk patients. 6.1% said that they begin prophylaxis in the operating theatre, 18.9% begin prophylaxis 6 hours post-operatively and 9.1% begin prophylaxis 12 hours post-operatively. The remaining respondents said that they begin VTE more than 24 hours post operatively 44.7% said that they prescribe VTE prophylaxis for 4 weeks. A further 15.9% said that they prescribe VTE prophylaxis for 6 weeks and 4.75% for longer than 6 weeks.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the adherence to current guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in the peri-operative period for gynaecological oncology patients is still poor. Awareness needs to be raised in order to decrease the morbidity/mortality of VTE in this high risk group of patients. The adoption of multidiscplinary approach to manage gynaecological cancer patients, which includes the involvment of thrombosis specialist, may reduce post operative VTE rates and improve cancer care.

### First-in-human phase 1 open label study of the BET inhibitor ODM-207 in patients with selected solid tumours [^19701b2f]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and drug administration

Patients in the dose escalation part received oral ODM-207 once daily in a 28-day cycle at a starting dose of a 50 mg tablet daily under fed conditions. The starting dose was chosen as it was reasonably expected to be both pharmacologically active and safe and tolerable. The target exposure for the starting dose was estimated from exposures observed in pre-clinical anti-tumour activity and safety studies. The estimated human dose required was predicted by both human equivalent dose calculations and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling. A single dose titration procedure was performed in the first cohort of patients to confirm that exposure of ODM-207 in humans corresponded with the pre-defined target exposure based on non-clinical data. The starting dose provided plasma exposure that was in the target range. Therefore, no further dose titration in the first cohort was pursued (Fig. S1). Treatment was taken in the ambulatory setting, except for hospital admissions required for pre-specified study-related procedures.

Eligible patients had histologically confirmed NMC, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, HER2 negative breast cancer, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma or any other tumour predicted to have a significantly higher likelihood of response to ODM-207 (such as MYC amplified tumours), with no effective standard therapy available. Patients had to have ECOG performance status ≤ 1, adequate haematopoietic, renal, hepatic and coagulation function, life expectancy > 12 weeks and needed a washout period from prior anti-cancer therapy.

### Guidelines for the management of cancer and thrombosis-special aspects in women [^8d1601ca]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is associated with unfavorable prognosis, and VTE treatment is less effective and more complicated in cancer patients. Several women specific aspects related to the underlying cancer type and VTE management need to be considered.

Methods

Guidelines on VTE prevention and treatment in cancer patients issued from several international bodies are reviewed with respect to women specific recommendations, and general guideline recommendations are summarized.

Results

All guidelines recommend an initial parenteral treatment, preferably with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), while fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can also be used. Long-term treatment, comprising 3 to 6 months after initial anticoagulation should preferably be performed with LMWH, or vitamin K antagonists (VKA), if LMWH is not available. For extended treatment beyond six months, there are no specific recommendations due to lack of evidence, and anticoagulation can be performed with LMWH or VKA. Novel or non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been studied in several trials in comparison to VKA in VTE patients, including 3–9% cancer patients. While NOACs showed comparable efficacy and safety to VKA in those cancer patients, results from trials comparing NOACs with LMWH are not available. Because of the paucity of data, there are no guideline recommendations for women specific cancer types or women specific issues in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

Conclusions

While there is agreement on general VTE management in cancer patients across different international guidelines, there is insufficient guidance on many women specific aspects commonly encountered during clinical practice. Future trials are required that specifically and prospectively address women specific issues in the management of VTE in cancer.

### Arterial thrombosis in a gynecologic oncology patient: evaluation and management [^519cce69]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Arterial thrombosis is an extremely rare complication in gynecologic oncology with only two cases previously reported in the literature. Presentation, evaluation, and treatment varied considerably in all previous reports of arterial thrombosis associated with any malignancy.

Case

We report a case of discontinuous arterial thrombosis in the upper extremity of a patient with fallopian tube cancer. Her initial evaluation, done in the acute setting of the thrombosis, revealed multiple thrombophilia abnormalities, including an elevated Factor VIII, and a borderline positive lupus anticoagulant. Follow-up studies over 2 years showed resolution of all coagulation abnormalities, thus indicating no genetic propensity for thrombosis.

Conclusion

This case highlights the need for appropriate timing of the initial laboratory studies and follow-up so that patients can be managed appropriately.

### Guidelines for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer [^68028fdb]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The association between cancer and thrombosis has been recognized for more than 150 years. Not only are patients with cancer at a substantially increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), the link between several coagulation factors and tumor growth, invasion, and the development of metastases has been established. Reported rates of VTE in patients with cancer have increased in recent years likely reflecting, in part, improved diagnosis with sophisticated imaging techniques as well as the impact of more aggressive cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Various therapeutic interventions, such as surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapeutic strategies as well as the frequent use of indwelling catheters and other invasive procedures also place cancer patients at increased risk of VTE. The increasing risk of VTE, the multitude of risk factors, and the greater risk of VTE recurrence and death among patients with cancer represent considerable challenges in modern clinical oncology. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) originally developed guidelines for VTE in patients with cancer in 2007. ASCO recently updated clinical practice guidelines on the treatment and prevention of VTE in patients with cancer following an extensive systematic review of the literature. Revised 2013 guidelines have now been presented and will be discussed in this review. Although several new studies were identified and considered, many important questions remain regarding the relationship between thrombosis and cancer and the optimal care of patients at risk for VTE.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in patients with cancer. Therefore, tailoring anticoagulation is of utmost importance to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE while minimizing the risk of bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants have been recently compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the management of acute cancer-associated thrombosis. Although direct oral anticoagulants are a welcome addition, clinicians need to incorporate clinical characteristics, drug-drug interactions, and patient preference in decision making.

### Optimal primary therapy of ovarian cancer [^e67516e6]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Epithelial ovarian cancer continues to have the highest case-fatality ratio of all gynecologic cancers, in spite of ongoing advances in risk-assessment, genomics, tumor biology, cytoreductive surgery, chemotherapy, and molecular-targeted interventions. Primary treatment options for advanced-stage disease not only should reflect current best standards, but also need to be tailored for individual patients, with consideration of local resources.

Methods

Formulation of recommendations for optimal primary therapy based on a selective review of data from completed randomized trials, analysis of ongoing trials, and integration with current tumor biology, within the context of individualized clinical care. Recommendations were presented for discussion during an international meeting of experts in ovarian cancer treatment.

Results

Key recommendations include full adjuvant therapy for early-stage high-grade serous cancer; tailored utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on patient comorbidities, extent of disease, and likelihood of achieving optimal surgical cytoreduction; preferred utilization of carboplatin with weekly paclitaxel as primary therapy; consideration of intraperitoneal cisplatin-based therapy in appropriate patients; avoidance of maintenance chemotherapy; lack of necessity for bevacizumab during primary chemotherapy and primary maintenance; acknowledgement of research opportunities and priorities.

Conclusions

Integrated multidisciplinary care, including cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, remain central to the optimal management of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. However, even with recent technical advances, the impact on disease-related mortality is limited, and more attention will be focused on the early integration of research, particularly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreductive surgery.

### Indications for and complications of transfusion and the management of gynecologic malignancies [^0409ae83]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia, which is highly prevalent in oncology patients, is one of the most established negative prognostic factors for several gynecologic malignancies. Multiple factors can cause or contribute to the development of anemia in patients with gynecologic cancers; these factors include blood loss (during surgery or directly from the tumor), renal impairment (caused by platinum-based chemotherapy), and marrow dysfunction (from metastases, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy). Several peri- and intra-operative strategies can be used to optimize patient management and minimize blood loss related to surgery. Blood transfusions are routinely employed as corrective measures against anemia; however, blood transfusions are one of the most overused healthcare interventions. There are safe and effective evidence-based blood transfusion strategies used in other patient populations that warrant further investigation in the surgical oncology setting. Blood is a valuable healthcare resource, and clinicians can learn to use it more judiciously through knowledge of the potential risks and complications of blood interventions, as well as the ability to properly identify the patients most likely to benefit from such interventions.

### Effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban compared with low-molecular-weight heparin in cancer-associated thromboembolism [^b5957ea7]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines provide differing recommendations regarding direct-acting oral anticoagulants vs low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban vs LMWH for treatment of CAT. Using US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare-linked data from 2013 through 2016, we evaluated adults with active breast, lung, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer, who were admitted to the hospital or treated in the emergency department for CAT and were prescribed rivaroxaban or LMWH for outpatient anticoagulation. Patients with luminal gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers were excluded. Rivaroxaban and LMWH users were 1:1 propensity score matched. Outcomes included the composite of recurrent thrombosis or major bleeding, each outcome separately, and mortality at 6 months, using an intent-to-treat approach. On-treatment analysis after 12 months was also performed. Proportional hazards models for the subdistribution of competing risk were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 529 rivaroxaban- and 529 LMWH-treated patients with CAT. Rivaroxaban was not associated with differences in risk of the composite outcome (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41–1.22), major bleeding (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.50–2.01), or mortality (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70–1.07) vs LMWH, but it reduced recurrent thrombosis (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–0.95). On-treatment analysis at 12 months showed similar results. Rivaroxaban may be a reasonable alternative to LMWH for patients with CAT without gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.

### Return to intended oncological therapy following advanced ovarian cancer surgery: a narrative review [^f46c0a2f]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Return to intended oncological therapy is a promising metric for evaluating patients' functional recovery after surgery and their readiness for adjuvant therapies. Despite its relevance in assessing the safety and efficacy of cancer treatments, it requires standardisation and validation, as current definitions and assessments vary widely across studies. Following ovarian cancer surgery, the decision on when to RIOT needs to balance the duration required for adequate postoperative recovery and timely commencement of chemotherapy (which has been found to improve oncologic outcome). Usually, chemotherapy is given around 4 weeks after ovarian cancer surgery, and preferably within 6 weeks. Peri‐operative optimisation of patients undergoing ovarian cancer surgery with multidisciplinary team involvement, appropriate oncoanaesthesia interventions, meticulous surgical technique, postoperative care utilising ERAS programmes, and effective management of psychological distress are essential to allow prompt RIOT.

Cancer-associated thrombosis remains a significant complication in the clinical management of cancer and interactions of the hemostatic system with cancer biology continue to be elucidated. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of tissue factor (TF) regulation and procoagulant activation, TF signaling in cancer and immune cells, and the expanding roles of the coagulation system in stem cell niches and the tumor microenvironment. The extravascular functions of coagulant and anti-coagulant pathways have significant implications not only for tumor progression, but also for the selection of appropriate target specific anticoagulants in the therapy of cancer patients.

Regarding medical management for cancer-associated thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, initiation/treatment phase, ITAC 2022 guidelines recommend to administer LMWH for the initial treatment of established VTE in patients with cancer and a CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min.
Administer LMWH once daily unless a twice-per-day regimen is required because of the patient's characteristics, such as the risk of bleeding or moderate renal failure, or the need for technical intervention, such as surgery or changing regimen. Use only enoxaparin 1 mg/kg when a twice-per-day regimen is required.

Efficacy & Safety of Olvi-Vec and Platinum-doublet + Bevacizumab Compared to Physician's Choice of Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Platinum-Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer. The OnPrime study is a multi-center, randomized open-label phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Olvi-Vec followed by platinum-doublet chemotherapy and bevacizumab compared to the Active Comparator Arm with Physician's Choice of chemotherapy and bevacizumab in women diagnosed with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. This Phase III trial builds on the efficacy and safety data reported in the previous Phase II VIRO-15 trial with promising objective response rate and progression-free survival observed in heavily pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.

The phase II results also showed that the intra-peritoneal route of delivery was efficient in generating tumor cell killing and immune activation, and led to clinical reversal of platinum-resistance or refractoriness in this difficult-to-treat patient population. Inclusion Criteria
- Histologically confirmed non-resectable ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.
- High-grade serous, endometrioid, or clear-cell ovarian cancer.
- Performance status ECOG of 0 or 1.
- Life expectancy of at least 6 months.
- Received a minimum of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy with no maximal limit. the combination of Olvi-Vec followed by further chemotherapy is particularly effective against established tumors by virus-mediated immune activation and re-sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapy.

### Defining practice patterns in gynecologic oncology to prevent pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis [^7e8b4c4a]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the development of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Because women with gynecologic cancers are at high risk to develop VTE, we sought to determine the present practice patterns of gynecologic oncologists regarding their use of VTE prophylaxis.

Methods

1073 members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO) were mailed surveys that asked about preferred methods to prevent the development of VTE after gynecologic oncology surgery. Data were collected by online member entry and return mail. Frequency distributions were calculated and nonparametric test used for comparisons.

Results

343/1073 (34%) of SGO members and fellows responded. 142/343 (42%) preferred double prophylaxis consisting of external pneumatic compression (EPC) and an anticoagulant while 41% (n = 141) preferred EPC with no additional anticoagulation. Of respondents choosing any anticoagulant, 40% preferred Enoxaparin pre- and/or postoperatively. Ovarian cancer patients were perceived by respondents to have the highest risk of developing a postoperative PE.

Conclusions

Most respondents agree that women with gynecologic cancers undergoing major surgery should receive VTE prophylaxis, though there is not agreement as to which method is optimal. While 42% of members preferred double prophylaxis, 41% chose no additional measures other than EPC. Randomized studies in gynecologic oncology should be initiated in the United States to determine the optimal practice pattern.

### Do differences in baseline clinical severity of ovarian cancer patients with thrombosis predict treatment with rivaroxaban versus low molecular-weight heparin? [^533f6a1b]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract e18748 Background: Prescribers use direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular-weight heparin for the acute treatment and secondary prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis. We sought to identify predictors impacting the use rivaroxaban versus LMWH for CAT in patients with ovarian cancer. Methods: Using US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result-Medicare linked data from 2013–2016, we evaluated adults with ovarian cancer, undergoing hospitalization/emergency department admission for CAT and prescribed rivaroxaban or LMWH for outpatient anticoagulation. Univariate analysis was performed to examine the association between covariates and clinicians' choice to use rivaroxaban or LMWH. Variables with a p-value < 0. 20 upon univariate analysis were deemed significant and subsequently included into a stepwise, backwards multivariable logistic regression model to obtain adjusted odd ratios of treatment assignment.

Results: Of the 125 ovarian cancer patients included in our analysis, 26% received rivaroxaban and 74% LMWH. All patients had stage 3 or 4 ovarian cancer, 36% were ≥ 75 years-of-age, 78% were white, and 18% were below the poverty line. Upon univariate analysis, rural community, time between cancer diagnosis and VTE ≥ 1 year, index VTE without evidence of pulmonary embolism, and CKD ≥ stage 3 were found to be significant predictors of rivaroxaban use when compared to LMWH. Upon multivariable regression, CKD ≥ stage 3 was shown to be independently associated with rivaroxaban versus LMWH use. Conclusions: In routine practice, patients were more likely to receive rivaroxaban if they had CKD and lived in a rural area. These differences in prescribing practices may be due to less availability of LMWH in rural areas and less tolerance of injections in CKD patients. Univariate analysis also suggest that low VTE burden and VTE event ≥ 1 year after cancer diagnosis were also associated with rivaroxaban use over LMWH, which may be due to LMWH therapy as the long-established standard of care for patients with cancer.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^48ce21ee]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

At the time of the systematic searches for high-quality existing guidelines for this ASCO resource-stratified guideline, there were multiple existing guidelines from maximal settings (see the Data Supplement). Four of the non-ASCO guidelines and all the adapted ASCO guidelines (including the guideline of ASCO and SGO) used systematic review–based methods. Two of the guidelines found were not traditionally systematic review–based. The key evidence the guidelines used included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, nonsystematic literature reviews, existing guidelines, observational studies, and consensus. Most of the evidence regarded systemic therapy. In some areas regarding other interventions, the guidelines used observational data. Therefore, many recommendations in this ASCO guideline were informed by this variety of expert-reviewed data and then validated by Formal Consensus.

The outcomes or end points in most studies reviewed by the adapted guidelines included efficacy (including overall survival and progression-free survival [PFS]), quality of life (QoL), safety and/or adverse events, and in some cases, cost-effectiveness.

### Update on guidelines for the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis [^da1cb2e7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with cancer are at high risk of developing arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). They constitute 15% to 20% of the patients diagnosed with VTE. Depending on the type of tumor, cancer therapy, and presence of other risk factors, 1% to 25% of patients with cancer will develop thrombosis. The decision to start patients with cancer on primary thromboprophylaxis depends on patient preference, balancing risk of bleeding versus risk of thrombosis, cost, and adequate organ function. Currently, guidelines recommend against the use of routine primary thromboprophylaxis in unselected ambulatory patients with cancer. Validated risk assessment models can accurately identify patients at highest risk for cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). This review summarizes the recently updated NCCN Guidelines for CAT primary prophylaxis, with a primarily focus on VTE prevention. Two main clinical questions that providers commonly encounter will also be addressed: which patients with cancer should receive primary thromboprophylaxis (both surgical and medical oncology patients) and how to safely choose between different anticoagulation agents.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^e90b71ab]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Systemic therapy is the cornerstone of managing patients with recurrent disease. Approaches to recurrent disease will vary with resource availability to multiple chemotherapy agents, location and severity of recurrence, and prior treatment exposures. Recurrent disease is not amenable to cure but patients with platinum sensitivity have improved PFS and OS when re-treated with platinum-based single-agent or doublet therapy. Few if any opportunities may be available to women with recurrent disease in basic-resourced areas and palliative care may be the only option. Surgery is not recommended except in select patients who had complete resection at up-front surgery, long recurrence-free survival, and limited disease at re-presentation. Decisions for surgery in recurrent EOC must take into account patient risk factors, access to qualified surgical capacity, system-based resources, and access to second-line chemotherapy agents. Systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapy recommendations depend upon resource support and platinum-free interval (Table 8).

TABLE 8
Risk-Stratified Groups

Cost, access, and safety issues with targeted therapies such as bevacizumab are of concern in limited and enhanced settings, although there may be benefits in management of ascites. Bowel perforation, thromboembolism, fatigue, and hypertension are grade 3 and 4 toxicities occurring in patients receiving bevacizumab and are of grave concern, especially in weaker health systems. Clinical trials and newer targeted agents may be available in some limited and enhanced settings. Patients should be referred to higher-resourced settings for these and other opportunities when eligible and feasible.

Patients in the platinum-resistant group do not derive benefit from platinum rechallenge. The current standard of care outside of a clinical trial is single-agent non–platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in maximal settings. An exception is the use of hormonal therapy for recurrent low-grade serous (and low-grade endometrioid) ovarian cancer, where the pathologic diagnosis and grade are confirmed. The platinum-refractory group has a poor prognosis with short disease-free intervals and should be managed with palliative intent (Table 7).

(Sources: BCGS, OH-CCO, JSGO, SIGN)

Basic-resource settings

Palliative care involvement, if not already initiated, should be the primary focus alone or along with referral to higher-resourced settings.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism in gynecologic oncology surgery [^0e0c4638]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gynecologic oncology patients are at a high-risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism and these events are a source of major morbidity and mortality. Given the availability of prophylaxis regimens, a structured comprehensive plan for prophylaxis is necessary to care for this population. There are many prophylaxis strategies and pharmacologic agents available to the practicing gynecologic oncologist. Current venous thromboembolism prophylaxis strategies include mechanical prophylaxis, preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis, postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis and extended duration pharmacologic prophylaxis that the patient continues at home after hospital discharge. In this review, we will summarize the available pharmacologic prophylaxis agents and discuss currently used prophylaxis strategies. When available, evidence from the gynecologic oncology patient population will be highlighted.

### NCT01146795 | Neoadjuvant therapy for ovarian cancer… [^d730cfd4]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Therapy for Ovarian CancerClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Initial treatment for ovarian cancer is usually surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant platinum and taxane chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis over 75% of patients present with stage III or IV disease that has spread into the peritoneal cavity or distally. Despite a number of new chemotherapeutic regimens survival has improved only modestly over the preceding two decades. While overall 5-year survival has improved from 30% to 50%, 5-year survival remains only 25% for women with advanced stage disease. Given these findings it is clear that improved strategies for the delivery of cytotoxic and biologic agents are needed for women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update 2014 [^057ee188]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide current recommendations about the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines from November 2012 through July 2014. An update committee reviewed the identified abstracts.

Results

Of the 53 publications identified and reviewed, none prompted a change in the 2013 recommendations.

Recommendations

Most hospitalized patients with active cancer require thromboprophylaxis throughout hospitalization. Routine thromboprophylaxis is not recommended for patients with cancer in the outpatient setting. It may be considered for selected high-risk patients. Patients with multiple myeloma receiving antiangiogenesis agents with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone should receive prophylaxis with either low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or low-dose aspirin. Patients undergoing major surgery should receive prophylaxis starting before surgery and continuing for at least 7 to 10 days. Extending prophylaxis up to 4 weeks should be considered in those undergoing major abdominal or pelvic surgery with high-risk features. LMWH is recommended for the initial 5 to 10 days of treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as for long-term secondary prophylaxis (at least 6 months). Use of novel oral anticoagulants is not currently recommended for patients with malignancy and VTE because of limited data in patients with cancer. Anticoagulation should not be used to extend survival of patients with cancer in the absence of other indications. Patients with cancer should be periodically assessed for VTE risk. Oncology professionals should educate patients about the signs and symptoms of VTE.

### Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis [^b82e266d]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer remain very limited. Although low-molecular-weight heparin monotherapy has been identified as a simple and efficacious regimen compared with an initial parenteral anticoagulant followed by long-term therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, many clinical questions remain unanswered. These include optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy, treatment of recurrent VTE, and the treatment of patients with concurrent bleeding or those with a high risk of bleeding. Treatment recommendations from consensus clinical guidelines are largely based on retrospective reports or extrapolated data from the noncancer population with VTE, as randomized controlled trials focused on cancer-associated thrombosis are sorely lacking. Furthermore, with improvements in imaging technology and extended survival duration of patients with cancer, we are encountering more unique challenges, such as the management of incidental VTE. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the novel oral anticoagulants and avoid the use of these agents because of the paucity of evidence in the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis.

### Anticoagulation with a selective thrombin inhibitor in a woman with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^f8dd1692]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an immunologic complication of heparin therapy with potentially serious venous and arterial thrombotic sequelae. Progression to overt thrombosis is the most serious complication, occurring in approximately 0.5% of heparin-treated patients. Previous strategies for treatment of the associated thrombosis with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have frustrated clinicians with poor outcomes.

Case

A 45-year-old woman with stage IB endometrial cancer underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy. She suffered a pulmonary embolism postoperatively. The pulmonary embolism was treated with heparin, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and central vein catheter-related thrombosis developed. She underwent thrombectomy and was successfully anticoagulated with a selective thrombin inhibitor instead of heparin.

Conclusion

This treatment should be considered for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in either a prophylactic or a treatment regimen.

### Enoxaparin with or without rosuvastatin calcium in… [^1c6258f8]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin with or without Rosuvastatin Calcium in Preventing Blood Clots in Patients with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer following Surgery. This phase I trial studies how well with or without rosuvastatin calcium work in preventing blood clots in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer after surgery. Enoxaparin prevents blood clots. Rosuvastatin calcium is an anti-cholesterol medication that lowers cholesterol and may reduce the risk of arterial blood clots. Giving rosuvastatin calcium and enoxaparin may work better in preventing blood clots in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer following ovarian cancer surgery.
- Alanine aminotransferase = < 1. 5 x institutional upper limit of normal. Additional locations may be listed on ClinicalTrials. gov for NCT03532139. See trial information on ClinicalTrials. gov for a list of participating sites.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate whether rosuvastatin calcium in combination with enoxaparin lowers levels of circulating TFMP compared with enoxaparin alone or standard-of-care thromboprophylaxis following laparotomy for ovarian cancer at 60 days. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Point estimate of the rates of venous thromboembolism following ovarian surgery receiving enoxaparin alone and enoxaparin with rosuvastatin at 15 and 60 days. II. Comparison of D-dimer values at 30 and 60 days for enoxaparin/rosuvastatin with enoxaparin alone and/or standard of care. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients receive enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily on days 1–30 following surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive enoxaparin SC QD on days 1–30 and rosuvastatin calcium orally QD on days 15–60 following surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Background

Gynaecological cancers are associated with high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Studies on ambulatory cancer patients do not support thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy. Approximately 6–7% of gynaecological cancer patients suffer a postoperative VTE despite Low Molecular Weight Heparin prophylaxis (LMWH). Large cancer studies have shown that Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) and Microparticles (MP) assays may be useful in predicting VTE but data on gynaecological cancer patients is scarce.

Objective

Our objective was to identify whether the CAT assay and MP functional assays have potential as biomarkers predictive of VTE in gynaecological cancer patients.

Patients and Methods

Gynaecological cancer patients were investigated before surgery (n = 146) and at 5, 14 and 42days post-surgery (n = 78). Fourteen additional patients were investigated before chemotherapy and after 3 and 6 cycles of therapy. Thrombin generation was measured before and after addition of thrombomodulin.

Results

Patients with clear cell cancer (CCC) of the ovary and patients with endometrial cancer had higher ETP and peak thrombin compared with patients with benign disease. Patients who developed VTE (n = 8) following surgery had enhanced thrombin generation prior to surgery which persisted during the post-operative period despite LMWH prophylaxis. Both neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy showed increased thrombin generation following addition of thrombomodulin. There were no differences in MP levels during the study.

Conclusions

CAT assay shows potential as a promising biomarker for the prediction of VTE in gynaecological cancer patients. The identification of high risk patients combined with individualised LMWH prophylaxis might reduce VTE in this high risk group.

NCCN ovarian cancer — general principles of systemic therapy emphasize trial participation, pretreatment evaluation, supportive care, and evidence qualifications. Patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials, and before chemotherapy, requirements for adequate organ function and performance status should be met. Before any therapy, all patients with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist to determine candidacy for primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS); patients of childbearing potential desiring fertility-sparing procedures should be referred to an appropriate fertility specialist. Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed. Consider scalp cooling to reduce alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy with high rates of alopecia. During chemotherapy, patients should be observed closely with blood chemistry monitoring and appropriate dose reductions or modifications based on toxicities and goals of therapy, and after completion should be assessed for response and monitored for long-term complications. Chemosensitivity/resistance and other biomarker assays are used at some institutions, but the current level of evidence is not sufficient to support standard-of-care chemotherapy (category 3). An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Postoperative therapy selection and monitoring — epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer — should be discussed prior to the initiation of therapy, and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Chemosensitivity/resistance and/or other biomarker assays have been proposed, but the current level of evidence is not sufficient to supplant standard-of-care chemotherapy (category 3), and prior to recommending chemotherapy, requirements for adequate organ function and performance status should be met. During drug-based therapy, patients should be observed closely and treated for any complications, appropriate blood chemistry tests should be monitored, and appropriate dose reductions and modifications of chemotherapy should be performed depending on toxicities experienced and goals of therapy. Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy with high rates of alopecia.

ASH 2021 VTE in cancer — DOACs versus LMWH harms and use considerations: Compared with LMWH, DOACs (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) may increase major bleeding, and the panel judged the effects to be small (for major bleeding: RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.83–2.02; ARI, 10 more per 1000; 95% CI, 6 fewer to 36 more per 1000). The risk of bleeding associated with DOACs appears to vary with cancer type and the type of DOAC, with a threefold to fourfold higher risk reported for patients with GI cancers. DOACs are not appropriate in some settings, including severe renal dysfunction defined as creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, pregnancy and lactation, and drug-drug interactions. For short-term treatment of VTE in cancer, only the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban were evaluated; there are no data for the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran for this indication, and DOACs should be used very carefully in this patient population.

### Treatment of ovarian epithelial, fallopian,&peritoneal cancers-NCI… [^1f19b483]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian epithelial cancer.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Targeted therapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Radiation therapy
- Immunotherapy
- Treatment for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Follow-up care may be needed. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody and angiogenesis inhibitor that may be used with chemotherapy to treat ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred. It binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer.
- Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Lymph nodes and other tissues in the pelvis and abdomen are removed and checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Surgery is followed by one of the following:

- Intravenous chemotherapy.
- Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
- Chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
- Chemotherapy and targeted therapy with a poly polymerase inhibitor.
- Chemotherapy and targeted therapy followed by surgery.
- Chemotherapy and hyperthermic peritoneal chemotherapy followed by surgery.
- Chemotherapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery.
- Targeted therapy with a PARP inhibitor. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.

General information about clinical trials is also available.
- Chemotherapy using one or more anticancer drugs.
- Targeted therapy with a poly polymerase inhibitor with or without chemotherapy.
- Chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy.

### The treatment of cancer associated thrombosis: does one size fit all? Who should get LMWH / warfarin / DOACs? [^88bb198b]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Whilst the term cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) offers an overarching term for all thrombotic events encountered during the cancer journey, the reality is that this is a far too simplistic reflection of a complex multifactorial process occurring within a heterogeneous population. The management of CAT needs to consider factors beyond the thrombus itself: patients must be treated as individuals within the context of their own cancer journey and their preferences for different treatment options. The breath of pathological, pharmacological and psychosocial variants means it is highly unlikely that one treatment regime will be appropriate for all patients. It is inevitable that regimes may need to be modified and anticoagulant agents changed according to clinical and patient preference needs. There is strong evidence supporting the use of low molecular weight heparin first line in the treatment of acute CAT. The evidence for warfarin and the direct acting oral anticoagulants is not as strong but, as oral agents, may be preferred by some patients. This paper shall identify the various treatment options available, factors which will influence the decision making process and when it is justifiable to treat patients differently to the established protocol.
