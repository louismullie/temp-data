## Question

Does afib cause troponin elevation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atrial fibrillation (AF) causes troponin elevation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct evidence that AF is associated with elevated troponin. Then, I should verify the proposed mechanisms, including rate-related supply–demand mismatch, atrial myocyte injury, and neurohormonal activation. Next, I will review how high-sensitivity assays change detection and why specificity is limited. After that, I should examine prognostic implications and whether elevated troponin in AF still matters. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach to distinguishing type 1 MI from AF-related myocardial injury and outline management implications [^117GMN3p].

> Let me first confirm the association itself. Multiple large cohorts show that patients with AF frequently have detectable or elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, even outside an acute coronary syndrome. In the ARISTOTLE biomarker substudy, hs‑troponin I was detected in 98.5% of anticoagulated AF patients, with 9.2% above the 99th percentile, and higher levels independently predicted stroke, cardiac death, and major bleeding, indicating both high prevalence and prognostic relevance [^114ztLHD]. Similarly, in the RE‑LY substudy, persistent or elevated troponin identified a higher-risk AF subgroup for thromboembolism and death, reinforcing the link between troponin and adverse outcomes in AF populations [^116Qf7CG]. Hold on, I should verify that this isn't just a trial phenomenon; real‑world emergency cohorts also show that troponin elevation is common in AF and correlates with worse outcomes, including mortality, supporting external validity [^111MW5gU] [^1127nEJr].

> Now, I need to check the mechanisms. AF can precipitate a supply–demand mismatch when rapid ventricular response increases myocardial oxygen consumption and shortens diastolic filling time, leading to type 2 myocardial injury rather than plaque rupture; this is particularly plausible in patients with underlying coronary disease or ventricular hypertrophy [^117GMN3p]. Wait, let me verify the rate threshold where this becomes clinically apparent; the Tropo‑AF analysis found a nonlinear association between heart rate and hs‑cTnT, with a notable inflection around 125 bpm, suggesting that faster rates are more likely to provoke measurable troponin release in AF [^113dW5n8]. But I should also consider atrial myocyte biology; AF is characterized by atrial fibrosis and remodeling, and although atrial myocytes are not classic contractile fibers, emerging data suggest they can release troponin during stress or injury, offering a direct atrial source of troponin in AF beyond ventricular ischemia [^111j6xaW]. Finally, neurohormonal activation with catecholamine surges and RAAS stimulation can injure cardiomyocytes and elevate troponin, a mechanism well described in tachyarrhythmias and supported by observational links between AF, stroke, and troponin elevation via sympathetic pathways [^11769HHQ] [^117Mhsv9].

> Next, I should review how assay sensitivity changes interpretation. High‑sensitivity assays detect troponin in most people, so "positivity" above the 99th percentile is more frequent and less specific for type 1 MI in AF; specificity falls and false positives rise if we apply standard ACS cutoffs without clinical context [^114ztLHD]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; studies in suspected ACS with chronic AF show that using the 99th percentile alone yields only moderate positive predictive value for obstructive CAD, whereas optimized higher thresholds and incorporation of 3‑hour delta improve rule‑in performance, highlighting the need for kinetic criteria in this setting [^114ZxR63] [^111y6ZES] [^113vTE8P]. I should double‑check that guideline frameworks acknowledge this; the universal MI definition cautions that tachyarrhythmias, including AF with rapid ventricular response, can produce troponin elevation from supply–demand mismatch and that ST‑T changes may reflect cardiac memory rather than ischemia, reinforcing the need for integrated clinical, ECG, and biomarker kinetics before labeling a type 2 MI in AF [^117GMN3p].

> I will now examine prognostic significance, because even if AF can "cause" troponin elevation, the prognostic signal still matters. Elevated troponin in AF consistently tracks with higher all‑cause mortality, stroke or systemic embolism, heart failure, and cardiovascular death across randomized trial cohorts and observational studies, and this risk appears graded across troponin levels, not merely dichotomous [^114ztLHD] [^116Qf7CG]. Let me verify the shape of the risk curve; the large TROP‑AF cohort showed a nonlinear relationship with mortality that rises above the upper limit of normal and continues upward with higher troponin multiples, supporting the concept that the magnitude of troponin reflects underlying myocardial vulnerability and possibly occult CAD amenable to intervention [^116iTKxW]. But wait, what if clinicians ignore small elevations; indeed, angiography is rarely pursued at modest troponin levels in AF, yet patients who do undergo angiography have lower mortality, suggesting that part of the prognostic pathway may be mediated by treatable CAD uncovered at higher troponin levels [^1131ecs4].

> Hold on, I should verify how to distinguish AF‑related injury from type 1 MI in practice. The universal definition advises that in AF with rapid ventricular response, new ST‑segment depression or T‑wave inversion alone should not automatically trigger a type 2 MI label; instead, clinicians should integrate ischemic symptoms, timing relative to AF onset, a rising and/or falling troponin pattern, and imaging or angiographic evidence before assigning an MI diagnosis [^117GMN3p]. Let me reconsider the role of delta; serial measurements and delta criteria improve specificity for type 1 MI in AF, and some studies propose slightly higher troponin thresholds or delta cutoffs in chronic AF to optimize rule‑in performance, though these are not yet standardized and should be interpreted within institutional assay characteristics [^111y6ZES] [^113vTE8P]. I need to ensure I emphasize that a stable, chronic troponin elevation in AF may reflect structural heart disease or ongoing strain rather than an acute coronary event, so trending and clinical correlation are essential to avoid misclassification [^117GMN3p].

> Next, I should review management implications. First, optimize rate and rhythm control because faster ventricular rates are linked to troponin release; rate‑lowering therapy can reduce troponin levels in permanent AF, and aggressive rate control is reasonable when troponin is elevated in the setting of rapid AF, with close monitoring for downtrend [^113ViaFq]. Second, do not dismiss an elevated troponin in AF as benign; use it as a risk marker that prompts evaluation for CAD, heart failure, and other contributors, escalating to coronary angiography when the troponin rise is large, dynamic, or accompanied by ischemic symptoms or ECG changes suggestive of type 1 MI or high‑risk CAD [^111MW5gU] [^117GMN3p]. Third, integrate biomarkers into broader risk stratification; the ABC stroke risk score incorporates hs‑troponin and NT‑proBNP and outperforms CHA2DS2‑VASc for thromboembolic risk, and serial biomarker assessments can refine prognosis and guide follow‑up intensity in AF [^113aYKoD] [^116Qf7CG]. But wait, I should confirm that biomarker‑guided therapy is still investigational for AF outcomes beyond anticoagulation; current evidence supports prognostic use and risk refinement rather than prescriptive therapeutic algorithms at this time [^1111V6MX].

> In summary, yes — AF can cause troponin elevation, most often via rate‑related supply–demand mismatch, atrial myocyte injury during remodeling, and neurohormonal activation, rather than classic plaque rupture; high‑sensitivity assays increase detection but reduce specificity, so interpretation must rely on clinical context, serial troponin kinetics, ECG timing, and selective imaging or angiography to distinguish type 1 MI from AF‑related myocardial injury, while recognizing that any troponin elevation in AF carries adverse prognostic information and warrants careful evaluation and risk‑directed management [^117GMN3p] [^114ztLHD] [^111y6ZES] [^116iTKxW].

---

Yes, atrial fibrillation (AF) can cause **troponin elevation** [^117GMN3p], most often due to **supply–demand mismatch** from rapid ventricular rates or underlying coronary disease, rather than primary coronary occlusion [^113dW5n8]. Troponin elevation in AF is common with high-sensitivity assays [^114ztLHD] and is usually mild; **marked elevations (> 10× ULN) are uncommon** and should prompt evaluation for acute coronary syndromes or other causes [^111MW5gU]. AF-related troponin release is linked to **worse outcomes**, including higher mortality and adverse cardiovascular events, and should be interpreted in clinical context with serial measurements and imaging as needed [^111MW5gU] [^1127nEJr].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of troponin elevation in AF

Several mechanisms can explain **troponin elevation** in AF:

- **Supply–demand mismatch**: Rapid ventricular rates increase myocardial oxygen demand while reducing coronary perfusion time, causing ischemia without coronary occlusion (type 2 MI) [^117GMN3p].

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: AF often coexists with CAD; plaque rupture or erosion can cause type 1 MI with troponin release [^114ssMM7].

- **Atrial myocyte injury**: AF-related atrial stretch, fibrosis, and inflammation may cause atrial myocyte injury and troponin release [^116GwwoH].

- **Neurohormonal activation**: Sympathetic surge and RAAS activation in AF can increase myocardial stress and troponin release [^11769HHQ].

---

## Frequency and magnitude of troponin elevation in AF

Troponin elevation is common in AF, especially with high-sensitivity assays [^114ztLHD]. In the ARISTOTLE trial, hs-troponin I was detected in 98.5% of AF patients, with 9.2% above the 99th percentile; **most elevations were mild** [^114ztLHD]. Marked elevations (> 10× ULN) are uncommon and should prompt evaluation for ACS or other causes [^117GMN3p].

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic implications

Troponin elevation in AF is **clinically significant** and associated with worse outcomes:

- **Mortality**: Elevated troponin independently predicts higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in AF [^111MW5gU] [^113HPbQz].

- **Adverse cardiovascular events**: Troponin elevation correlates with higher rates of stroke, MI, heart failure, and recurrent AF [^114ztLHD] [^1144tX3Q].

- **Risk stratification**: Troponin improves risk prediction beyond clinical scores (e.g. CHA2DS2-VASc) and is incorporated into biomarker-based risk tools (e.g. ABC stroke score) [^113aYKoD] [^114ztLHD].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and differentiation

Differentiating AF-related troponin elevation from ACS is challenging; **serial troponin measurements** and clinical context are essential [^117GMN3p]. AF-related elevations are often mild and stable, whereas ACS typically shows a dynamic rise/fall pattern [^111y6ZES]. Additional evaluation with ECG, echocardiography, and coronary angiography may be needed when ACS is suspected [^117GMN3p].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **clinical context** when interpreting troponin in AF:

- **Serial measurements**: Use serial troponin to assess dynamics and guide diagnosis [^117GMN3p].

- **Integrated approach**: Combine troponin with clinical presentation, ECG, and imaging to differentiate myocardial injury from ACS [^117GMN3p].

- **Risk stratification**: Consider troponin for risk assessment and management decisions in AF [^1111V6MX].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Management of troponin elevation in AF focuses on addressing underlying causes and optimizing care:

- **Rate control**: Aggressive rate control can reduce myocardial oxygen demand and troponin levels [^113ViaFq].

- **Anticoagulation**: Appropriate anticoagulation reduces thromboembolic risk associated with troponin elevation [^notfound].

- **Coronary evaluation**: Consider coronary angiography or noninvasive testing when ACS is suspected, especially with marked troponin elevation [^111MW5gU].

- **Risk stratification**: Use troponin to guide risk assessment and tailor therapy intensity [^113aYKoD].

---

AF can cause **troponin elevation**, typically via supply–demand mismatch or atrial injury, and is associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation should be contextual, using serial measurements and adjunctive testing to distinguish AF-related injury from ACS and guide management.

Future Directions

The new high‐sensitivity troponin assays may allow clinicians to better stratify risk in other potentially high‐risk populations. However, the utility of troponin testing in these settings is unclear and awaits further investigation. A recent example is atrial fibrillation, which represents an important population of patients with few, if any, useful biomarkers currently available to aid clinical risk stratification. Traditionally, clinical risk scores are used to estimate risk for thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation; then, anticoagulant medication is considered depending on embolic risk and bleeding risk, medication adherence, etc. Roldan et alfound that in a large cohort of chronic atrial fibrillation patients on oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, high‐sensitivity troponin levels were independently associated with an increased risk for thrombotic and vascular events as well as cardiovascular death. This relationship was maintained even after CHADS 2 (which estimates risk based on the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) risk factors and HAS‐BLED (defined as hemorrhage involving a critical anatomic site, for example, intracranial, or a bleed requiring hospitalization, transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed cells, or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/L) risk factors were added to the model.

In addition, there are few clinical tools to identify which patients will have recurrent atrial fibrillation. A prospective cohort substudy of GISSI AF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico–Atrial Fibrillation), a trial to determine the effects of valsartan on recurrence of atrial fibrillation, studied the utility of several biomarkers to predict recurrent of AF. Over 2‐year follow‐up, high‐sensitivity troponin was independently associated with the recurrence of AF, as were 2 other biomarkers. While high‐sensitivity troponin may add to prognostic information and elevated troponin levels may warrant increased surveillance of high‐risk patients, it remains uncertain whether any therapies might be triggered by this type of risk stratification (eg, prolonged antiarrhythmic medications, atrial fibrillation ablation, or atrial occluder devices).

### Prognostic significance of troponin level in 3121 patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (the NIHR health informatics collaborative TROP-AF study) [^111MW5gU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Abnormally elevated troponin at any level is associated with increased risk of mortality in patients presenting with AF, and higher troponin levels confer worse prognosis. Coronary angiography is rarely performed unless AF is associated with large troponin increases, but when it is performed, it is associated with lower mortality. This raises the question of whether the prognostic significance of troponin could be mediated by CAD and may be responsive to revascularization. Clinical trials are warranted to clarify the role of investigating and treating CAD in patients presenting with AF with elevated troponin levels.

### Minor elevations in troponin I are associated with mortality and adverse cardiac events in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116ojGFw]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

In patients with atrial fibrillation, minor troponin I elevation is regularly detected; however, the prognostic significance of this finding is unknown. We therefore sought to examine the prognostic value of elevated troponin I in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods and Results

A prospective study was conducted analysing all consecutive patients admitted with atrial fibrillation in a 2-year period. Patients with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) were excluded. Minor troponin elevation was defined as a troponin I level between 0.15 and 0.65 ng/mL, which is still below the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit. A positive troponin I was defined as ≥ 0.65 ng/mL. Study outcomes were all-cause mortality (death), death and myocardial infarction (death/MI), or all major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, MI, or revascularization). A total of 407 patients were eligible for inclusion. The median duration of follow-up was 688 days. A minor elevation occurred in 81 (20%) patients and 77 (19%) had a positive troponin I. In a multivariate model, minor troponin I elevation and a positive troponin I were independently associated with death [hazard ratio (HR): 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17–4.73 for minor elevation and HR: 3.77, 95% CI: 1.42–10.02 for positive troponin I]. Also, there was an independent correlation between the combined endpoints of death/MI and MACE and both a minor elevation and a positive troponin I.

Conclusion

Minor elevations in troponin I on hospital admission are associated with mortality and cardiac events in patients with atrial fibrillation and might be useful for risk stratification.

### Clinical utility and prognostic significance of measuring troponin I levels in patients presenting to the emergency room with atrial fibrillation [^111aZ1Ax]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of mildly elevated troponins in patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not well understood.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that mildly elevated troponin in these patients is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods

In a multi-center, retrospective study, 662 patients with AF were divided into 3 groups based on troponin levels: group 1, mildly elevated; group 2, normal; and group 3, troponin not measured. Primary outcome was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) at one year.

Results

Levels of TnI were measured in 503 (76%) patients. They were elevated in 220 patients (33%, group 1; mean, 0.56 ng/mL), normal in 283 patients (43%, group 2), and not measured in 159 patients (24%, group 3). Significantly more cardiac testing was done at index hospitalization in group 1 (50%) compared with groups 2 and 3 (28% and 29%, P ≤ 0.001) and in the following year (29%, vs 20% and 17%, P = 0.02). Group 1 had more positive tests (62%) compared with groups 2 and 3 (25% and 43%, P ≤ 0.001). Group 1 had a significantly higher occurrence of the primary endpoint (22%, vs 10% and 15%, P = 0.002), driven primarily by a higher incidence of MI in group 1 (7%, vs 1% and 2%, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Troponin levels are routinely checked in a majority of patients presenting to the emergency department with AF. Even mildly elevated TnI is associated with a greater incidence of coronary artery disease on diagnostic testing and a higher 1-year incidence of MI.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^114ssMM7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest pain is one of the most common causes of admission to an emergency department. Introduction of newer, more sensitive troponin assays has proven to facilitate early diagnosis of an acute spontaneous myocardial infarction. This improved discrimination relies mainly on the superior sensitivity of these assays; however, the downside is their reduced specificity such that there are a significant number of individuals with elevated troponin levels and symptoms indicative of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in whom no coronary cause can be identified.

In addition to the classical cascade of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation followed by necrosis of dependent myocardium, other causes of myocardial infarction (MI), such as myocardial injury due to an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand, have been defined. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction used worldwide, which has recently been updated, the acute spontaneous MI is denoted MI type 1, whereas myocardial injury secondary to an ischemic imbalance is denoted MI type 2.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the general population, and due to changing demographics, the number of patients with AF is continuously increasing. A large proportion of AF patients will be hospitalized during their lifetime and many of these patients will be admitted to emergency departments for cardiac troponin testing. Different mechanisms have been proposed to lead to troponin elevation in individuals with AF. With the availability of newer, more sensitive cardiac troponin assays, many of these AF patients will have elevated troponin levels without actually suffering an acute spontaneous type 1 MI. Additionally, AF often accompanies and complicates acute MI.

The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical performance of a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay in diagnosing type 1 MI in patients presenting with AF and clinical symptoms suggestive of an ACS in two large, distinct study cohorts. An additional objective was to define and validate an optimal diagnostic troponin I threshold in such a setting. Precise identification is of utmost importance in these individuals, as patients at risk with type 1 MI benefit from an early and aggressive MI-specific treatment compared with individuals suffering a type 2 MI due to AF in whom a treatment targeting coronary alterations does not seem constructive.

### Association of heart rate with troponin levels among patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation [^113bAxhs]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponins are routinely used to rule in or rule out acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department (ED). Among patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), mildly elevated troponin levels are common but rarely caused by type 1 myocardial infarction. We aimed to investigate the association of heart rate with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTn T) levels in patients admitted to the ED for AF.

---

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^112W1ABT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

### Clinical applications of biomarkers in atrial fibrillation [^1111V6MX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

While biomarkers have greatly impacted the diagnosis and management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the use of biomarkers has been slow to permeate management of atrial fibrillation. Guideline recommendations on the use of biomarkers in atrial fibrillation were virtually nonexistent until the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on atrial fibrillation offered a class IIb recommendation to consider using biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptide to further refine stroke and bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients. Biomarker levels have been associated with incident atrial fibrillation, postoperative atrial fibrillation, acute atrial fibrillation, diagnosis of myocardial infarction and heart failure in atrial fibrillation, and prognosis in atrial fibrillation. This review will offer an in-depth survey of current evidence on the use of biomarkers in atrial fibrillation and propose clinical algorithms to aid the internist in using biomarkers in atrial fibrillation management.

### Improved rate control reduces cardiac troponin T levels in permanent atrial fibrillation [^113ViaFq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Detectable levels of troponins are often found in serum of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and recent reports suggest that Tn concentrations are independently related to patient prognosis.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that treatment with common rate-reducing drugs might lower the levels of cardiac troponin T (TnT) in patients with permanent AF. We also wanted to investigate whether the different drugs would impact the Tn levels differently.

Methods

Sixty patients were included (mean age 71 ± 9 years, 18 women) in this randomized crossover study. All patients had stable, permanent AF without ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure. Diltiazem 360 mg, verapamil 240 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, and carvedilol 25 mg were administered once daily for 3 weeks, in a randomized sequence. At baseline and on the last day of each treatment period, TnT concentrations were measured at rest and after a maximal exercise test.

Results

TnT was detectable in all patients. In 22% of the patients, TnT concentrations were above the threshold normally used for diagnosing myocardial infarction. All drugs reduced the levels of TnT significantly compared with baseline (P < 0.001 for all), but there were no significant differences between the treatments. Levels of TnT increased significantly in response to exercise testing (P < 0.001 for all).

Conclusions

Elevated TnT was demonstrated in a large proportion of stable patients with permanent AF without ischemic heart disease. A moderate reduction of heart rate by the study drugs was associated with a significant reduction in levels of TnT.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^114ZxR63]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The availability of robust, sensitive cardiac troponin assays has been shown to substantially improve the timely diagnostic workup as well as outcome in patients with suspected MI. This amelioration is mainly driven by the superior assay sensitivity, which is accompanied by a loss in specificity. Several disease entities other than type 1 MI have been described to be associated with elevated cardiac troponin levels. This includes patients presenting to an emergency department with a primary diagnosis of AF in whom troponin I has been shown to have only a moderate positive predictive value regarding an underlying relevant coronary obstruction when using standard troponin cut-offs. Considering that a relevant proportion of patients presenting with AF also complain of chest pain and/or dyspnea and that AF often accompanies and complicates acute MI, data concerning diagnostic troponin use in patients with chronic AF and suspected type 1 MI are urgently needed.

### High-sensitivity troponin I for risk assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial [^114ztLHD]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity troponin-I (hs-TnI) measurement improves risk assessment for cardiovascular events in many clinical settings, but the added value in atrial fibrillation patients has not been described.

Methods and Results

At randomization, hs-TnI was analyzed in 14 821 atrial fibrillation patients in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial comparing apixaban with warfarin. The associations between hs-TnI concentrations and clinical outcomes were evaluated by using adjusted Cox analysis. The hs-TnI assay detected troponin (≥ 1.3 ng/L) in 98.5% patients, 50% had levels > 5.4, 25% had levels > 10.1, and 9.2% had levels ≥ 23 ng/L (the 99th percentile in healthy individuals). During a median of 1.9 years follow-up, annual rates of stroke or systemic embolism ranged from 0.76% in the lowest hs-TnI quartile to 2.26% in the highest quartile (> 10.1 ng/L). In multivariable analysis, hs-TnI was significantly associated with stroke or systemic embolism, adjusted hazard ratio 1.98 (1.42–2.78), P = 0.0007. hs-TnI was also significantly associated with cardiac death; annual rates ranged from 0.40% to 4.24%, hazard ratio 4.52 (3.05–6.70), P < 0.0001, in the corresponding groups, and for major bleeding hazard ratio 1.44 (1.11–1.86), P = 0.0250. Adding hs-TnI levels to the CHA2DS2VASc score improved c-statistics from 0.629 to 0.653 for stroke or systemic embolism, and from 0.591 to 0.731 for cardiac death. There were no significant interactions with study treatment.

Conclusions

Troponin-I is detected in 98.5% and elevated in 9.2% of atrial fibrillation patients. The hs-TnI level is independently associated with a raised risk of stroke, cardiac death, and major bleeding and improves risk stratification beyond the CHA2DS2VASc score. The benefits of apixaban in comparison with warfarin are consistent regardless of hs-TnI levels.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^114GSigG]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) direct-current cardioversion — biomarker and electrocardiographic changes: Transient ST-segment elevation may appear on the electrocardiogram after cardioversion, and in a study of 72 cardioversion attempts with average energy over 400 J (range 50 to 1280 J), serum troponin-T and troponin-I levels did not rise significantly; microscopic myocardial damage related to direct-current cardioversion has not been confirmed and is probably clinically insignificant.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^111c5Da8]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Assessing troponin elevations in sick patients can also be complicated because chronic, low-level elevations in troponin have been documented in stable patients with renal failure, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diabetes mellitus, and the list of causes of elevated troponin appears to be growing. These diagnoses are common in intensive care units, and it is clear that a single elevated troponin requires a comparison to baseline, with follow-up to determine its relative stability.

Multiple advantages of using the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI are evident, but are the diagnostic criteria optimal? TYPE 2 MI fits as a diagnosis for our example patient because the troponin elevation was felt to be due to the episode of hypoxia and hypotension, rather than a new plaque rupture/erosion/dissection/ or fissuring (TYPE 1 MI). Unfortunately, TYPE 2 is not specific to non-coronary myocardial injury, because it also includes MI caused by coronary spasm or embolism. Although not related to atherosclerotic plaque, both spasm and embolism are coronary events and have more in common with a ruptured plaque than with myocardial injury induced by hypoxia, hypotension, myocarditis, etc. It would appear of primary importance to differentiate a new coronary event from a non-coronary source of myocardial damage, especially when assessing the need for urgent therapy or intervention. In our case, for example, the atrial fibrillation provides a potential source of emboli. If a new coronary occlusion is strongly suspected, it would be quite difficult to know whether it is thrombotic or embolic in origin, even by coronary angiography. The indications for anticoagulation and/or invasive intervention would likely be similar in either case, but not necessarily so if hypotension and hypoxia were the culprit.

The non-descriptive nature of the term TYPE 2 MI is also of concern. Biomarker release from the heart in the absence of a new coronary event has been recognized for some time. The ACC/AHA guidelines for management of unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MI used 'secondary UA' to describe enzyme elevation precipitated by a condition extrinsic to the coronary arterial bed. Since angina may not be present, this appears to be a less desirable alternative. 'Non-specific troponin elevation' and 'non-thrombotic troponin elevation'as well as 'troponin leak' have also been used. The terms 'concomitant myocardial injury' and 'troponin positive non-ACS' are additional possibilities. We would prefer the term 'secondary myocardial injury' because there is usually an obvious illness or acute event related to the cardiac injury.

### Prognostic significance of troponin level in 3121 patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (the NIHR health informatics collaborative TROP-AF study) [^115DjX55]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients presenting to the hospital with atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent tachyarrhythmia, 1 often undergo measurement of cardiac biomarkers. 2, 3 In particular, troponin levels are measured, ostensibly, to diagnose an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) manifesting as AF. 4 However, interpretation of the result is hampered by uncertainty over the clinical importance of troponin levels in AF. The diagnostic and prognostic utility of troponin in ACS, 5 and other cardiac presentations, such as heart failure, 6 is firmly established. However, these predictive relationships may not be observed in AF, where troponin release may be related to rapid ventricular response and the mechanical effects of fibrillation on the atria rather than coronary artery disease (CAD). Observational analysis of patients presenting with AF have identified associations between troponin level and clinically important outcomes, but these studies did not assess mortality. In clinical practice, small troponin increases in AF presentations are typically ignored and do not routinely prompt investigation for CAD.

The aims of our study were to explore the relationship between troponin level and mortality in patients presenting to the hospital with AF, to understand the pattern of referral for coronary angiography in relation to troponin level, and to determine the role of coronary angiography in the relationship between troponin and mortality in these patients.

Mechanisms of Troponin Release in AF

Troponin I and T bind to tropomyosin in the intracellular sarcomeric contraction complex, but they are also found in the cytosol. 11 In ACS, obstruction of epicardial coronary arteries results in myocyte necrosis, releasing troponin into the circulation, with larger infarcts both releasing more troponin and risking worse and more likely clinical sequelae, including death. 5 The explanation for the relationship between troponin and mortality in ACS is, thus, clear, but troponin increases carry prognostic significance in several settings, such as heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. 6 The cause of circulating troponin in AF is particularly disputed, however, which is one reason for the relatively low importance clinicians place on troponin leak in AF. 11 Type II myocardial infarction caused by ventricular myocyte death during rapidly conducted AF in the context of preexisting CAD is a putative mechanism. Although it is likely that this often plays a key role, as rate control can reduce troponin leak, 12 troponin release also occurs at normal ventricular rates. Furthermore, CAD identified is not always severe or physiologically significant, which makes treatment decisions, particularly the role of revascularization, uncertain. Although it is not known whether atrial myocytes themselves release troponin during fibrillation (regardless of ventricular rate), there is a large body of evidence for atrial scarring in AF, 12 suggesting this may be the case. However, acute atrial necrosis may only be the mechanism for new‐onset AF as opposed to the first presentation of chronic AF. Patients with AF experience troponin increases in the short‐term phase of stroke, 13 implicating sympathetic activation as a cause for troponin release and a marker of mortality risk. AF as a manifestation of acute type I myocardial infarction, where there is spontaneous thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries, is thought to occur rarely. This may be more common than diagnosed and would be another explanation of the link between troponin and mortality.

We cannot directly infer, from our analysis, a mechanism for troponin release nor the mechanism via which troponin increases are associated with worse prognosis, but our findings raise the possibility that the clinical importance of troponin release in AF may mediated by CAD.

Relationship With Existing Evidence

This is the largest study to assess the relationship between troponin and mortality in patients presenting to the hospital with AF. Other studies have assessed the effects on revascularization, stroke, cardiovascular death, and other clinically important outcomes. However, all such diagnoses, including fatal stroke and cardiovascular death, risk inaccuracy and bias to varying extents. All‐cause mortality is the only outcome where the diagnosis is free from such bias. Larger subanalyses of randomized controlled trials comparing direct oral anticoagulants with warfarin have assessed the relationship between troponin and mortality in patients with AF 3, 8 and found a significant correlation. However, this is an entirely different population of patients with a background of AF, rather than patients presenting to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of AF. In stable patients diagnosed with AF previously, increased troponin will inevitably be predictive of poor prognosis but troponin screening for patients in a stable phase of AF is rare and not a clinically relevant problem. How to interpret troponin increases in short‐term presentations with AF is an extremely common clinical dilemma, which is addressed in this study.

Conti et al prospectively enrolled 3627 patients presenting with recent‐onset (< 48‐hours) AF, but excluded patients with ACS, clinical instability, or severe comorbidity, 4 and offered coronary angiography if the troponin level was elevated above the ULN. Troponin elevation (above the ULN) was associated with angiographic CAD, revascularization, and increased likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events, but mortality was not measured, and troponin was dichotomized at the ULN. We have shown that higher troponin levels are associated with a higher mortality risk, indicating that the magnitude of troponin increase as a continuous variable is important for decision making. Supporting our findings, Alghamry et al demonstrated, in a retrospective study of 200 patients, that troponin dichotomized at the ULN had poor ability to predict CAD, whereas peak troponin, analyzed continuously, did predict CAD. 9 We did not find an association between higher levels of troponin below the ULN and increased mortality, despite a large number of patients analyzed at a long follow‐up duration. A smaller study (n = 330) suggested detectable troponin level below the ULN does predict mortality, but this may have been a chance finding as our study population for this group of patients was 4 times larger and found no association. 10

### Prognostic significance of troponin level in 3121 patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (the NIHR health informatics collaborative TROP-AF study) [^114BmM9V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting with atrial fibrillation often undergo a blood test to measure troponin, but interpretation of the result is impeded by uncertainty about its clinical importance. We investigated the relationship between troponin level, coronary angiography, and all‐cause mortality in real‐world patients presenting with.

Methods and Results

We used National Institute of Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative data to identify patients admitted between 2010 and 2017 at 5 tertiary centers in the United Kingdom with a primary diagnosis of. Peak troponin results were scaled as multiples of the upper limit of normal. A total of 3121 patients were included in the analysis. Over a median follow‐up of 1462 (interquartile range, 929–1975) days, there were 586 deaths (18.8%). The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality associated with a positive troponin (value above upper limit of normal) was 1.20 (95%, 1.01–1.43; P < 0.05). Higher troponin levels were associated with higher risk of mortality, reaching a maximum hazard ratio of 2.6 (95%, 1.9–3.4) at ≈250 multiples of the upper limit of normal. There was an exponential relationship between higher troponin levels and increased odds of coronary angiography. The mortality risk was 36% lower in patients undergoing coronary angiography than in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61; 95%, 0.42–0.89; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Increased troponin was associated with increased risk of mortality in patients presenting with. The lower hazard ratio in patients undergoing invasive management raises the possibility that the clinical importance of troponin release inmay be mediated by coronary artery disease, which may be responsive to revascularization.

### Usefulness of high-sensitivity troponin I to predict outcome in patients with newly detected atrial fibrillation [^1144tX3Q]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The prognostic role of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) in patients with newly detected atrial fibrillation (AF) is not well established. We investigate the association of elevated hs-TnI with clinical outcomes and explore the utility of hs-TnI for risk assessment in patients with newly detected AF. From August 2014 to December 2016, 2,361 consecutive patients with newly detected AF were enrolled in a retrospective, single-center registry. Of these, 957 patients were selected and classified into 4 groups according to hs-TnI quartiles. The primary outcome was all-cause death during follow-up. The hs-TnI level was 3.6 ng/L or less in the lowest quartile (Q1), more than 3.6 ng/L to 10.1 ng/L or less in the second quartile (Q2), more than 10.1 ng/L to 22.0 ng/L or less in the third quartile (Q3), and more than 22.0 ng/L in the highest quartile (Q4). The median follow-up period was 19.3 months. In multivariable Cox regression model, Q4 has a higher risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 3.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 10.00; p = 0.02), readmission for heart failure (adjusted HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.01–3.05; p = 0.04), and readmission for revascularization (adjusted HR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.25 to 12.17; p = 0.02) compared with Q1. Independent predictors of all-cause death were renal insufficiency (adjusted HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.53; p = 0.02), highest hs-TnI quartile (adjusted HR: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.18 to 9.27; p = 0.02) and anticoagulation therapy (adjusted HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.93; p = 0.03). Elevated hs-TnI is independently associated with higher mortality in patients with AF and serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker in patients with newly detected AF.

### Prognostic significance of troponin level in 3121 patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (the NIHR health informatics collaborative TROP-AF study) [^116iTKxW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study investigating the relationship between troponin level, coronary angiography, and mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of AF. This is also the largest study to report the association between troponin level and all‐cause mortality in this group.

Abnormal Troponin Levels Predict Mortality in AF

In 3121 patients presenting with AF, whose troponin was measured, there was a significant association between troponin levels (above the ULN) and higher mortality, even after adjusting for key demographic and clinical factors. Associations derived from dichotomizing continuous variables, such as troponin, can be driven by extreme values. However, even low‐level troponin elevations above the normal range (1–10 xULN) were associated with higher mortality risk. Abnormal troponin levels, at any level, appear to have prognostic importance in AF; and higher troponin levels appear to confer worse prognosis.

Nonlinear Relationship Between Troponin and Mortality

The relationship between troponin level and adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in patients presenting with AF is nonlinear when considering the entire spectrum of troponin values, including detectable troponin within the normal range. Below the ULN of troponin, there does not appear to be any relationship between higher troponin levels and increased hazard ratio for mortality. A similar nonlinear pattern between troponin level and mortality has previously been observed in an unselected group of patients without ACS. 7 Specifically, in our AF cohort, above the ULN there is a direct relationship between troponin level and mortality, reaching a hazard ratio of ≈2.6 at 263 xULN. The inflection near ULN may represent a genuine cutoff in the importance of troponin and supports the use of the 99th percentile in determining the "normal" range. Although this does not mean all patients presenting with AF should undergo invasive investigation, it does suggest that the troponin threshold for investigating for CAD may be lower than current practice.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^111PRhJv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The use of troponin I assayed upon admission and after 3 hours to obtain data on troponin kinetics provides valid diagnostic information in patients with suspected acute spontaneous myocardial infarction and chronic atrial fibrillation. Considering the higher troponin I levels observed in patients with atrial fibrillation, application of diagnostic cut-offs other than the 99th percentile might be beneficial.

Limitations

Although this study benefits from having been conducted using real‐world clinical data in a large number of patients from multiple centers, there are some limitations. This study was retrospective, with data extracted from electronic medical records and subject to the limitations of this approach, including difficulty in accounting for all potential confounding factors. Bias may be introduced because of inaccuracies in routine data collection. In routine clinical practice, patients with larger troponin increases are more likely to be given a primary diagnosis of ACS on discharge, even if their presentation was with AF, altering the overall risk status of the patients with AF as the primary diagnosis. The data set also includes only those patients who had a troponin measurement potentially altering the overall risk profile. Furthermore, the subtype of AF (paroxysmal or new onset) was not recorded, preventing analysis by chronicity of AF, and the role of stress testing was not available in the data set.

We could not directly infer mechanisms for the importance of troponin increases in AF. Routinely collected data from electronic health records lack resolution for fine details of clinical encounters. For this reason, we could not analyze the data for the effect of troponin on cardiovascular outcomes and compare this with all‐cause mortality. However, as previously discussed, all‐cause mortality is the only outcome to be free from bias, which is of particular relevance in observational analyses.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^1152NCps]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of modern troponin assays has facilitated diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction due to improved sensitivity with corresponding loss of specificity. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with elevated levels of troponin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of troponin I in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and chronic AF.

Methods

Contemporary sensitive troponin I was assayed in a derivation cohort of 90 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and chronic AF to establish diagnostic cut-offs. These thresholds were validated in an independent cohort of 314 patients with suspected myocardial infarction and AF upon presentation. Additionally, changes in troponin I concentration within 3 hours were used.

Results

In the derivation cohort, optimized thresholds with respect to a rule-out strategy with high sensitivity and a rule-in strategy with high specificity were established. In the validation cohort, application of the rule-out cut-off led to a negative predictive value of 97%. The rule-in cut-off was associated with a positive predictive value of 88% compared with 71% if using the 99th percentile cut-off. In patients with troponin I levels above the specificity-optimized threshold, additional use of the 3-hour change in absolute/relative concentration resulted in a further improved positive predictive value of 96%/100%.

Conclusions

Troponin I concentration and the 3-hour change in its concentration provide valid diagnostic information in patients with suspected myocardial infarction and chronic AF. With regard to AF-associated elevation of troponin levels, application of diagnostic cut-offs other than the 99th percentile might be beneficial.

### Harmonized outcome measures for use in atrial fibrillation patient registries and clinical practice: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society board of trustees [^114Rmgwb]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation outcome definitions — myocardial infarction (MI) — specify that the term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia, and that under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI: detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least one of the following, symptoms of ischemia or new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB); myocardial infarction in the context of surgical ablation is defined separately.

### Importance of persistent elevation of cardiac biomarkers in atrial fibrillation: a RE-LY substudy [^116Qf7CG]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the prognostic importance of transient or persistent elevations of cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) and N-terminal-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Plasma samples were obtained at randomisation and after 3 months in 2514 patients with AF in the RE-LY trial; median follow-up was 2.0 years. Patients were grouped based on levels at the two time points according to detectable cTnI levels (≥ 0.01 µg/L) or NT-proBNP levels above median (≥ 778 ng/L). These groups were related to occurrence of stroke or cardiovascular events evaluated with Cox models adjusting for established risk factors.

Results

The proportion of patients with detectable cTnI levels at both time points was 48.5%, at one time point 28.5% and at neither time point 21.0%. Patients with detectable cTnI at both time points had substantially higher rates of stroke compared with those with transient elevations and those with no elevation at either time point (p < 0.005, effect of cTnI). Persistent elevation of either or both cardiac biomarkers at baseline and 3 months was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events and mortality (p < 0.0001). Prognostic prediction improved most with the use of repeated measurements of both cardiac biomarkers simultaneously (p < 0.05) and achieved C-statistic 0.644 for stroke compared with 0.611 for CHADS2-score.

Conclusions

Persistent elevation of troponin and NT-proBNP indicates a worse prognosis than transient elevations or no elevations of either marker. Prognostication of stroke, death and thromboembolic events is improved by the use of repeated determinations of cardiac biomarkers.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^115sGW19]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic cardiac arrhythmia in adults, with an estimated prevalence of 2.7 million adults in the United States. In 2030, the prevalence is estimated to rise to 12.1 million. AF is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and can lead to severe complications, such as stroke, heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Generally, AF is paroxysmal and occurs asymptomatically, which creates obstacles for the detection of AF. Due to this limitation, investigators have developed and validated risk prediction models for AF, which can assist in identifying high‐risk individuals. Addition of novel or repeated and high‐sensitivity risk factor measurements have the potential to enhance the predictive ability of these models.

High sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) is a well‐established biomarker of myocardial injury, which is used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction (MI). A growing body of evidence suggests that MI is associated with AF as preceding or complicating the clinical course of AF. Prior studies have reported associations between hs‐cTnT and the risk of developing AF, supporting the role of circulating hs‐cTnT as a biomarker of AF risk. In a Japanese general population without apparent cardiovascular disease, circulating hs‐cTnT levels were greater among subjects with AF compared to those without AF. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the risk of incident AF was 1.16 times higher with 1‐standard deviation increase of ln(hs‐cTnT) level. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a large prospective cohort of ambulatory older adults, hs‐cTnT was significantly associated with incident AF beyond traditional risk factors. Elevated hs‐cTnT levels are also associated with incidence of other cardiovascular and chronic diseases, such as incident HF and CKD, which have similar risk factors and often coexist with AF.

### Serial measures of cardiac troponin T levels by a highly sensitive assay and incident atrial fibrillation in a prospective cohort of ambulatory older adults [^114eZsAM]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Various mechanisms in cardiac remodeling related to atrial fibrillation (AF) lead to elevated circulating cardiac troponin levels, but little is known about such elevations upstream to AF onset.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to study the association between circulating troponin levels as assessed by a highly sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay and incident atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

In a large prospective cohort of ambulatory older adults [the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)], hs-cTnT levels were measured in sera that were collected at enrollment from 4262 participants without AF (2871 with follow-up measurements). Incident AF was identified by electrocardiograms during CHS visits, hospital discharge diagnoses, and Medicare files, including outpatient and physician claims diagnoses.

Results

Over median follow-up of 11.2 years (interquartile range 6.1–16.5), 1363 participants (32.0%) developed AF. Higher baseline levels of hs-cTnT were associated with incident AF in covariate-adjusted analyses accounting for demographics, traditional risk factors, and incident heart failure in time-dependent analyzes (hazard ratio for 3rd tertile vs undetectable 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.48–2.08). This association was statistically significant in analyses that additionally adjusted for biomarkers of inflammation and hemodynamic strain (hazard ratio for 3rd tertile vs undetectable 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.16–1.65). Significant associations were also found when hs-cTnT levels were treated as a continuous variable and when examining change from baseline of hs-cTnT levels and incident AF.

Conclusion

The findings show a significant association of circulating troponin levels in ambulatory older adults with incident AF beyond that of traditional risk factors, incident heart failure, and biomarkers of inflammation and hemodynamic strain.

### Cardiac biomarkers predict mortality in emergency patients presenting with atrial fibrillation [^113grWr8]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological considerations

Cardiac troponins have been primarily introduced as sensitive biomarkers for the inclusion and exclusion of acute myocardial infarction; however, it has been previously shown that elevation of cardiac troponins might also indicate the severity of other non-cardiac-related conditions; as symptomatic AF is an abnormal physiological state, elevated levels of troponins might reflect an oxygen demand/delivery mismatch and changes in microvascular blood flow thus indicating the urgency or emergency of disease. This hypothesis might further be strengthened by the fact that BNPs are mainly released in response to high wall tension during states of haemodynamic stress.

Clinical implications

EDs play a key role in the management of the inhomogeneous group of patients with AF; the use of risk stratification tools is mandatory for a time-effective and cost-effective treatment and easily accessible biomarkers might assist in this goal-oriented and risk-oriented approach. As to our observations, NT-proBNP and hs-TnT may serve as those ideal biomarkers for identification of patients with symptomatic AF at risk; due to the increased risk of all-cause mortality, an extensive screening and more aggressive treatment stratified should be considered in all patients with AF with elevated NT-proBNP or/and hs-TnT levels presenting to an ED.

Strengths and limitations

The present study inherits all known limitations of a prospective observational study design that have to be acknowledged; those limitations are not limited to individual patient profiles, management at the ED and in further care only. However, this study covers a large cohort of consecutive patients within a limited and short time frame that decreases the potential negative impact on our conclusions. Due to the nature of an ED setting, only 1780 of a total 2574 episodes were available for analysis as to missing biomarker data; however, baseline characteristics between those included and excluded showed no significant differences lowering the potential impact of this limitation (table 4). Besides the clear demonstration of a biological gradient between biomarker levels and mid-term mortality, the probably greatest strength of our study is all-cause mortality being the primary outcome measure; as the issuance of death certificates is mandatory in Austria and registered by a central, state-controlled office, information bias can be nearly excluded. Due to our single-centre design, however, our results will not be fully generalisable to other settings and populations; our results ideally need confirmation in larger populations and this might allow then to estimate conceivable cut-off values for risk estimation and stratification that we were not able to due to sample size limitations.

### Abnormal troponin level as short-term predictor of poor outcome in acute atrial fibrillation [^111bLXGq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The link between minor troponin (cardiac troponin I [cTnI]) elevations and atrial fibrillation (AF) is still debated.

Methods

A total of 948 patients with AF lasting less than 48 hours participated in the study and were required to undergo 1-month and 12-month follow-up. The exclusion criteria were represented by younger than 18 years, the presence of hemodynamic instability, or severe comorbidity. Primary end point was the composite of ischemic vascular events inclusive of stroke, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization, and death.

Results

In the short term, 4 patients (5%) of 78 with abnormal cTnI reached the primary end point (P = .001 vs others). Conversely, in the long term, 13 patients (17%) with abnormal cTnI, 21 (10%) with known ischemic vascular disease, and 50 (5%) aged patients (75 ± 10 years) reached the primary end point (P < .001, P < .001, and P = .002, respectively). At multivariate analysis, abnormal cTnI (hazard ratio [HR], 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.84; p = 0.005), known ischemic vascular disease (HR, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–3.70; p = 0.021), and age (HR, 1.05; 95 confidence interval, 1.02–1.08; p = 0.002) were predictors of the primary end point. Minimal or minor cTnI elevation (< 0.45 or ≥ 0.45 ng/mL, respectively) showed no differences when associated with the primary end point. The C-statistic demonstrated the significant prognostic value of older age and known ischemic vascular disease, beyond troponin. Clinical parameters inclusive of heart rate, blood pressure, and risk factors for arteriosclerosis showed no relationship with adverse events. Readmission rate did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

In patients with acute AF, minor cTnI elevations link to short-term adverse events. Known ischemic vascular disease and older age showed prognostic value only in the long term.

### Harmonized outcome measures for use in atrial fibrillation patient registries and clinical practice: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society board of trustees [^117GeLJU]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Outcome measures for atrial fibrillation registries — myocardial infarction definitions: Myocardial infarction (MI) can be identified by development of pathological Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy, and includes cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) before biomarkers could be obtained or rise. Procedural criteria are specified: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–related MI requires elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) values (> 5 × 99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values > 20% if baseline values are elevated and stable or falling, plus one of the following — symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication, or imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Stent thrombosis causes MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy with myocardial ischaemia and a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)–related MI requires elevation of cardiac biomarker values (> 10 × 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn, plus either new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. In the ablation context, MI is met by any one of: detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST-T changes or new LBBB) that persist for more than 1 hour, development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality.

### Cardiac biomarkers predict mortality in emergency patients presenting with atrial fibrillation [^114RQtcj]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Indicating substantially increased mid-term mortality in patients with symptomatic AF, NT-proBNP and hs-TnT could help deciding whether hospitalisation and/or specific long-term management are expedient in high-risk patients. Due to the increased risk of all-cause mortality, an extensive screening and more aggressive treatment stratified by elevated NT-proBNP or/and hs-TnT might be considered in AF-patients presenting to an ED.

Coronary Angiography Is Performed at Higher Troponin Levels

Coronary angiography was performed in < 7% of patients presenting with AF who had troponin measured. Below the ULN for troponin, higher troponin levels were not associated with an increased likelihood of coronary angiography. Above the ULN, there was an exponential relationship between troponin level and likelihood of coronary angiography. However, even at the highest troponin levels, less than half of patients underwent coronary angiography. This is consistent with typical clinical practice; small troponin increases in AF presentations are not deemed to be a useful marker of CAD by clinicians and even when troponin increases to high values, alternative explanations are often invoked. Other factors also influenced the likelihood of coronary angiography in this population: understandably, patients with malignancies were less likely to undergo coronary angiography and patients with prior infarcts were more likely to undergo coronary angiography. However, women were also less likely to undergo coronary angiography than men, despite other variances being accounted for in the multivariate analysis. This reflects a growing understanding that women with cardiac disease present, and are managed, in different ways to men, potentially to the detriment of women's health outcomes.

Coronary Angiography Alters the Troponin‐Mortality Relationship

In patients who underwent coronary angiography, higher troponin levels above ULN were associated with higher mortality, but the relationship was weak, with a shallow gradient, and not statistically significant. In patients who did not undergo coronary angiography, there was a clear, direct relationship between higher troponin levels (above ULN) and higher risk of mortality. Coronary angiography appeared to be associated with a 36% reduction in mortality across the spectrum of troponin values. One possible explanation for this is that we may be selecting a relatively low‐risk group of patients for coronary angiography compared with those we choose to treat medically. An alternative explanation is that invasive management may improve the prognosis of patients presenting with AF and abnormal troponin elevations, with greater improvement at higher troponin levels. Coronary angiography at higher troponin levels is more likely to reveal clinically important CAD that is amenable to prognosis‐improving treatment. Data on the rate of medical therapy for CAD were not available in this analysis, but coronary revascularization was performed in 36.1% of patients who underwent coronary angiography and there was a trend toward improved mortality with revascularization, although this did not reach statistical significance. The utility of routinely investigating for CAD in these patients requires testing in clinical trials.

### Prognostic value of troponin I in atrial fibrillation [^115w7xxY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are associated with worst outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Consecutive patients visiting the emergency room (ER) with a new episode of a previously diagnosed AF or a new diagnosis of AF during ER admission between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2015, were enrolled in the study (n = 2617). After applying exclusion criteria and eliminating repeated episodes, 2013 patients were finally included. Of these, 1080 patients with at least one cTnI measurement in the ER were selected and classified into 4 groups according to cTnI quartiles: Q1 (n = 147) cTnI < 10 ng/L (Group 1); Q2 (n = 254): 10–19 ng/L (Group 2); Q3 (n = 409): 20–40 ng/L (Group 3); and Q4 (n = 270): cTnI > 40 ng/L (Group 4). The median follow-up period was 47.8 ± 32.8 months. The primary endpoint was all-cause death during the follow-up.

Results

A higher mortality was found in group 4 compared with the other groups (58.9% vs. 28.5%, respectively, p < 0.001), along with, hospitalizations (40.4% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.004), and readmissions due to decompensated heart failure (26.7% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.002). The probability of survival without AF recurrences was lower in the Q4 (p = 0.045). Moreover, cTnI levels > 40 ng/L (Q4) were an independent risk factor of death (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.64–2.51; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The assessment of cTnI at ER admission could be a useful strategy for risk stratification of patients diagnosed with AF by identifying a subgroup with medium-term to long-term increased risk of adverse events and mortality.

### Prognostic significance of troponin level in 3121 patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (the NIHR health informatics collaborative TROP-AF study) [^117Fi9Lb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Troponin Level

All analyses on troponin were performed using the peak troponin level. For patients who had a single troponin measurement, the peak troponin was based on this measurement. In the remainder of the patients who had > 1 troponin test in the same hospital episode of care, the peak troponin value was defined as the highest of all measurements. For patients with multiple episodes of care for which troponin was tested, the first episode of care was used.

In clinical practice, troponin levels are frequently dichotomized into "positive" (meaning > 99th percentile of the upper limit of normal [ULN] for the troponin assay) or "negative". Furthermore, troponin levels may have a progressive relationship with prognosis, too, but the shape of this relationship is not known across the full spectrum of values; and making the assumption of a linear relationship of mortality with troponin (or log troponin) may not be secure in our study participants.

For these reasons, we treated the data in 2 ways. First, we dichotomized the results as being either positive or negative. Second, we used troponin on a continuous scale by standardizing the many troponin assays, by scaling the results using the ratio of the observed troponin value divided by the ULN for that particular troponin assay.

Coronary Angiography and Revascularization

Patients undergoing coronary angiography, or revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, during the follow‐up period were identified. To account for outpatient procedures, patients were categorized as having angiography or intervention if performed within 3 months of the peak troponin level.

Follow‐Up

Using a retrospective cohort study design, all patients were followed up until death or censoring on April 1, 2017. Life status was ascertained using routinely collected data on the National Health Service Spine Application, which was linked to the Office of National Statistics, and thereby to the national registry of deaths.

### Cardiac biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in patients with atrial fibrillation: a randomized evaluation of long-term anticoagulation therapy (RE-LY) substudy [^113HPbQz]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac biomarkers are strong predictors of adverse outcomes in several patient populations. We evaluated the prevalence of elevated troponin I and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and their association to cardiovascular events in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial.

Methods and Results

Biomarkers at randomization were analyzed in 6189 patients. Outcomes were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors and the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc risk scores. Patients were stratified based on troponin I concentrations: < 0.010 μg/L, n = 2663; 0.010 to 0.019 μg/L, n = 2006; 0.020 to 0.039 μg/L, n = 1023; ≥ 0.040 μg/L, n = 497; and on NT-proBNP concentration quartiles: < 387; 387 to 800; 801 to 1402; > 1402 ng/L. Rates of stroke were independently related to levels of troponin I with 2.09%/year in the highest and 0.84%/year in the lowest troponin I group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99 [95% CI, 1.17–3.39]; P = 0.0040), and to NT-proBNP with 2.30%/year versus 0.92% in the highest versus lowest NT-proBNP quartile groups, (HR, 2.40 [95% CI, 1.41–4.07]; P = 0.0014). Vascular mortality was also independently related to biomarker levels with 6.56%/year in the highest and 1.04%/year the lowest troponin I group (HR, 4.38 [95% CI, 3.05–6.29]; P < 0.0001), and 5.00%/year in the highest and 0.61%/year in the lowest NT-proBNP quartile groups (HR, 6.73 [3.95–11.49]; P < 0.0001). Biomarkers increased the C-statistic from 0.68 to 0.72, P < 0.0001, for a composite of thromboembolic events.

Conclusions

Elevations of troponin I and NT-proBNP are common in patients with AF and independently related to increased risks of stroke and mortality. Cardiac biomarkers seem useful for improving risk prediction in AF beyond currently used clinical variables.

### Cardiac troponin is associated with cardiac outcomes in men and women with atrial fibrillation, insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^115CaNgN]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) concentrations provide strong prognostic information in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether the associations between cardiac troponin concentrations and mortality and morbidity differ by sex is not known.

Objectives

To assess whether men and women have different concentrations and prognostic value of cTnT and cTnI measurements in anticoagulated patients with AF.

Methods

cTnT and cTnI concentrations were measured with high-sensitivity (hs) assays in EDTA plasma samples obtained from the multicentre ARISTOTLE trial, which randomized patients with AF and at least one risk factor for stroke or systemic embolic event to warfarin or apixaban. Patients were stratified according to sex and the associations between hs-troponin concentrations, and all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolic event and major bleeding were assessed in multivariable regression models.

Results

We found higher cardiac troponin concentrations in men (n = 9649) compared to women (n = 5331), both for hs-cTnT (median 11.8 [Q1–3 8.1–18.0] vs. 9.6 [6.7–14.3] ng L -1, P < 0.001) and hs-cTnI (5.8 [3.4–10.8] vs. 4.9 [3.1–8.8] ng L -1, P < 0.001). Adjusting for baseline demographics, comorbidities and medications, men still had significantly higher hs-troponin concentrations than women. C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations were higher in female patients. Both hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concentrations were associated with all clinical outcomes similarly in men and women (p-value for interaction > 0.05 for all end-points).

Conclusion

Men have higher hs-troponin concentrations than women in AF. Regardless of sex, hs-troponin concentrations remain similarly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in anticoagulated patients with AF.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration and risk of first-ever Cardiovascular outcomes in 154, 052 participants [^11769HHQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Biological mechanisms

The traditional view has been that cardiac troponins are elevated in case of myocardial necrosis only; however, evidence has emerged that other heart diseases such as atrial fibrillationand cardiac structural and functional abnormalities, can also lead to modest increases in cardiac troponin concentrations in circulation. Another relevant factor could be subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Coronary angiography studies have shown close correlations between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and cardiac troponin concentration. It is speculated that clinically silent ruptures of coronary plaques trigger microembolizations and, consequently, the shedding of troponin from cardiomyocytes via membranous blebs. A third mechanism could be the link between cardiac troponin concentration and cardiac stress characterized by activation of the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. This relationship has been demonstrated in patients with heart failure.

### Identification of functional genetic determinants of cardiac troponin T and I in a multiethnic population and causal associations with atrial fibrillation [^114msCsA]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated cardiac troponin levels in blood are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Cardiac troponin levels are heritable, but their genetic architecture remains elusive.

Methods

We conducted a transethnic genome-wide association analysis on high-sensitivity cTnT (cardiac troponin T; hs-cTnT) and high-sensitivity cTnI (cardiac troponin I; hs-cTnI) levels in 24617 and 14336 participants free of coronary heart disease and heart failure from 6 population-based cohorts, followed by a series of bioinformatic analyses to decipher the genetic architecture of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI.

Results

We identified 4 genome-wide significant loci for hs-cTnT including a novel locus rs3737882 in PPFIA4 and 3 previously reported loci at NCOA2, TRAM1, and BCL2. One known locus at VCL was replicated for hs-cTnI. One copy of C allele for rs3737882 was associated with a 6% increase in hs-cTnT levels (minor allele frequency, 0.18; P = 2.80×10–9). We observed pleiotropic loci located at BAG3 and ANO5. The proportions of variances explained by single-nucleotide polymorphisms were 10.15% and 7.74% for hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI, respectively. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were colocalized with BCL2 expression in heart tissues and hs-cTnT and with ANO5 expression in artery, heart tissues, and whole blood and both troponins. Mendelian randomization analyses showed that genetically increased hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI levels were associated with higher odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.25–1.54] for hs-cTnT and 1.21 [95% CI, 1.06–1.37] for hs-cTnI).

Conclusions

We identified a novel genetic locus associated with hs-cTnT in a multiethnic population and found that genetically regulated troponin levels were associated with atrial fibrillation.

### Preprocedural troponin T levels predict the improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation / flutter [^113S5rWs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Troponins

Cardiac troponins are sensitive markers of cardiac injury and have been widely used for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. However, recent evidence using the developed assay with an improved sensitivity suggest that cardiac troponins can be elevated in chronic disease states, including stable coronary arterial disease, heart failure, 13 and AF/AFL, and apparently healthy subjects. 14 However, the origin behind an elevated cardiac troponin level is still under debate, and the pathophysiology behind the serum troponin T may be distinct from that seen during myocardial infarctions. It may be attributable to mechanisms such as an oxygen demand/mismatch and myocardial ischemia, volume and pressure overloads, changes in the microvascular blood flow, atrial calcium overload, oxidative stress, or alterations in the tissue structure. 15 The results are consistent in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy: persistently increasing troponin T concentrations were associated with ongoing deterioration of the cardiac function and adverse outcomes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 16 and the patients with elevated hs‐TnT values (> 14 pg/mL) had significantly more frequent cardiac events than did those with normal values. 17 These data suggested that troponin T was a quantitative marker that could indicate the presence of injury and the extent of damage to myocardial cells, and that an elevated troponin T level indicated persistent subclinical myocyte degeneration.

In patients with heart failure and/or AF/AFL, elevated troponin levels are also associated with more severe disease and a worse outcome. 16, 18, 19 In the present study, the preprocedural echocardiographic parameters were comparable between the responders and nonresponders, but the hs‐TnT level was lower in the responders than nonresponders. Furthermore, the preprocedural hs‐TnT level was the only independent predictor of the recovery of the LV function after the ablation. The magnitude of reverse remodeling of the LVDs and LAD following the ablation was greater in the responders than in the nonresponders, and the preprocedural hs‐TnT levels correlated with the ΔLVEF and ΔLVDs. These data suggested that a preprocedural hs‐TnT level, not a preprocedural echocardiographic parameter, was a sensitive and useful predictor of reverse structural remodeling including the recovery of the LV dysfunction in AF/AFL patients with LV systolic dysfunction following the ablation. It is well known that reverse structural remodeling more likely occurs in patients who have a relatively healthy myocardium with less fibrosis. 10 In this study, the responders might have had a healthier myocardium with less fibrosis than the nonresponders, and the preprocedural hs‐TnT levels could detect latent myocardial damage. 19

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^113MAtRM]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Circulating high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) is associated with incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the association of changes in hs‐cTnT over time on incident AF has not been explored.

Hypothesis

Six‐year increase in circulating hs‐cTnT will be associated with increased risk of AF and will contribute to improved prediction of incident AF.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of 8431 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. hs‐cTnT change was categorized at visit 2 and 4 as undetectable (< 5 ng/L), detectable (≥ 5 ng/L, < 14 ng/L), or elevated (≥ 14 ng/L). We used Cox regression to examine the association between the combination of hs‐cTnT categories at two visits and incident AF. We also assessed the impact of adding absolute hs‐cTnT change on risk discrimination for AF by C‐statistics and net reclassification improvement (NRI).

Results

Over a mean follow‐up of 16.5 years, 1629 incident AF cases were diagnosed. Among participants with undetectable hs‐cTnT at visit 2, the multivariable HR of AF was 1.28 (95% CI 1.12–1.48) among those with detectable or elevated hs‐cTnT at visit 4 compared to those in which hs‐cTnT remained undetectable. Among those with detectable hs‐cTnT at visit 2, compared to those who remained in the detectable hs‐cTnT group, reduction to undetectable at visit 4 was associated with lower risk of AF (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59–0.94), while increment to elevated was associated with higher AF risk (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01–1.68). Adding hs‐cTnT change to our main model with baseline hs‐cTnT did not result in significant improvement in the C‐statistic or substantial NRI.

Conclusion

Six‐year increase in circulating hs‐cTnT was associated with elevated risk of incident AF.

### Association between troponin levels and embolic stroke of undetermined source [^115PstYN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to determine whether patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source have higher rates of elevated troponin than patients with noncardioembolic strokes.

Methods and Results

CAESAR (The Cornell Acute Stroke Academic Registry) prospectively enrolled all adults with acute stroke from 2011 to 2014. Two neurologists used standard definitions to retrospectively ascertain the etiology of stroke, with a third resolving disagreements. In this analysis we included patients withand, as controls, patients with small‐ and large‐artery strokes; only patients with a troponin measured within 24 hours of stroke onset were included. A troponin elevation was defined as a value exceeding our laboratory's upper limit (0.04 ng/mL) without a clinically recognized acute‐segment elevation myocardial infarction. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between troponin elevation andafter adjustment for demographics, stroke severity, insular infarction, and vascular risk factors. In a sensitivity analysis we excluded patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after discharge. Among 512 patients, 243 (47.5%) had, and 269 (52.5%) had small‐ or large‐artery stroke. In multivariable analysis an elevated troponin was independently associated with(odds ratio 3.3; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 8.8). This result was unchanged after excluding patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after discharge (odds ratio 3.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3, 9.1), and the association remained significant when troponin was considered a continuous variable (odds ratio for log[troponin], 1.4; 95% confidence interval 1.1, 1.7).

Conclusions

Elevations in cardiac troponin are more common in patients withthan in those with noncardioembolic strokes.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^114gCf8P]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure continuum — proposed revised stages define At risk for heart failure (HF) (Stage A) as "Patients at risk for HF, but without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF and without structural cardiac changes or elevated biomarkers of heart disease", including those with "hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, known exposure to cardiotoxins, a positive family history of cardiomyopathy, or genetic cardiomyopathy", noting that "risk factor intervention may be warranted". Pre-HF (Stage B) includes "Patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF with evidence of one of the following:" structural heart disease (e.g., "left ventricular hypertrophy", "cardiac chamber enlargement", "ventricular wall motion abnormality", and myocardial tissue abnormalities by cardiac magnetic resonance), abnormal cardiac function ("reduced left or right ventricular systolic function, evidence of increased filling pressures… abnormal diastolic dysfunction", which "can be characterized by reduced EF, abnormal ventricular strain, or other noninvasive or invasive modalities"), or biomarkers ("Elevated natriuretic peptide levels (for levels, refer to Table 8) or elevated cardiac troponin levels (> 99th percentile in a normal reference population)"). Heart failure (Stage C) is "Patients with current or prior symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality". The document adds that "we did not specifically include genetic markers in the definition of pre-HF or Stage B HF", and that natriuretic peptide "cutoffs… represent thresholds lower than inclusion criteria used in some clinical trials", with thresholds that "may have lower specificity especially in older patients, or patients with atrial fibrillation or CKD", and "Usually, higher cutoff values are recommended for the diagnosis of HF in these patients".

### Mechanistic pathways underlying genetic predisposition to atrial fibrillation are associated with different cardiac phenotypes and cardioembolic stroke risk [^1135HSyT]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

High-Sensitivity Troponins

To evaluate whether changes in LA function and biomarkers of LV dysfunction were linked to myocardial injury, we investigated associations with high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI; multiancestry population of 48 115 individualsand in a separate multiancestry population of 14 336 individuals free from prevalent coronary heart disease or heart failure) and high-sensitivity troponin T (24 617 multiancestry individuals free from prevalent coronary heart disease or heart failure) using GWAS summary data.

We found no differences between the biological pathways in terms of their associations with hsTnI or high-sensitivity troponin T (P for heterogeneity 0.14 and 0.36 for the hsTnI cohorts, and 0.85 for the high-sensitivity troponin T cohort;).

The 142-variant set was not associated with higher hsTnI levels in the general population; however, it was associated with a slightly higher level of both troponin I and troponin T in multiethnic populations free from prevalent coronary heart disease or heart failure.

Overall, these data provide further evidence that different mechanisms underlying the genetic risk of AF are associated with distinct cardiac phenotypes and suggest that the muscle pathway is associated with biomarkers of LV dysfunction, and not myocardial injury, in addition to LA dysfunction.

### Troponin elevation after radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: relevance to AF substrate, procedural outcomes, and reverse structural remodeling [^111j6xaW]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although radiofrequency ablation creates myocardial necrosis leading to troponin T (TnT) release into the systemic circulation, the significance of TnT elevation after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is unknown.

Objective

To demonstrate a possible mechanism of reverse structural remodeling in the left atrium (LA) by evaluating postprocedural TnT elevation.

Methods

This study included 106 patients with an enlarged LA (paroxysmal AF, n = 43; persistent AF, n = 63). All patients underwent pulmonary vein isolation alone in the index procedure. Left atrial volume indexed to body surface area (LAVi) was measured by echocardiography before ablation and 6 months after sinus rhythm restoration. Patients were divided into responders (n = 53) and nonresponders (n = 53) based on a cutoff value of 23% reduction in LAVi. The TnT level was measured 12 hours postprocedure.

Results

LAVi decreased from 43 ± 13 to 33 ± 12 mL/m(2) (P < .0001). The TnT level was higher in responders than in nonresponders (1.31 ± 0.34 μg/L vs 0.88 ± 0.29 μg/L; P < .0001) and correlated linearly with percent reduction in LAVi (R = .54; P < .0001). Also in multivariate analysis, the TnT level was the only independent predictor for responders (odds ratio 90.1; 95% confidence interval 14.95–543.3; P < .0001). The TnT level in patients who required a repeat procedure (n = 30) was lower than that in patients who did not require a repeat procedure only in the persistent AF group (0.92 ± 0.38 μg/L vs 1.16 ± 0.37 μg/L; p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Greater elevation of the TnT level was related both to favorable outcomes after ablation and to greater reversal of structural remodeling. Postprocedural TnT level may be reflective of the preservation of healthy LA myocardium.

### Troponin elevation after ischemic stroke and future cardiovascular risk: is the heart in the right place? [^117Mhsv9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

This study in question has some noteworthy limitations including lack of data on antithrombotic medication initiation or resumption after stroke, a treatment strategy proven to decrease cardiovascular risk. 10 Moreover, the study examined baseline comorbidities, and did not account for changes in risk factors or new diagnoses over time. Furthermore, the study did have information on stroke subtype, which may be relevant to the degree of myocardial injury. It would also be interesting to note the differences in troponin elevation in patients with and without occult sources of cardiac embolism such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombus, and severe heart failure.

Nevertheless, the results of this study raise some intriguing points. First, isolated transient myocardial injury after stroke is not a benign finding despite the normalization of troponin values, similar to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Second, the question that arises is whether myocardial injury after stroke is a chicken or egg phenomenon? Our current state of literature does not allow this temporal distinction. Transient troponin elevation, a manifestation of neurocardiogenic injury can occur in up to half of all stroke patients and is believed to be mediated by a catecholamine surge and microvascular coronary endothelial dysfunction, among other mechanisms, which ultimately leads to myocardial remodeling weeks to months after the initial injury. 1 On the other hand, myocardial injury in some cases, may be a consequence of an underlying cardiac embolic source and may provide clues to the stroke mechanisms particularly in the absence of occult causes. For instance, in a prospective cohort study of 1234 patients with ischemic stroke, early positive troponin was associated with a cardioembolic source, and did not correlate with stroke severity. 11 Since nearly a third of strokes have no identifiable cause, a subset generally referred to cryptogenic stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), an improved understanding of myocardial injury may help guide interpretation of cardiac biomarker derangements in the clinical setting. 12 Clinicians have increasingly recognized the role of non‐traditional cardiac sources of emboli under the ESUS construct, with emphasis on atrial cardiopathy and silent myocardial infarction. 12 This has spurred a new line of investigation evaluating parameters on cardiac evaluations, otherwise neglected in prior years, including atrial chamber dilation on echocardiography and p‐wave terminal force or Q wave on electrocardiography. Along similar lines, re‐exploration of serum biomarkers of cardiac injury, which is relatively inexpensive and perhaps more feasible, are warranted.

### Association of troponin levels with mortality in Italian patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: results of a multicenter study [^116NWFF6]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, has been associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the initial data were reported from single-center or 2-center studies in Chinese populations. Compared with these patients, European and US patients are older, with more comorbidities and higher mortality rates.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, in a large population of White Italian patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolling consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 13 Italian cardiology units from March 1 to April 9, 2020. Patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome were excluded. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values greater than the 99th percentile of normal values.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical characteristics and outcomes stratified as elevated or normal cardiac troponin levels at admission, defined as troponin T or troponin I at a level greater than the 99th percentile of normal values.

Results

A total of 614 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study (mean age [SD], 67 [13] years; 70.8% male), of whom 148 patients (24.1%) died during the hospitalization. Elevated troponin levels were found in 278 patients (45.3%). These patients were older (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.6] years vs 71.3 [12.0] years; P < .001) and had higher prevalence of hypertension (168 patients [50.5%] vs 182 patients [65.9%]; P < .001), heart failure (24 [7.2%]; 63 [22.8%]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (50 [15.0%] vs 87 [31.5%]; P < .001), and atrial fibrillation (33 [9.9%] vs 67 [24.3%]; P < .001). Elevated troponin levels were associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (37% vs 13%; HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.13–2.59]; p = 0.01 via multivariable Cox regression analysis), and this was independent from concomitant cardiac disease. Elevated troponin levels were also associated with a higher risk of in-hospital complications: heart failure (44 patients [19.2%] vs 7 patients [2.9%]; P < .001), sepsis (31 [11.7%] vs 21 [6.4%]; p = 0.03), acute kidney failure (41 [20.8%] vs 13 [6.2%]; P < .001), multiorgan failure (21 [10.9%] vs 6 [2.9%]; p = 0.003), pulmonary embolism (27 [9.9%] vs 17 [5.2%]; p = 0.04), delirium (13 [6.8%] vs 3 [1.5%]; p = 0.02), and major bleeding (16 [7.0%] vs 4 [1.6%]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicenter, cross-sectional study of Italian patients with COVID-19, elevated troponin was an independent variable associated with in-hospital mortality and a greater risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications during a hospitalization for COVID-19.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study [^112fjYoe]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Structural changes in the heart are known risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF). An association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), a marker of myocardial cell damage measured with a high-sensitivity assay, and the risk of AF could have implications for AF risk stratification.

Objective

To estimate the association between hs-cTnT and the risk of incident AF in the ARIC study, a prospective cohort of middle-aged adults from 4 US communities.

Methods

Study included 10,584 participants (mean age 62.7 years) free of AF in 1996 to 1998 and followed through 2008. Atrial fibrillation was defined using International Classification of Diseases codes from hospitalizations and death certificates. Participants with undetectable hs-cTnT levels (58%) were assigned the lower limit of measurement (5 ng/L). Net reclassification improvement was used to examine the discriminative ability of hs-cTnT for 10-year AF risk prediction (categories: < 5%, 5%-15%, and > 15%).

Results

A total of 920 incident AF cases were observed for 109,227 person-years. After adjustment, a 1-SD difference in ln(hs-cTnT) was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 1.10–1.23). Compared with those with undetectable levels, participants with hs-cTnT ≥ 14 ng/L had a hazard ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.43–2.24). Addition of hs-cTnT to known AF predictors did not increase the c statistic appreciably (0.756 vs 0.758) or improve risk stratification (net reclassification improvement 0.4%, 95% CI -1.4% to 2.3%).

Conclusions

High-sensitivity cTnT level is associated with an increased incidence rate of AF but did not improve risk stratification.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^116p6Tuh]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Circulating high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the association of changes in hs-cTnT over time on incident AF has not been explored.

Hypothesis

Six-year increase in circulating hs-cTnT will be associated with increased risk of AF and will contribute to improved prediction of incident AF.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of 8431 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. hs-cTnT change was categorized at visit 2 and 4 as undetectable (< 5 ng/L), detectable (≥ 5 ng/L, < 14ng/L), or elevated (≥ 14ng/L). We used Cox regression to examine the association between the combination of hs-cTnT categories at two visits and incident AF. We also assessed the impact of adding absolute hs-cTnT change on risk discrimination for AF by C-statistics and net reclassification improvement (NRI).

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 16.5years, 1629 incident AF cases were diagnosed. Among participants with undetectable hs-cTnT at visit 2, the multivariable HR of AF was 1.28 (95% CI 1.12–1.48) among those with detectable or elevated hs-cTnT at visit 4 compared to those in which hs-cTnT remained undetectable. Among those with detectable hs-cTnT at visit 2, compared to those who remained in the detectable hs-cTnT group, reduction to undetectable at visit 4 was associated with lower risk of AF (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59–0.94), while increment to elevated was associated with higher AF risk (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01–1.68). Adding hs-cTnT change to our main model with baseline hs-cTnT did not result in significant improvement in the C-statistic or substantial NRI.

Conclusion

Six-year increase in circulating hs-cTnT was associated with elevated risk of incident AF.

### High-sensitivity troponin as a biomarker in heart rhythm disease [^1147TR2T]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Biomarkers are important prognostic tools in various cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease and heart failure. Although their utility in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) is less established, biomarkers may guide EP clinical practice by identifying patients at risk for developing arrhythmias and their complications, in addition to augmenting therapeutic decisions by targeting appropriate pharmacologic and interventional therapies to patients who may benefit most. In this review, we focus on the prognostic role of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays-which detect subclinical cardiac myocyte damage-in cardiac arrhythmias and their sequelae. We review the current literature on hs-cTn and its impact on various arrhythmia disease states and also provide suggestions for future research in this field. In conclusion, although the utility of hs-cTn assays remains at an investigational stage in cardiac EP, studies to date have suggested value as a prognostic biomarker in atrial fibrillation and as a screening marker for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (both in the general population and among those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).

### Association between troponin I levels during sepsis and postsepsis cardiovascular complications [^1173uMvR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Sepsis commonly results in elevated serum troponin levels and increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications; however, the association between troponin levels during sepsis and cardiovascular complications after sepsis is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the association between serum troponin levels during sepsis and 1 year after sepsis cardiovascular events. Methods: We analyzed adults aged ⩾40 years without preexisting cardiovascular disease within 5 years, admitted with sepsis across 21 hospitals from 2011 to 2017. Peak serum troponin I levels during sepsis were grouped as normal (≤ 0.04 ng/ml) or tertiles of abnormal (> 0.04 to ≤ 0.09 ng/ml, > 0.09 to ≤ 0.42 ng/ml, or > 0.42 ng/ml). Multivariable adjusted cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with death as a competing risk were used to assess associations between peak troponin I levels and a composite cardiovascular outcome (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) in the year following sepsis. Models were adjusted for presepsis and intrasepsis factors considered potential confounders. Measurements and Main Results: Among 14,046 eligible adults with troponin I measured, 2,012 (14.3%) experienced the composite cardiovascular outcome, including 832 (10.9%) patients with normal troponin levels, as compared with 370 (17.3%), 376 (17.6%), and 434 (20.3%) patients within each sequential abnormal troponin tertile, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients within the elevated troponin tertiles had increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] troponin0.04–0.09 = 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.55; aHR troponin0.09–0.42 = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27–1.63; and aHR troponin&gt;0.42 = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56–2.00). Conclusions: Among patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease, troponin elevation during sepsis identified patients at increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications. Strategies to mitigate cardiovascular complications among this high-risk subset of patients are warranted.

### Serial assessment of biomarkers and heart failure outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111hsLVR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Cardiac functional and structural remodelling in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) contributes to development of heart failure (HF) as their major cardiovascular comorbidity. Circulating biomarkers may reflect these cardiac alterations.

Methods and Results

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was a randomized trial of edoxaban versus warfarin in 21105 patients with AF. We performed a nested biomarker study, analysing high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT, n = 8705), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, n = 8765), and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15, n = 8705) at baseline and 12months. Of the biomarker cohort, 5207 had a history of HF, among whom 3996 had known ejection fraction (EF): 926 with reduced EF (HFrEF; ≤ 40%), 1043 with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF; 40–49%), and 2027 with preserved EF (HFpEF; ≥ 50%). Elevated baseline hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and GDF-15 were associated with higher risk of hospitalization for HF (HHF) or HF death overall and in subpopulations defined by HF history and EF (p < 0.001 for each). These associations of outcome with each biomarker were consistent regardless of a history of HF or EF (p-interaction > 0.05 for each). Patients who had an increase in or had persistently elevated values in any of the three biomarkers over 12months were at higher risk for HHF or HF death in the overall population (p < 0.001 for each biomarker and category).

Conclusion

Serial measurement of hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and GDF-15 revealed that higher baseline values, and increasing or persistently elevated values over 1year are associated with higher risk of HF outcomes in patients with AF regardless of HF history or HF phenotype based on EF.

### Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis? Check troponin, too [^1134kXz9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

It is not the first time that the troponin levels have been studied in the setting of TAVI. Different smaller series 2, 3 have suggested pre‐procedural high‐sensitivity troponin T as a prognostic factor of mortality but the significance of post‐TAVI troponin rise still remained controversial. 4, 5, 6 In the recently published PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial in patients with known coronary artery disease, higher baseline levels of troponin were associated with a significantly greater risk of a composite of death, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina as well as an elevated risk of cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction at 1 year. 6 Overall, elevated baseline troponin levels may indicate myocardial damage, left ventricular hypertrophy, and advanced stages of cardiomyopathy and it is not a surprise to detect elevated high‐sensitivity troponin levels in elderly patients in need for aortic valve replacement. Nevertheless, it is hard to attribute the baseline troponin elevation to a specific factor as the increased sensitivity of this test comes at a cost of decreased specificity. In the present study by Akodad and colleagues, 4 independent predictors of pre‐procedural troponin values were identified: male sex, atrial arrhythmia, low glomerular filtration rate, and pre‐procedural N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide. Patients who had normal or near‐normal troponin before the procedure were younger, with less atrial fibrillation or vascular disease, better left ventricular ejection fraction, better renal function, and lower N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide levels. In everyday practice we see patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response to frequently "leak" troponins, especially if there is underlying coronary artery disease. Similarly, patients with congestive heart failure have elevated troponins in the setting of fluid overload, especially if there is underlying renal dysfunction and slower troponin clearance. Once the heart rate is well controlled or the patients' volume status is optimized, the troponin levels usually downtrend and go back to normal. The typical patients undergoing TAVI are elderly and they usually have different comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, low ejection fraction, and renal dysfunction. It would be difficult to address all these issues before the procedure; however, all these risk factors are modifiable and can be controlled with medical management. An elevated pre‐procedural troponin level may indicate some fluid overload in 1 patient or some baseline tachycardia in another but based on the findings of this trial both groups of patients incur adverse long‐term outcomes compared with medically optimized patients.

### Cardiac troponin release after endurance exercise: still much to learn [^113myAMi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of high‐sensitivity troponin assays enables safe, robust, and early exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in the emergency department. Temporary elevation of troponins is, however, a common finding in a wide variety of medical conditions (eg, systemic infections, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, and atrial fibrillation). 1 Since 1987, numerous studies have demonstrated that troponin levels above the rule‐in criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction are common also after strenuous exercise in presumably healthy individuals. 2 The pathophysiological characteristics of exercise‐induced elevations in cardiac troponins remain unclear. Proposed mechanisms include the concept that a small proportion of free troponin molecules circulate in the cytosol of the cardiomyocyte. These molecules may be released into the extracellular space after an exercise‐induced reversible cell injury, which causes a temporary increase in membrane permeability. This, in turn, allows intact or degraded troponin fragments to enter the bloodstream. 3 Other potential candidates suggested include cardiomyocyte necrosis or apoptosis.

### Biomarkers in atrial fibrillation: a clinical review [^114KtxtX]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF)-associated stroke risk is at present mainly based on clinical risk scores such as CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc, although these scores provide only modest discrimination of risk for individual patients. Biomarkers derived from the blood may help refine risk assessment in AF for stroke outcomes and for mortality. Recent studies of biomarkers in AF have shown that they can substantially improve risk stratification. Cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin and natriuretic peptides, significantly improve risk stratification in addition to current clinical risk stratification models. Similar findings have recently been described for markers of renal function, coagulation, and inflammation in AF populations based on large randomized prospective clinical trials or large community-based cohorts. These new findings may enable development of novel tools to improve clinical risk assessment in AF. Biomarkers in AF may also improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of AF further as well as potentially elucidate novel treatment targets. This review will highlight novel associations of biomarkers and outcomes in AF as well as recent progress in the use of biomarkers for risk stratification.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^111y6ZES]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Based on the subgroup of patients with chronic AF taken from an intermediate- to high-risk ACS cohort, we defined potential diagnostic troponin I thresholds. The optimized cut-off to discriminate patients with type 1 MI of 0.04 ng/mL was slightly higher compared with the 99th percentile cut-off of 0.032 ng/mL. Additionally, as a major concern regarding the influence of AF is loss in specificity, we calculated a troponin I concentration that was associated with 90% specificity that might facilitate rule-in. Measurement of troponin I on admission and application of the 99th percentile thresholds in 314 patients with chronic AF taken from a large, multicenter, real-world cohort of patients with suspected ACS led to the expected lower specificity with a positive predictive value of 71% compared with 80.9% if using the whole cohort of 1,818 patients. To validly rule in patients, use of the calculated specificity-optimized threshold improved this positive predictive value to 88%. Concerning rule-out of type 1 MI, troponin I determination 3 hours after admission was associated with a negative predictive value of 100% if using the 99th percentile cut-off or an optimized threshold. Based on the assumption that myocardial necrosis is associated with a larger increase in cardiac troponin compared with troponin release due to ischemic imbalance, use of the change in troponin concentration should further facilitate diagnostic discrimination. This is supported by our data showing that patients with type 1 MI have larger changes in troponin I concentration within 3 hours after presentation compared with patients without type 1 MI (Fig. 2). This translates into an improvement of the positive predictive value of more than 95% with a 3-hour change criterion of 40% in combination with the use of an optimized diagnostic troponin I threshold upon admission.

### Association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and risk of stroke in 96 702 individuals: a meta-analysis [^115rn16o]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Our study aim was to estimate risk of incident stroke based on levels of hs-cTn (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin), a specific biomarker indicating myocardial injury, in the general population, patients with atrial fibrillation, and patients with previous stroke. Methods- Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched until March 14, 2019 to identify relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the risk of incident stroke based on hs-cTn were eligible. Pooled adjusted hazard ratios including 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model due to study heterogeneity per population, coding of hs-cTn (categorical/continuous data), per hs-cTn subunit (T or I), for low risk of bias, and for all-cause and ischemic stroke separately. Results- We included 17 articles with 96702 participants. In studies conducted in the general population (n = 12; 77780 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.25 (CI, 1.10–1.40) for high versus low hs-cTn (as defined by included studies) during an average follow-up of 1 to 20 years (median 10). When categorical data were used, this was increased to 1.58 (CI, 1.26–1.90). The results were robust when accounting for stroke classification (all-cause stroke/ischemic stroke), hs-cTn subunit, risk of bias, and coding of hs-cTn. In patients with atrial fibrillation (4 studies; 18725 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.95 (CI, 1.29–2.62) for high versus low hs-cTn. Due to lack of data (one study, 197 participants), no meta-analysis could be performed in patients with previous stroke. Conclusions- This meta-analysis suggests that hs-cTn can be regarded as a risk marker for incident stroke, with different effect size in different subgroups. More research about the association between hs-cTn and incident stroke in high-risk populations is needed, especially in patients with history of ischemic stroke.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^113TQKep]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, however, little is known regarding the association between long‐term circulating hs‐cTnT change with incident AF risk, as well as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The ARIC study has previously reported that 6‐year change in hs‐cTnT was independently associated with death, HF, and incident CHD. Recently, in the Nord‐Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study, the largest population‐based cohort in Norway, investigators examined the temporal changes in cardiac troponin I (hs‐cTnI) with risk of cardiovascular events in the general population. They found that both relative and absolute increases in hs‐cTnI levels were independently associated with cardiovascular risk. Hs‐cTnT and hs‐cTnI are moderately correlated and share some characteristics in predicting AF, so these findings suggested that temporal change in hs‐cTnT could be also associated with cardiovascular risk. Since AF and other cardiovascular diseases are related to each other, long‐term change in hs‐cTnT might provide predictive information on the risk of overall cardiovascular disease among patients with AF.

Biomarkers in AF

Biomarkers have recently generated a lot of interest in prediction, diagnosis and prognostic risk stratification of AF.

Troponin I, natriuretic peptides and norepinephrine levels

An substudy of RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Longterm anticoagulant TherapY) regarding the prognostic value and risk stratification of biomarkers in AF has indicated an interesting use of cardiac biomarkers. They have indicated that serial high levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N Terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) are associated with high incidence of stroke and systemic embolism (HR 4.54) and vascular death (HR 8.62). Others have earlier found similar association between these biomarkers and prognosis in AF. A Japanese study showed higher levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine (NE) in persistent versus PAF. Only elevated NE levels were found to have an association with sick sinus syndrome (figure 3).

NT-pro BNP, N Terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide. CHADS2, Stroke score (based on a 1 point each for Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age more than 75, Diabetes mellitus and 2 points for previous Stroke or TIA.)

Liver enzymes

Elevated circulating levels of liver enzymes are found to have moderately strong association with increased AF incidence in a large prospective community-based cohort study of more than 15 000 subjects. The association was linear and strongest for gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) with doubling of GGT levels leading to 20% increase in AF risk after adjusting for the confounding factors. The association of AF incidence and aspartate amino transferase (AST) and to a lesser extent alanine amino transferase (ALT) showed a U-shaped curve with maximum incidence at the two extremes. This can be explained by right-sided heart failure leading to hepatic congestion or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that increases the cardiovascular risk due to effect on glucose and lipid metabolismCorrelation between deranged LFTs and risk of cardiovascular disease has also been published in a subanalysis from Framingham heart study.

Adiponectin

An association as a function of increasing age was seen between higher circulating adiponectin levels and risk of developing AF. This is paradoxical to the contemporary belief that higher adiponectin levels are cardioprotective. Further work is required in this field to identify a clear association with this novel biomarker.

### Performance and validation of a novel biomarker-based stroke risk score for atrial fibrillation [^113aYKoD]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased but variable risk of stroke. Our aim was to validate the recently developed biomarker-based ABC (age, biomarkers [high-sensitivity troponin and N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide], and clinical history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack)-stroke risk score and compare its performance with the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) risk scores.

Methods

The ABC-stroke score includes age, biomarkers (N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin), and clinical history (prior stroke). This validation was based on 8356 patients, 16137 person-years of follow-up, and 219 adjudicated stroke or systemic embolic events in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY study (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy). Levels of N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were determined in plasma samples obtained at study entry.

Results

The ABC-stroke score was well calibrated with 0.76 stroke/systemic embolic events per 100 person-years in the predefined low (< 1%/y) risk group, 1.48 in the medium (1%-2%/y) risk group, and 2.60 in the high (> 2%/y) risk group for the ABC-stroke score with hs-cTnT. Hazard ratios for stroke/systemic embolic events were 1.95 for medium- versus low-risk groups, and 3.44 for high- versus low-risk groups. ABC-stroke score achieved C indices of 0.65 with both hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI, in comparison with 0.60 for CHA 2 DS 2 VASc (P = 0.004 for hs-cTnT and P = 0.022 hs-cTnI) and 0.61 for ATRIA scores (P = 0.005 hs-cTnT and P = 0.034 for hs-cTnI).

Conclusions

The biomarker-based ABC-stroke score was well calibrated and consistently performed better than both the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc and ATRIA stroke scores. The ABC score should be considered an improved decision support tool in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Detected troponin elevation is associated with high early mortality after lung resection for cancer [^112LNiu6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

After lung surgery, approximately a third of patients with troponin elevation do not have classical symptoms of myocardial infarction. Atrial fibrillation was a common presenting feature leading to the identification of elevated serum troponin. Patients with detected serum troponin elevation are at high risk of early mortality after lung resection for primary lung cancer.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^117GMN3p]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmias — electrocardiographic changes and myocardial injury attribution — require caution in MI classification. In atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, "ST-segment depression or T wave inversion may occur in the absence of CAD". Mechanisms such as "cardiac memory" and tachycardia-induced supply–demand mismatch may explain these findings. Therefore, "a patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation, elevated baseline cTn concentration, and new ST-segment depression should not automatically be classified as type 2 MI without additional information". In this setting, "signs of overt ischemic symptoms, the timing of symptoms relative to atrial fibrillation onset, a changing pattern of cTn, and imaging and/or angiographic findings may be helpful", and "in the absence of evidence for myocardial ischemia, the etiology of the elevated cTn values should be attributed to myocardial injury".

### Association between troponin levels and embolic stroke of undetermined source [^111hVxpb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to determine whether patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS) have higher rates of elevated troponin than patients with noncardioembolic strokes.

Methods and Results

CAESAR (The Cornell Acute Stroke Academic Registry) prospectively enrolled all adults with acute stroke from 2011 to 2014. Two neurologists used standard definitions to retrospectively ascertain the etiology of stroke, with a third resolving disagreements. In this analysis we included patients with ESUS and, as controls, patients with small- and large-artery strokes; only patients with a troponin measured within 24 hours of stroke onset were included. A troponin elevation was defined as a value exceeding our laboratory's upper limit (0.04 ng/mL) without a clinically recognized acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between troponin elevation and ESUS after adjustment for demographics, stroke severity, insular infarction, and vascular risk factors. In a sensitivity analysis we excluded patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after discharge. Among 512 patients, 243 (47.5%) had ESUS, and 269 (52.5%) had small- or large-artery stroke. In multivariable analysis an elevated troponin was independently associated with ESUS (odds ratio 3.3; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 8.8). This result was unchanged after excluding patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after discharge (odds ratio 3.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3, 9.1), and the association remained significant when troponin was considered a continuous variable (odds ratio for log[troponin], 1.4; 95% confidence interval 1.1, 1.7).

Conclusions

Elevations in cardiac troponin are more common in patients with ESUS than in those with noncardioembolic strokes.

### Cardiac biomarkers predict mortality in emergency patients presenting with atrial fibrillation [^1127nEJr]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the predictive value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT) serum levels for mid-term mortality in patients presenting with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) to an emergency department.

Methods

Non-interventional cohort/follow-up study, including consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary care university emergency department due to symptomatic AF between 2012 and 2016. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the mortality rates and hazards per 100 patient-years (pry) for NT-proBNP and hs-TnT serum levels in quintiles.

Results

2574 episodes of 1754 patients (age 68 (IQR 58–75) years, female gender 1199 (44%), CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 3 (IQR 1–4)) were recorded. Following the exclusion of incomplete datasets, 1780 episodes were available for analysis. 162 patients deceased during the mid-term follow-up (median 23 (IQR 4–38) months); the mortality rate was 4.72/100 pry. Hazard for death increased with every quintile of NT-proBNP by 1.53 (HR; 95% CI 1.27 to 1.83; p < 0.001) and by 1.31 (HR; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.55; p = 0.002) with every quintile of hs-TnT in multivariate Cox-regression analysis. No interaction between NT-proBNP and hs-TnT levels could be observed.

Conclusion

Elevated NT-proBNP and hs-TnT levels are independently associated with increased mid-term mortality in patients presenting to an emergency department due to symptomatic AF.

### EHRA / HRS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus on atrial cardiomyopathies: definition, characterization, and clinical implication [^116veL2Y]. Europace (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — prediction of thrombogenesis is discussed with emphasis on biomarker-based risk stratification. The text states, "Addition of vWF refines clinical risk stratification in AF, first shown in the non-anticoagulated or suboptimally anticoagulated patients from the SPAF study", and "More recently, vWF has been related to thromboembolism as well as bleeding risks in anticoagulated AF patients". It further notes, "Ancillary studies from large Phase 3 anticoagulation trials have reported prognostic implications for increased levels of D-dimer, troponin, natriuretic peptides, and novel biomarkers (e.g. GDF15)". The authors caution that "Many of these studies have been performed in selected clinical trial cohorts, and the prognostic role in risk stratification requires prospective testing in unselected large 'real-world' cohorts with a broad range of stroke risk and renal function", and that "As in the case of AF prediction, evidence for the additive value of biomarkers for stroke risk prediction from large prospective non-anticoagulated 'real-world' cohorts is limited".

In line with these being older men, the median baseline hsTnT level in this cohort was ∼12ng/L (the 99th percentile in the healthy population is 14 ng/L) and was only slightly higher in those with clinically identified baseline CHD. CHD is the most obvious cause of elevated troponin, although only a minority of our participants had diagnosed CHD at baseline. However, even in the absence of a diagnosis of CHD, the prevalence of subclinical coronary disease was probably high in the older British men we studied. In addition, other potentially undiagnosed cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation, may cause myocardial ischemia. Hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (which frequently coexist) lead to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation, as well as coronary microvascular dysfunction, which also may raise troponin. Hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, and coronary microvascular dysfunction are also predictors (along with those measured in this study) and precursors of HF. Moreover, those developing HF had a higher baseline NT-proBNP concentration, suggesting preexisting myocardial and/or renal dysfunction. Other noncardiac pathologies, including chronic inflammatory disorders, also are associated with myocardial injury, and the higher baseline CRP in individuals experiencing incident HF is consistent with this pathophysiologic connection as well. Thus, there are mechanisms that might explain why troponin is associated with incident HF in those without diagnosed CHD. Many of these factors were taken into account in our statistical analysis. Future studies should investigate specifically the ability of troponin measurements to predict onset of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.

It may be possible to detect subclinical myocardial injury early and to intervene to reduce the risk of HF. This might be achieved with the use of the measurement of troponin, NT-proBNP, or both to diagnose such patients and thereby target therapy to those at highest risk of HF. Interventions that might be effective include antihypertensive therapies, antiischemic therapies, lipid-lowering treatments, antithrombotic therapy, and, possibly, drugs improving metabolic status (eg, treatments for diabetes and obesity). The small but statistically significant effect of statins in reducing the risk of incident HF, independently from MI, is consistent with this hypothesis. A recent example of a hypotensive agent which also lowers troponin is sacubitril/valsartan (formerly LCZ696). Prevention of myocardial injury to reduce risk of HF in later life is therefore an important public health aim, in the same way that reduction in acute MI and stroke is.

### Identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atrial fibrillation and chest pain with a contemporary sensitive troponin I assay [^113vTE8P]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnostic performance of these different absolute and relative changes in troponin I concentration within 3 hours alone and in combination with troponin I determined directly upon admission is presented in Tables 3 and 4. In patients with troponin I above the 99th percentile upon admission, application of the specificity-optimized 3-hour change threshold led to a PPV of 86% for either absolute change or relative change. In patients with troponin I levels above the specificity-optimized threshold upon admission, use of the specificity-optimized 3-hour change criterion yielded a PPV of 96% for absolute change and of 100% for relative change.

### Non-coronary predictors of elevated high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels in an unselected emergency patient cohort [^113trhaH]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Aim of this study was to evaluate the predictors of hs-cTnT in a non-ACS patient cohort admitted to the emergency department.

Hypothesis

Atrial fibrillation and hypertension may not always be sufficient for elevation for hs-cTnT.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single center study encompassing in total 1003 patients. Individuals were retrospectively divided in ACS- and non-ACS patients by two independent investigators reviewing the medical records. In order to identify predictors of hs-cTnT elevation hazard ratios were calculated for age, gender, vital signs, cardiovascular risk factors, LVEF, serum levels of CRP, hemoglobin, and creatinine. Elevation of hs-cTnT was defined by exceeding 14 ng/L (upper reference limit [URL]).

Results

About 987 patients were included while 25 patients were excluded because of missing data. 307 patients (31.4%) met the current guideline requirements of diagnosing an ACS, whereas 671 patients (68.6%) were hospitalized with excluded ACS. In the multivariate analysis age, anemia, CRP, creatinine, and reduced systolic left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of elevated troponin T levels in the non-ACS group. However, hypertensive systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia were not predictive for Troponin T elevation in non-ACS patients in this multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

In an unselected, non-ACS patient cohort age, chronic renal failure, inflammatory state, and reduced left ventricular systolic function were associated with hs-cTnT levels above the upper reference limit. Rather, often supposed predictors as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and tachycardia cannot sufficiently explain increased hs-cTnT in our study. Hence, further studies are needed to assess whether isolated hypertension, tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation sufficiently explain elevated hs-cTnT.

### Prognostic value of high-sensitive troponin T for predicting cardiovascular events after atrial fibrillation ablation [^1145MxvR]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the utility of high-sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT) for predicting AF recurrence and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after AF ablation.

Methods and Results

A total of 227 consecutive patients with AF (mean age, 66 ± 10 years; persistent AF, n = 98) who underwent an initial ablation were enrolled. We measured hs-TnT before AF ablation and divided the patients into three groups according to the hs-TnT level: low, lesser than or equal to 0.005µg/L (n = 54); medium, 0.006–0.013µg/L (n = 127); and high, greater than or equal to0.014µg/L (n = 46). We evaluated the composite endpoint of AF recurrence or MACE (including death, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure hospitalization) after the ablation. The median hs-TnT level was 0.008µg/L. The values of chronic kidney disease prevalence, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, B-type natriuretic peptide level, and left atrial diameter were the highest in the high hs-TnT group among the three groups. During a mean follow-up of 15 ± 8 months, AF recurrence and MACE occurred in 56 (25%) and 9 (4%) patients, respectively. The high hs-TnT group had the highest incidence of AF recurrence and MACE among the three groups (high: 39% and 15%, medium: 22% and 2%, and low: 19% and 0%, respectively; log-rank P < .05). In multivariate analysis, hs-TnT greater than or equal to 0.014µg/L and persistent AF were independent predictors of the composite endpoint.

Conclusion

Hs-TnT may be a useful marker for predicting AF recurrence or MACE after AF ablation.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^112SC3gd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac injury in the setting of COVID‐19 can lead to myocardial injury and rhythm disturbances, and the findings of both an elevated cardiac troponin and atrial arrhythmias on admission portends an ominous prognosis. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms of cardiovascular involvement in COVID‐19.

### Identifying survivors of sepsis at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes [^111LF3ar]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

For many years, infections have been recognized as precipitants of incident cardiovascular disease. Several epidemiologic studies have reported higher long-term risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and atrial fibrillation after viral illness, pneumonia, and sepsis. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of cardiovascular disease after sepsis remain incompletely understood, and point-of-care approaches to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from targeted interventions are appealing and much needed.

In this issue of the Journal, Garcia and colleagues (pp.) analyzed the association between serum troponin levels and 1-year cardiovascular events in a multicenter cohort of 14,046 adult survivors of sepsis hospitalization who had no prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Patients were categorized into three tertiles based on peak troponin levels measured within the first 14 days of hospital admission, and their association with a composite cardiovascular outcome of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (defined as acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization), acute heart failure, and atrial fibrillation was assessed. Among the 14,046 patients included in the primary analysis, 6,403 (45.6%) had an elevated troponin level. In unadjusted and multivariable analysis, elevated troponin levels were associated with a "dose-dependent" risk increase in incident cardiovascular events that ranged from 1.37-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2–1.55) for the lowest tertile to 1.77-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.56–2.00) in the highest tertile. These findings remained robust across multiple sensitivity analyses that included using only patients without missing data (i.e. complete cases), using different imputation strategies for missing data, using troponin as a continuous variable instead of a priori defined tertiles, and exclusion of cardiovascular events that occurred during hospitalization. In addition, the authors used eValues to assess the potential effect of unmeasured confounders. For example, the eValue for the association of peak troponin in the highest tertile and 1-year cardiovascular events was 2.94, indicating that residual confounding could explain the observed association only if there existed an unmeasured covariate with a relative risk association of at least 2.94.

Cohort Follow‐Up and End Point Assessment

The National Death Index was queried to determine participant mortality through 2019. Deaths were classified as cardiovascular if they included International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) codes I00‐I99. Nonfatal events were identified using 2 methods. First, a survey regarding interval cardiovascular events was administered to participants in annual calls. Second, for the > 90% of participants who provided consent, hospital admissions were identified via searching the Dallas‐Fort Worth Hospital Council Initiative Database. Primary clinical source documents were collected, and all cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded end point committee comprising cardiologists who reviewed all available information provided in the medical record. Outcomes including incident heart failure (HF), atherosclerotic CVD, and atrial fibrillation were adjudicated based on review of inpatient hospitalizations for these conditions.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^111QBJTi]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The change in biomarker measures over time may be more informative than a 1‐time measurement. We previously found in the ARIC study that change over time in concentrations of N‐terminal pro hormone B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) was associated with AF risk and improved the ability to predict AF. Also in the ARIC cohort, 6‐year change in hs‐cTnT was independently associated with all‐cause mortality, HF, and incident coronary heart disease (CHD). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, little is known about the impact of hs‐cTnT change on the risk of incident AF, as well as the role of hs‐cTnT change in upstream mechanism of developing incident AF. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the association between the change of hs‐cTnT and AF risk.

The ARIC study is a sizable predominantly bi‐racial cohort study in the general US population, with eight follow‐up visits to date. Its repeated measurements of hs‐cTnT in several follow‐ups, rigorously assessed AF endpoints, participant diversity, and long follow‐up provide a unique resource for exploring the role of change in circulating hs‐cTnT as a predictor of incident AF. Taking advantage of the longitudinal data in the ARIC study, we investigated the association of 6‐year change in circulating hs‐cTnT with the risk of incident AF, and determined the value of 6‐year change in hs‐cTnT in the prediction of AF.

### Detected troponin elevation is associated with high early mortality after lung resection for cancer [^115H8N8q]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Potential limitations

The main limiting factors are the retrospective study design on a relatively small group rendering our study susceptible to bias. Unfortunately, sample size was limited by the relatively recent introduction of troponin assay at our institution. We have assumed that atrial fibrillation was associated with myocardial necrosis as we have found no evidence to suggest that atrial fibrillation alone elevates serum troponin independently of myocardial necrosis. However, our findings are not altered in respect of this relationship. Although we were not able to adjust for preoperative lung function in our analyses, the mean preoperative FEV 1 of 2.2 l in patients in the troponin elevation arm was not different from our usual preoperative patient population.

Future directions

It is clear that serum troponin is rapidly becoming the cardiac marker of choice, and prospective studies on unselected patients will be able to more accurately establish its utility as a prognostic marker. Further work would be able to determine if elevated troponin levels result from procedures that involve the pericardium (intra pericardial pneumonectomies), and ascertain if it carries similar prognostic implication.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^113ij4M4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The heart is a unique organ, composed of myofibers, with its own conduction system. COVID‐19 can damage myocardium either through thrombosis leading to ischemia and infarction, or myocarditis through inflammation, but evidently it may also cause cardiac arrhythmias. As found in prior studies, 6, 14 we found a high rate of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 as defined by elevated hs‐cTnT. Additionally, we identified a wide range of abnormal ECG findings, including Q wave infarcts, atrial arrhythmias, ectopic beats, and ST and T wave changes, all of which were more commonly present in patients who experienced adverse outcomes. This study suggests that when COVID‐19 adversely affects both myocardium and cardiac conduction together, it is indicative of more profound cardiovascular involvement and is predictive of increased risk for death. Namely, the combination of elevated cardiac troponin and AF/AFL on ECG multivariable modeling was most significantly associated with increased mortality.

The associations between elevated troponin and AF/AFL with adverse outcomes have several possible explanations. First, direct COVID‐19 myocarditis may occur, and case studies have been published of patients with clinically diagnosed COVID‐19‐related myocarditis 15 or myopericarditis. 16 Secondly, the systemic coagulopathy that has been documented in severe COVID‐19 infection could lead to microvascular or epicardial coronary thrombosis. 17 Thirdly, COVID‐19 may result in a stress cardiomyopathy and cardiac injury from systemic inflammation, either as an isolated entity or accompanied by multi‐system organ failure with hypoxemia and shock. Finally, systemic inflammation can also lead to increased sympathetic activation, which may precipitate serious cardiac arrhythmias, such as AF/AFL. As some of these pathways may be targeted with specific therapies, such as anticoagulation or anti‐inflammatory therapy, determining underlying mechanisms remains critical. The pattern of ECG abnormalities may provide important clues to the underlying pathophysiology, such as diffuse ST elevations seen in myocarditis or focal changes that could indicate coronary thrombosis. During the initial phases of the pandemic, overwhelming patient volumes, scare resources, and concern for staff safety has limited the use of advanced cardiovascular imaging in patients with COVID‐19. As we move into the next phase of the pandemic, increased pathologic study by autopsy or endomyocardial biopsy could be combined with more widespread use of cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography to more fully delineate the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury and guide further study and treatment.

### High sensitivity cardiac troponin T and interleukin-6 predict adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^1167NhXn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are limited data on the prognostic role of biomarkers in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We evaluated the prognostic value of high sensitivity TnT (hsTnT) and high-sensitivity interleukin-6 (hsIL6) in a large cohort of AF patients taking oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) as both biomarkers have been associated with adverse cardiovascular events.

Methods

We studied 930 patients (51% male; median age 76) with permanent/ paroxysmal AF who were stabilized (for at least 6 months) on OAC (INRs 2.0–3.0). Plasma hsTnT and hsIL6 levels were quantified by electrochemiluminescense immunoassay at baseline. Patients were followed-up for up to 2 years, and adverse events (thrombotic and vascular events, mortality and major bleeding) were recorded.

Results

At follow-up, 96 patients (3.97%/year) died whilst 107 had an adverse cardiovascular event (3.14%/year). On multivariate analysis, high hsTnT and high hsIL6 remained significantly associated with prognosis even after adjusting for CHADS2 score: HR 2.21 (1.46–3.35, P < 0.001) for high hsTnT and 1.97 (1.29–3.02, P = 0.002) for high hsIL6, for adverse cardiovascular events. For all-cause mortality, the HRs were 1.79 (1.13–2.83, P = 0.013) and 2.48 (1.60–3.85, P < 0.001), respectively. The integrated discrimination index (IDI) values of clinical scores (CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2-VASc) were improved by the addition of hsTnT and/or hsIL6 (all P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In a large 'real world' cohort of anticoagulated AF patients, both hsTnT and hsIL6 levels provided prognostic information that was complementary to clinical risk scores for prediction of long-term cardiovascular events and death, suggesting that these biomarkers may potentially be used to refine clinical risk stratification in AF.

### Individual and joint associations of high-sensitivity troponin I and high-sensitivity troponin T with cardiac phenotypes and outcomes in the general population: an analysis from the Dallas heart study [^114nLTF9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Few prior cohort studies have evaluated differences in associations of hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT with risk factors, subclinical CVD phenotypes, and outcomes. Similar to what was observed in the present study, in a Scottish cohort, diabetes was associated with higher hs‐cTnT and higher BMI and lower HDL‐C was associated with hs‐cTnI. The observation that both troponin subtypes are independently associated with future events in community‐based cohorts is consistent with findings from the ARIC (Atherosis Risk in Communities) study, in which both assays were complementary for CVD risk assessment: participants with elevations in both hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT had the highest risk as compared with those with elevation in only 1 troponin subtype. In the ARISTOTLE (apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation) trial of patients with atrial fibrillation, prediction of cardiac death and myocardial infarction was improved when both hs‐cTnT and hs‐cTnI were used jointly. The complementary prognostic value for hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT likely reflects the nonredundant biological mechanisms contributing to chronic release, as highlighted by the findings of the present study.

Our study adds to the literature by including deeper phenotyping than prior studies to elucidate the associations between subclinical cardiac and metabolic phenotypes and the troponin biomarkers. We observed important differences in the associations between metabolic phenotypes and hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT. The positive associations of BMI with hs‐cTnI and the inverse association with HDL‐C and cholesterol efflux suggest unique metabolic determinants of hs‐cTnI release that are not present for hs‐cTnT. Additional study is needed to explore mechanisms that may explain these findings. In a previous study of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery versus intensive lifestyle modification, individuals who underwent surgery had a greater reduction in hs‐cTnI than hs‐cTnT levels, with reductions appearing to be mediated by reductions in body weight and triglycerides. It would be of particular interest to evaluate whether additional strategies that modify these metabolic parameters, such as weight‐loss medications or HDL mimetics, influence hs‐cTnI more than hs‐cTnT, and whether such changes associate favorably with HF risk.

### Cardiac vulnerability to cerebrogenic stress as a possible cause of troponin elevation in stroke [^114eEYhh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Suggested explanation of troponin elevation in acute stage of ischemic stroke. Troponin elevation may be synergistically induced by a combination of provocative cerebrogenic stress (eg, after insular cortical lesion [major or minor involvement; A and B] or severe stroke) and vulnerable heart (eg, hypertrophic or damaged myocardium).c‐prolongation may be a composite marker for reflecting both predisposed and newly provoked prolongation due to the underlying cardiac problems and provocative cerebrogenic stress.

Interestingly, the incidence of LAE and total AF was not different between patients with and without troponin elevation, otherwise the incidence of total AF was closely associated with the presence of LAE despite initial exclusion of patients with suspected heart failure (Figure 3 C). Recently, cardiac troponins have been known to be associated with incident AF in the general population, 26 and are associated with delayed diagnosis of AF after stroke. 27 However, it is still unclear whether the pathomechanism of troponin elevation in AF is due to AF itself (eg, accompanying tachycardia with a fast ventricular response) or due to pre‐existing heart failure with or without LAE. 28 Thus, our results could suggest that structural heart problems may play an important role in the identification of newly detected AF in stroke patients. Future studies are needed to clarify whether troponin elevation in AF is related to the structural heart problem or to AF itself in a large number of patients.

This study had several limitations. First, the design of the study was retrospective and the study was performed in a single center. Second, we were unable to perform intensive cardiac investigations for all stroke patients because these investigations were not routinely performed. Thus, in our study, there was still a remaining chance of including patients with undetected nonelevated ST elevation myocardial infarction or stress‐induced cardiomyopathy because we could only exclude patients showing definite evidence of acute coronary syndrome during their hospital stay. However, after adjusting for the potential confounder such as concomitant cardiac ischemia or infarction (eg, patients with Q‐wave or ST elevation), the impact of cardiac factors and neurologic factors on troponin elevation with synergistic interaction still existed. Third, the mechanism of troponin elevation and related ECG change is still somewhat unclear and tentative since troponin and ECG test results obtained from a single time point were used in our study. To overcome these problems, we are currently conducting a prospective trial with serial troponin and ECG tests in acute ischemic stroke patients (Clinical implications of elevated cardiac troponin‐I elevation in acute stroke patients; KCT0000682;).

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115jNz3e]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) perioperative outcomes — candidate endpoints for observational studies or clinical trials include pulmonary complications (acute respiratory failure, reintubation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, prolonged mechanical ventilation, desaturation), cardiac complications (arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction), biomarkers (troponin), and clinical outcomes (mortality, hospital length of stay, medical emergency team responses, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, health care costs, health care utilization). Postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiothoracic surgery is common even up to 30 days postoperatively, and approximately 9% of patients have asymptomatic troponin elevations after noncardiac surgery; increased postoperative troponins are associated with complications and 30-day mortality, supporting that troponin and other cardiac biomarkers may be useful intermediate outcomes perioperatively.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^115TpC8C]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Definition of incident atrial fibrillation

We determined AF cases in the ARIC study by three methods. First, during study exams, 12‐lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) data were obtained and transmitted electronically to the ARIC ECG reading center at EPICARE (Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston‐Salem, NC). The presence of AF or atrial flutter was identified in the ECG by a computer algorithm. To reduce the possibility of missing or misreading episodes of AF, a cardiologist would confirm the computer diagnosis and overread any rhythm disorder other than AF in ECG. Second, participants' hospitalization records including discharge codes were collected by follow‐up phone calls and surveillance of local hospitals. If the ICD‐9‐CM codes 427.31 (AF) or 427.32 (atrial flutter) or ICD‐10‐CM codes I48.x were identified in any given records, then AF was deemed as present. Any AF cases related to open cardiac surgery were excluded. Third, if death certificates listed ICD‐9 427.3 or ICD‐10 I48, then AF was regarded as present. These methods were described in detail in a published paper. Any participants who were diagnosed with AF through any of these methods was considered to have AF.

We conducted a study to examine the validity of AF ascertainment in ARIC. First, we reviewed hospital discharge records from 125 potential cases of AF based on ICD diagnosis codes, finding that the positive predictive value of these codes was approximately 90% (111 of 125 confirmed). Second, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of the ICD codes among ARIC participants undergoing surveillance for stroke — the corresponding values were 84% and 98%.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^117HFQ7s]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure — biomarkers in the definition emphasizes that natriuretic peptides, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone for brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are the most commonly used biomarker in heart failure (HF), yet despite high guideline support for diagnostic use they are largely absent from HF definitions; in contrast, myocardial infarction definitions centrally incorporate troponin. Access to natriuretic peptide testing is increasing and it is becoming part of standard care, but interpretation must be individualized because conditions such as chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, pericardial disease, pulmonary embolism, and aging can increase levels, and differences by race/ethnicity, sex, and age as well as atrial fibrillation–specific thresholds affect interpretation. In HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or obesity, levels can be lower than in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), complicating use. BNP and NT-proBNP generally track similarly and either can be used if their absolute values and cut points are not used interchangeably. BNP, but not NT-proBNP, is a neprilysin substrate, so angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor therapy may increase BNP but not NT-proBNP. Patient-level changes should be read against baseline because natriuretic peptides are higher during decompensation than during compensated periods, reflecting dynamic temporal changes.

### 6-year change in high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and the risk of atrial fibrillation in the atherosclerosis risk in communities cohort [^1114EDC8]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the observed association between changes in hs‐cTnT concentration and AF risk, this information did not increase the predictive ability of the CHARGE‐AF score, a well‐established model for the prediction of AF. This observation is in contrast with our previous analysis of the ARIC cohort focusing in NT‐proBNP changes, which described improvements in the C‐statistic for AF prediction after adding information on repeated NT‐proBNP measurements.

Our study has several strengths. First, the ARIC study recruited a large and diverse population. Second, we took advantage of the repeated measurements of hs‐cTnT in samples obtained several years apart. Third, in the ARIC study, we were able to adjust for other biomarkers, particularly NT‐proBNP. Our study also has some limitations. First, the study sample were limited to whites and African Americans who were recruited from four communities in the Unites States, which might not be generalizable to other populations. Second, we were not able to differentiate between AF patterns, such as paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, or permanent AF. Third, the method of AF ascertainment may have resulted in missing asymptomatic cases as well as those exclusively managed in outpatient settings. However, we have demonstrated adequate validity of our approach to case ascertainment and incidence rates of AF in the ARIC cohort are similar to those reported in other community‐based studies with more intensive methods for AF identification. Finally, as an observational study, there might be residual and unmeasured confounding that potentially could explain the association.

In conclusion, we have found that a 6‐year change in mid‐life hs‐cTnT concentrations were associated with risk of incident AF in a community‐based population. The association remains significant after adjusting for other established risk factors. Change in hs‐cTnT, however, did not contribute meaningfully to the prediction of AF. These results highlight the role that progression in myocardial injury could have in the development of the AF substrate, but do not support the use of repeated hs‐cTnT measures for prediction of AF. Further investigations regarding the association in other population are needed to verify and identify high‐risk individuals.

### Troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and incidence of stroke: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^116q7NJR]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Increased levels of plasma troponins and natriuretic peptides are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but only limited information exists on these biomarkers and stroke occurrence. In a prospective epidemiological study, we tested the hypothesis that high-sensitivity troponin T (TnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are associated positively with incidence of stroke.

Methods

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study measured plasma TnT and NT-proBNP in 10 902 men or women initially free of stroke and followed them for a mean of 11.3 years for stroke occurrence (n = 507).

Results

Both biomarkers were associated positively with total stroke, nonlacunar ischemic, and especially cardioembolic stroke, but not with lacunar or hemorrhagic stroke. For example, after adjustment for prevalent risk factors and cardiac diseases, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for jointly high values of TnT and NT-proBNP (versus neither biomarker high) were 2.70 (1.92–3.79) for total stroke and 6.26 (3.40–11.5) for cardioembolic stroke. Associations with stroke appeared somewhat stronger for NT-proBNP than TnT. Strikingly, ≈ 58% of cardioembolic strokes occurred in the highest quintile of prestroke NT-proBNP, and 32% of cardioembolic strokes occurred in participants who had both NT-proBNP in the highest quintile and were known by ARIC to have atrial fibrillation sometime before their cardioembolic stroke occurrence.

Conclusions

In the general population, elevated plasma TnT and NT-proBNP concentrations are associated with increased risk of cardioembolic and other nonlacunar ischemic strokes.

### Dyslipidemia and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation therapy: insights from the ARISTOTLE (apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation) trial [^112gGUhg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, mortality, and health costs worldwide. 1, 2 Biomarkers have shown increasing promise in improving risk prediction in AF. 3, 4 Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides and troponins, signifying myocardial damage and stress, have each shown to more than double the risk of stroke and all‐cause mortality. 5, 6 Other biomarkers, such as the marker for oxidative stress and inflammation, growth differentiation factor 15, have been reported to double the risk for major bleeding and death by approximately the same amount when elevated. 7 However, the predictive role of more‐traditional biomarkers, such as those that are components of dyslipidemia, is less clear.

Dyslipidemia is known to promote atherosclerosis. It is a complex disease and is a major risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. 8, 9, 10 High levels of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and low levels of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. 11, 12, 13 The relation between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular outcomes and its role as a risk factor in patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulation therapy have not been previously examined.

The aim of this substudy from the biomarker population of the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial was therefore to assess the association between the concentration of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), the main protein component of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) the main protein component of LDL, at baseline and clinical outcomes after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors as well as other relevant biomarkers that have shown prognostic value for adverse events in AF. 5, 6, 7, 14, 15

### Association between troponin levels and embolic stroke of undetermined source [^113MRPVL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Given the clinical and pathophysiological overlap of stroke and cardiovascular disease and the prognostic significance of cTn, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend evaluating cTn in every patient with an acute ischemic stroke. 3 Although cTn elevations are common in patients with acute ischemic stroke, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. 7, 8, 9, 24, 25 Our results suggest that patients with elevations in cTn but without clinically recognized acute ST‐segment elevation MI are more likely to have ESUS as opposed to those who have had noncardioembolic strokes. This association remained significant even after stroke severity and insular involvement have been taken into consideration, when only patients with a dynamic change in cTn levels are considered, when patients with atrial fibrillation discovered on follow‐up prolonged rhythm monitoring have been excluded, and after accounting for baseline antithrombotic use.

Elevations in cTn may occur in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have concomitant acute plaque rupture causing myocardial ischemia. However, in the TRELAS (Troponin Elevation in Acute Ischemic Stroke) study, only 7/29 (24%) of patients with acute ischemic stroke with elevations in cTn were thought to have a culprit coronary lesion (the majority of which were asymptomatic), suggesting that there may be alternative mechanisms of cTn elevations in patients with acute ischemic stroke. 26 In the absence of a clinically apparent MI, tachyarrhythmia or nonischemic myocardial injury such as neurogenic stunned myocardium (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) can also result in cTn elevations. 5, 27, 28 Neurogenic stunned myocardium may lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and cTn release through alterations in the neural outflow to the heart. 29 The insular cortex is believed to play a role in orchestrating central autonomic control, and there is some evidence that injury to the insular cortex may be associated with elevated circulating catecholamines leading to both stunned myocardium and elevated cTn levels. 19, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31 Finally, chronic, stable conditions associated with elevated cTn such as congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease may all lead to asymptomatic cTn elevations. 9 Even when these potential confounders were controlled for, an elevated cTn remained associated with ESUS.

### Prognostic implications of troponin I elevation in emergency department patients with tachyarrhythmia [^116rENUH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because in our study, the adverse prognosis of patients with elevated cTnI levels was determined on an all‐cause basis and not by readmission rates for cardiovascular causes, we consider that the performance of ischemia detection studies should be established individually, according to the pre‐test probability of ischemic heart disease and the clinical characteristics of the acute episode. An important potential practical implication of our observations is the expectation of elevated cTnI levels among one‐third of patients admitted to the ED with tachyarrhythmias. Thus, our findings suggest that cTnI assessment in these patients could be a useful tool for long‐term mortality risk prediction, in parallel to a clinical assessment of conventional risk factors. To date, no interventions have been described that are capable of modifying the adverse prognosis in this population. Hence, close monitoring seems to be the most reasonable therapeutic strategy.

4.1 Limitations

This study has certain limitations. First, cTnI testing in the ED was left to the decision of the treating physician, who may not have measured cTnI in patients with a lower risk perception, such as younger adults with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. This decision could represent a selection bias. Despite this limitation, the study reflects the real‐life clinical scenario in the ED. Second, as it was a retrospective study, the evaluation of coronary heart disease was not performed in all patients with elevated cTnI; hence, we cannot draw conclusions on this aspect. However, in the short‐ and long‐term follow‐up, we did not observe readmission for MI or HF. This result strongly suggests that elevated cTnI levels do not correlate closely with the burden of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Third, the study did not aim to identify the mechanism by which elevated cTnI levels predict cardiovascular risk in the context of tachyarrhythmia.

### Common causes of troponin elevations in the absence of acute myocardial infarction: incidence and clinical significance [^113MDYnL]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin is a preferred biomarker of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Unfortunately, elevation of troponin can be detected in a variety of conditions other than acute MI. This review focuses on the incidence and clinical significance of increased troponin in conditions commonly associated with troponin elevations, particularly in those that may resemble acute MI.

Relationship Between the Preprocedural hs‐TnT Level and Echocardiographic Parameters

The preprocedural hs‐TnT level was not correlated with the preprocedural LVEF (r = −0.097; P = 0.55), left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter (r = 0.11; P = 0.49), or LVDs (r = 0.16; P = 0.32). A weak positive correlation was found in the preprocedural hs‐TnT level and preprocedural LAD (r = 0.37; P = 0.02).

The preprocedural hs‐TnT level was not correlated with the changes in the left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter (r = 0.068; P = 0.68) or LAD (r = 0.12; P = 0.47) from the baseline to the late phase after the ablation (Figure 3). However, it significantly correlated with from the changes in the LVEF (ΔLVEF; r = −0.47; P = 0.002) and LVDs (ΔLVDs; r = 0.37; P = 0.02) from baseline to the late phase after the ablation (Figure 3).

Long‐Term Outcome After the Ablation

During a mean follow‐up of 20.3 ± 14.1 months, a total of 8 (20%) patients including 5 (50%) nonresponders and 3 (10%) responders (P = 0.01), experienced recurrent AF. None of the responders were hospitalized due to heart failure. However, 2 nonresponders experienced hospitalizations attributable to heart failure. Both patients had recurrent AF, and the preprocedural hs‐TnT levels exceeded the cutoff value of 12 pg/mL (30 and 36 pg/mL). No patients had any thromboembolic events or death during a long‐term follow‐up period.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was 30‐day all‐cause in‐hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias were defined as atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias were defined as frequent premature ventricular contractions, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Arrhythmias were identified by review of all ECGs and telemetry strips during hospitalization. ECG, telemetry findings, and complication events were reviewed and adjudicated by study investigators (KM, BP, XY, JK, and JWC). Disagreements on adjudication were resolved by consensus.

### Repeated measurements of cardiac biomarkers in atrial fibrillation and validation of the ABC stroke score over time [^117PpWKH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac biomarkers are independent risk markers in atrial fibrillation, and the novel biomarker-based ABC stroke score (age, biomarkers, and clinical history of prior stroke) was recently shown to improve the prediction of stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our aim was to investigate the short-term variability of the cardiac biomarkers and evaluate whether the ABC stroke risk score provides a stable short-term risk estimate.

Methods and Results

According to the study protocol, samples were obtained at entry and also at 2 months in 4796 patients with atrial fibrillation followed for a median of 1.8 years in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Cardiac troponin I, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were measured with high-sensitivity immunoassays. Associations with outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression. C indices and calibration plots were used to evaluate the ABC stroke score at 2 months. The average changes in biomarker levels during 2 months were small (median change cardiac troponin T +2.8%, troponin I +2.0%, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide +13.5%) and within-subject correlation was high (all ≥ 0.82). Repeated measurement of cardiac biomarkers provided some incremental prognostic value for mortality but not for stroke when combined with clinical risk factors and baseline levels of the biomarkers. Based on 8702 person-years of follow-up and 96 stroke/systemic embolic events, the ABC stroke score at 2 months achieved a similar C index of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65–0.76) as compared with 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65–0.75) at baseline. The ABC stroke score remained well calibrated using predefined risk classes.

Conclusions

In patients with stable atrial fibrillation, the variability of the cardiac biomarkers and the biomarker-based ABC stroke score during 2 months are small. The prognostic information by the ABC stroke score remains consistent and well calibrated with similar good predictive performance if patients are retested after 2 months.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels and risk of cerebral microbleeds in acute ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation and / or rheumatic heart disease [^113xMBsS]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels are associated with coronary disease and small-vessel ischemic stroke through their associations with atherosclerosis. Considering the relationship between atherosclerosis and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), the purpose of this study was to examine associations between serum hs-cTnT levels and risk of CMBs in acute ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

This prospective study involved consecutively recruited acute ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation and/or rheumatic heart disease treated at a large tertiary care hospital in southwestern China. Clinico-demographic data were collected and analyzed by logistic regression to identify the relationship between serum hs-cTnT levels and CMB occurrence and location.

Results

In the final analysis, of 66 patients (27 males; mean age, 68.7years), 39 (59.1%) had CMBs. Hs-cTnT levels were not associated with risk of strictly lobar CMBs. However, after adjusting age, sex, current alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior antithrombotic therapy and NIHSS on admission, patients in the higher tertile were more likely to have CMBs and deep or infratentorial CMBs (P < 0.05) compared with the lower hs-cTnT tertile.

Conclusion

Hs-cTnT may be an independent predictor for the occurrence of CMBs, particularly of deep or infratentorial CMBs. This finding justifies further research into how hs-cTnT levels may contribute to CMBs and potentially other subclinical small-vessel diseases.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^116cGPa8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Cardiovascular involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and leads to worsened mortality. Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64 ± 17 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST-T wave changes, and initial hs-cTnT ≥ 20 ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs-cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Myocardial injury with hs-cTnT ≥ 20 ng/L, in addition to cardiac conduction perturbations, especially AF/AFL, upon hospital admission for COVID-19 infection is associated with markedly increased risk for mortality than either diagnostic abnormality alone.

### Heart rate and troponin level in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^113dW5n8]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac troponins are routinely used to rule in or rule out acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Among patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, mildly elevated troponin levels are common but rarely caused by type 1 myocardial infarction. 1 We aimed to investigate the association of heart rate with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels in patients admitted to the ED for AF. The Tropo-AF study1 aimed to investigate the factors associated with minor hs-cTn T elevations in 2911 patients with AF at the ED; 501 patients from the Tropo-AF study fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this cohort study: at least 2 hs-cTn T samples within 72 hours and principal discharge diagnosis of AF. A total of 501 patients were included in analysis.

In multiple linear regression analysis, increase in peak hs-cTn T level was independently associated with a higher heart rate. This cohort study found that high ventricular heart rate was significantly associated with troponin release in patients admitted to the ED primarily for symptomatic AF. The association of heart rate with hs-cTn T release was nonlinear and became evident above the heart rate threshold of 125 bpm. Persistent mild elevation of troponin levels is a common finding in AF, but the underlying etiopathogenesis remains unclear. 1, 2 Old age and multiple comorbidities were associated with minor troponin elevations in patients with AF independent of heart rate. This study's findings suggest that inadequate ventricular rate control in the acute setting was associated with increased troponin T levels.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, small sample size, and determination of heart rate from single admission electrocardiogram. Nevertheless, these results suggest that high ventricular heart rate at admission was independently associated with troponin release in patients with AF. The effect of ventricular heart rate should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of patients with AF and increased troponin levels.

### High-sensitivity vs conventional troponin cutoffs for risk… [^112Ct1AN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the association between using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I instead of conventional cTnI and outcomes of patients with pulmonary embolism. Findings In this cohort study of 834 patients with hemodynamically stable PE, hs-cTnI, compared with cTnI, more frequently detected elevated values, but failed to predict the 30-day risk of a complicated course. Conclusions and Relevance In this study of patients with hemodynamically stable PE, hs-cTnI identified modest elevations in cardiac troponin levels. However, the results did not provide additive clinical value compared with cTnI. These findings suggest that use of hs-cTnI may result in overestimation of the risk in patients with stable PE. Several studies have shown a consistent increase in the risk of cardiovascular events and death with elevated hs-cTn in ambulatory patients, those with chest pain, or patients with heart failure.

1 In some patient populations, including those with chest pain, hs-cTn has shown excellent performance for timely assessment and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and that patients with positive hs-cTn but negative cTn have a higher risk of adverse events, such as MI and death. As such, hs-cTn tests have supplanted regular troponin tests in many clinical settings. 2, 3. Using cTnI, 139 patients had a positive troponin test result. In contrast, using hs-cTnI, 264 had a positive test result. A complicated course was observed in 62 patients. Analyzing cTn elevation as a binary variable, cTnI was predictive of a complicated course. Echocardiographic assessment identified RV dysfunction in 191 patients.

Using cTnI to determine a positive troponin value, the proportion of patients designated as low risk, intermediate-low risk, and intermediate-high risk were 29. 6%,
63. 5%, and 6. 8%.
