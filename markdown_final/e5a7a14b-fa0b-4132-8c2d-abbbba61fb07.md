## Question

A 3-year-old with cellulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management plan for cellulitis in a 3-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ruling out mimics. Then, I should verify severity and decide on care setting. Next, I will select empiric antibiotics tailored to purulent versus nonpurulent presentations and special anatomic sites, confirm route of administration, and set duration. After that, I should review supportive care and follow-up milestones, anticipate when to escalate or reconsider the diagnosis, and integrate special scenarios such as water exposure, infants, and immunocompromise. Finally, I need to ensure documentation, caregiver education, and system-level quality considerations are addressed, while continuously self-checking against guidelines and key studies throughout this reasoning process [^115fTU2J] [^1119mx9Q].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with substantial misdiagnosis rates and no gold standard test, and mislabeling pseudocellulitis leads to unnecessary antibiotics and admissions; I should pay close attention to timing, local warmth, expanding erythema with ill-defined borders, tenderness, and whether there is purulence or fluctuance suggesting an abscess, while also considering mimics such as contact dermatitis, insect-bite reactions, venous stasis, gout, DVT, and eosinophilic cellulitis, especially since meta-analytic data suggest misdiagnosis around 41% in some settings, so I should double-check by ultrasound if uncertain and avoid routine blood and skin cultures in uncomplicated cases, and remember to examine interdigital toe spaces for fissuring or tinea pedis as portals of entry in lower-extremity disease [^111Gmbbk] [^1119mx9Q] [^112Y49h4] [^111Mrdn1] [^114vUVFq].

> Hold on, I should verify severity and disposition next because that determines route and monitoring; per IDSA and AAFP, I should admit if there is concern for deeper or necrotizing infection, SIRS or sepsis, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, severe immunocompromise, anticipated poor adherence, failure of outpatient therapy, inability to tolerate oral agents, or surgical indications, whereas a well-appearing 3-year-old without these red flags is typically appropriate for outpatient oral therapy with close follow-up, and I must remember that infants under 3 months require hospitalization for a full sepsis evaluation given the risk of GBS bacteremia and meningitis [^112iZpuV] [^115UecZb] [^111ek3cL] [^113ZeEw7].

> Let me think about empiric therapy for nonpurulent cellulitis first; the most likely pathogens are β-hemolytic streptococci and MSSA, so cephalexin 50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours is an appropriate first-line oral option with typical courses demonstrating good outcomes in pediatrics, and I should avoid routine initial MRSA coverage in uncomplicated nonpurulent cases, as recommended by IDSA and supported by reviews, reserving MRSA-active therapy for nonresponse or specific risk factors, though I should confirm local susceptibilities and individual risk elements before finalizing the plan [^1119mx9Q] [^1125vnm1] [^112AAE7s].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered giving universal MRSA coverage because a small needle aspiration series isolated only MRSA and suggested empiric MRSA coverage for cellulitis, but hold on, I should verify the weight of evidence; that study had a very low yield and is not practice-changing, and guideline-concordant care in nonpurulent cellulitis emphasizes streptococcal coverage first, with escalation to MRSA-active therapy only if there is purulence, high local MRSA prevalence, or clinical nonresponse, so I will correct course and not over-treat with MRSA agents initially in a straightforward nonpurulent presentation [^111CZ8WV] [^1125vnm1] [^1119mx9Q].

> I will now examine the purulent pathway or abscess scenario, since that changes management; for purulent cellulitis or abscess, I should ensure incision and drainage when indicated and add MRSA coverage in children with clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours or TMP-SMX based on 8–12 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 12 hours, checking local clindamycin resistance and the child's allergy profile, while reserving vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for severe or hospitalized cases, and I should add adjunctive antibiotics to I&D when systemic signs are present per IDSA [^1118k8ze] [^114zdKRg] [^111tWNDR].

> Next, I should review special anatomic sites, and I need to ensure I do not miss periorbital versus orbital involvement; in suspected orbital disease I should admit for IV therapy such as ceftriaxone or cefazolin, add MRSA coverage if risk suggests it, obtain urgent ophthalmology consultation, and use imaging to distinguish preseptal from postseptal disease, recognizing real-world variation in imaging and steroid use and the lack of clear benefit from steroids in observational analyses, while noting ambulatory IV pathways for preseptal cases can be safe with careful selection and daily review [^113KXkHu] [^111onPsh] [^112X68Tp] [^117KqU2Z].

> I need to ensure the route of administration aligns with severity and reliability; for a stable child tolerating oral intake and without systemic toxicity, oral antibiotics are preferred, whereas IV therapy is indicated for moderate to severe infection with systemic signs, failed oral therapy, or periorbital/orbital involvement, and when IV therapy is needed but hospitalization can be avoided, once-daily ceftriaxone via home programs is noninferior to inpatient flucloxacillin in selected children, provided reliable caregivers and appropriate nursing support are in place [^113MYgPs] [^1164f7aQ] [^111ek3cL].

> Let me consider supportive care because it improves outcomes and reassessment; I should elevate the affected limb to reduce edema, apply warm compresses for comfort, provide appropriate analgesia, and mark the erythema borders to track progression, and I should confirm and treat predisposing factors such as interdigital tinea pedis or eczema to reduce recurrence risk, as emphasized by IDSA [^115fTU2J] [^117WMmEy] [^111Mrdn1].

> I should confirm the duration next; uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis in a child typically requires 5–6 days of active streptococcal coverage with extension only if clinical response is slower, while complicated or purulent cases, orbital involvement, or immunocompromise often merit 7–14 days individualized to response, and I need to avoid reflexively long courses without indication [^111gsSaf] [^115fTU2J] [^114ge6ZK].

> I will now examine early follow-up expectations and triggers for reassessment; I should re-evaluate at 24–48 hours expecting less tenderness and some decrease in warmth and erythema, but I should not overinterpret day-1 nonresponse because early escalation is common yet not necessarily linked to inappropriate initial therapy, while nonresponse by day 3 is more predictive of a complicated course and should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis, POCUS to rule out occult abscess, and antibiotic adjustment including MRSA coverage if not already present, particularly in the presence of risk factors for outpatient failure [^117Pd3mv] [^115ZLcDr] [^1175UPek] [^114vUVFq].

> But wait, what if there is water exposure or unusual pathogens, or the child is very young or immunocompromised; after checking, in pediatric Vibrio vulnificus wound infections, the CDC recommends TMP-SMX plus an aminoglycoside and to avoid doxycycline and fluoroquinolones in children, whereas IDSA allows doxycycline plus a third-generation cephalosporin in life-threatening situations, so I should reconcile this by prioritizing CDC pediatric guidance for non-life-threatening cases and reserving doxycycline-based regimens for life-threatening scenarios after specialist input, and I should hospitalize immunocompromised patients with broad empiric coverage when severe, and remember that infants under 3 months warrant full sepsis evaluation due to GBS risk [^113iffKH] [^115vqqrL] [^115uKspM] [^113ZeEw7].

> Next, I should review prevention for recurrent cases; if a child experiences three to four episodes per year despite addressing portals of entry and skin conditions, I should consider prophylactic oral penicillin or erythromycin for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, and for recurrent MRSA, decolonization with mupirocin nasal ointment with or without chlorhexidine or dilute bleach baths can be considered along with hygiene reinforcement [^115ssoEa] [^111J8tTJ] [^112bNNbj].

> I need to ensure documentation and caregiver education are thorough; I should record measurements of erythema, systemic signs, antibiotic choice with rationale, and a clear follow-up plan, and I should counsel caregivers on signs of progression, adherence to the short-course plan, the expectation of early improvement by 48–72 hours, and when to return urgently, reinforcing that 5–6 days is sufficient for uncomplicated cases with good follow-up [^111gsSaf] [^1119mx9Q].

> Hold on, I should verify system-level quality considerations to minimize overtreatment and resource use; implementing pathways that avoid unnecessary MRSA coverage in simple cellulitis and emphasizing ultrasound to distinguish abscess from cellulitis can reduce broad-spectrum use without increasing revisits, while early dermatology consultation can decrease misdiagnosis though randomized data show no reduction in length of stay, reminding me to use consults to refine diagnosis rather than to expect shorter admissions [^112REywX] [^114vUVFq] [^1114XDHs] [^112bQrDj].

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old is a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue [^1119mx9Q], most often due to **β-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus** [^113L84Tc]. Management is guided by severity: **oral cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate** for mild cases, and **IV cefazolin or clindamycin** for severe or MRSA-suspected cases [^112AAE7s] [^112cLfcS] [^1118k8ze] [^114LP8SG]. Hospitalize if there are **systemic signs**, **rapid progression**, **immunocompromise**, or **failure of outpatient therapy** [^115UecZb]. Most children improve within 48–72 hours [^117Pd3mv]; monitor for complications such as abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, or bacteremia [^112cLfcS], and address predisposing factors to reduce recurrence [^115fTU2J].

---

## Clinical presentation

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Erythema**: Localized redness of the skin, often with ill-defined borders [^1119mx9Q].

- **Edema**: Swelling of the affected area.

- **Warmth**: Increased temperature of the involved skin.

- **Tenderness**: Pain or discomfort upon palpation [^113L84Tc].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, irritability, and occasionally lymphadenopathy [^117Sz9yf].

Common sites of cellulitis in this age group include the **lower extremities**, **face**, and **periorbital region**.

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The **most common causative organisms** in pediatric cellulitis are β-hemolytic streptococci — particularly group A streptococcus (GAS) — and Staphylococcus aureus [^1119mx9Q], including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [^117Sz9yf]. Risk factors include skin trauma (minor cuts, abrasions, insect or animal bites), pre-existing skin conditions (eczema, impetigo, varicella), immunocompromised states due to chronic illnesses or immunosuppressive therapy, and poor hygiene or inadequate skin care [^115fTU2J].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Cellulitis is primarily a **clinical diagnosis** based on history and physical examination, with testing reserved for severe disease or suspected systemic involvement [^112cLfcS]. Laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, ESR) may aid assessment in severe cases, and blood cultures are recommended in severe presentations, immunocompromised patients, or when bacteremia is suspected [^112Y49h4]. Ultrasound or MRI is indicated if abscess formation, deep tissue involvement, or osteomyelitis is suspected [^111JTWYe] [^114vUVFq].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can **mimic cellulitis** in pediatric patients, including:

- **Erysipelas**: Superficial bacterial infection with well-defined borders [^114kM2k4].

- **Abscess**: Localized collection of pus [^114vUVFq].

- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection [^112cLfcS].

- **Allergic reactions**: Angioedema or urticaria [^113JQWLj].

- **Deep vein thrombosis**: Rare in children but should be considered [^114kM2k4].

---

## Management and treatment

Management of cellulitis in a 3-year-old **depends on severity** and on the presence of systemic symptoms:

### Mild cases (no systemic symptoms)

- **Oral antibiotics**: Cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate are first-line agents [^112cLfcS].

- **MRSA coverage**: Clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) if MRSA is suspected [^1166kUD4].

- **Supportive care**: Elevation of the affected limb, analgesics, and antipyretics [^117WMmEy].

---

### Moderate to severe cases (systemic symptoms or rapid progression)

- **Intravenous antibiotics**: Cefazolin or clindamycin are recommended initial empiric therapy [^1118k8ze] [^114LP8SG].

- **MRSA coverage**: Vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA is suspected or confirmed [^111hF6M3] [^1116N4gR].

- **Hospitalization**: Indicated for severe infections, immunocompromised patients, or failure of outpatient therapy [^111ek3cL] [^115UecZb].

---

## Complications

Potential **complications** of cellulitis in pediatric patients include abscess formation requiring drainage, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis; recurrence is also possible [^112cLfcS].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old is a common bacterial skin infection. Prompt **clinical diagnosis** and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential, and the prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most children improving within 48–72 hours of treatment initiation [^1119mx9Q]. Recurrence is common, particularly in children with underlying skin conditions or immunocompromised states, and preventive measures — including proper skin care, hygiene, and management of underlying conditions — are essential to reduce recurrence risk [^115fTU2J].

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin allows pathogens to enter the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, with the highest risk of treatment failure observed in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% of cases within 1 year and 45% within 3 years.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly in determining the setting of care, the AAFP 2015 guidelines recommend hospitalizing patients with any of the following:

- **Uncontrolled SSTI**: Despite adequate oral antibiotic therapy.
- **Inability to tolerate oral antibiotics**: Due to patient-specific factors.
- **Indications for surgery**: When surgical intervention is necessary.
- **Initial severe or complicated SSTI**: Requiring immediate intervention.
- **Underlying unstable comorbidity or signs of sepsis**: Indicating a higher risk of complications.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^1118k8ze]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

The IDSA 2011 guidelines specifically address the treatment of cellulitis in pediatric patients. It is recommended to administer clindamycin intravenously at a dose of 10–13 mg/kg every 6–8 hours, totaling 40 mg/kg per day. Transition to oral therapy is suggested if the strain is susceptible and the patient is stable without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection. This treatment option is advisable only if the clindamycin resistance rate is low, specifically below 10%.

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^112AAE7s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

To determine antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center, as well as the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment, a descriptive case-control study was conducted.

The setting was a tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center. Medical records of otherwise healthy children aged 1–16 years presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001 - December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and microbiology results, management (including choice, dose, and route of antibiotics), treatment failures, and time spent in the ED.

Interventions were not applied during the study. The main results included the selection of 269 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105), with a treatment failure occurrence in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). In the cefazolin-only group, 12 (31%) experienced treatment failures, whereas in the cefazolin and probenecid group, 7 (8.1%) experienced treatment failures. The intravenous group experienced more time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) compared to the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112iZpuV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, specifically in the context of care settings, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend hospitalizing patients who meet any of the following criteria:

- **Concerns for a deeper or necrotizing infection**: This condition requires immediate and intensive medical intervention.

- **Poor adherence to therapy**: Hospitalization may ensure proper administration of treatments for these individuals.

- **Severe immunocompromised conditions**: Patients with severe immunosuppression are at a higher risk of complications and should be closely monitored within a hospital setting.

- **Failure of outpatient treatment**: If initial outpatient therapies do not succeed, hospital admission may be necessary for more intensive care.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^117Pd3mv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. Additionally, the study examined early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity, as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By focusing on cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study could assess early response in relation to baseline factors largely without the influence of confounders such as the need for surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for assessing early response and how initial response can inform continued treatment and predict outcomes.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^113iffKH]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

For cellulitis, particularly in patients with Vibrio vulnificus infection, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend administering TMP/SMX plus an aminoglycoside to pediatric patients with Vibrio vulnificus wound infections. The use of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones should be avoided.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111rjLNJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

We found no robustly developed and validated diagnostic tools or criteria for lower-limb cellulitis. A variety of potential tools have been explored so far, including biochemical tests, imaging, predictive scoring, and clinical features. However, in seven of the eight included studies, cellulitis was not the main pathology of interest and was used as a comparator. Three studies compared cellulitis with rare differential diagnoses, such as osteomyelitis, which provide limited clinical applicability. This diversity in the tools explored emphasizes the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis on first presentation.

All eight included studies identified in this review were observational studies. The sample sizes were small, with only two studies including more than 100 patients with cellulitis. No criteria or tools have been subsequently validated in a large prospective study.

Despite cellulitis being a common presentation in community settings, all the tools identified at the time of writing have been developed and tested in secondary care, with limited evidence of validity or applicability in community settings. No study stated that the gold standard reference for clinical diagnosis was a board-certified dermatologist or other specialist with cellulitis expertise. Only one study clearly stated who made the cellulitis diagnosis.

All the tools developed at the time of writing can be accessed by secondary care, are already available, and, with the exception of CT imaging, are inexpensive. The severity of cellulitis is likely to be worse in secondary care. However, none of these tools have been validated extensively for broad clinical use.

### Ultrasound soft-tissue applications in the pediatric emergency department: To drain or not to drain [^111JTWYe]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Soft tissue infections frequently prompt visits to the pediatric emergency department. The incidence of these infections has increased markedly in recent years. The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with increasing morbidity, mortality, and frequency of abscess formation. Bedside ultrasound may have a significant impact on managing patients who present to the pediatric emergency department with soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscess, peritonsillar abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis.

Ultrasound is an efficient, noninvasive diagnostic tool which can augment the physician's clinical examination. It has been shown to be superior to clinical judgment alone in determining the presence or absence of occult abscess formation, ensuring appropriate management and limiting unnecessary invasive procedures.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, leading to the potential for incorrect treatment, avoidable hospital admission, and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review using Ovid and Embase databases in May 2018. The aim was to describe diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis. We assessed the quality of identified studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and included all types of studies that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

- **Results**: Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging, and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data were low and results could not be pooled due to the heterogeneity of the findings.

- **Conclusions**: There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is known to be challenging. Approximately one in three patients admitted with suspected lower-limb cellulitis is misdiagnosed.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department. However, there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus being most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases. Point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, while treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113HJYLn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence synthesis and risk of bias assessment: All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate methodological quality, two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) assessed all studies using signaling questions from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.-T.). If information was not clearly provided in the study, the reviewers assessed the signaling question as 'unclear'.

For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signaling questions were answered 'yes'; 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signaling question was 'no'; or 'unclear' in all other cases.

### Misdiagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Gmbbk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with several mimics and no gold standard diagnostic criteria. Misdiagnosis is common. This review aims to quantify the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings based on a second clinical assessment and describe the proportion and types of alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL) using MeSH and other subject terms identified 887 randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and cohort studies. Included articles assessed the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings through a second clinical assessment up to 14 days post initial diagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis. Studies on infants and patients with (peri-)orbital, purulent, and severe or complex cellulitis were excluded. Screening and data extraction were conducted independently in pairs. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified risk of bias tool from Hoy et al. Meta-analyses were undertaken where ≥ 3 studies reported the same outcome.

- **Results**: Nine studies conducted in the United States, UK, and Canada, including a total of 1600 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Six studies were conducted in the inpatient setting; three were in outpatient clinics. All nine included studies provided estimates of the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis, with a range from 19 to 83%. The mean proportion misdiagnosed was 41% (95% CI 28 to 56% for random effects model). Heterogeneity between studies was very high both statistically (I² 96%, p-value for heterogeneity).

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial healthcare spending.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, in the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day postdischarge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended antibiot

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: Best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^111gsSaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy duration, the ACP 2021 guidelines recommend completing a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci in patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. This is particularly advised for patients who are able to self-monitor and have close follow-up with primary care.

### Distinguishing clinical features for pseudocellulitis in pediatric inpatients: A retrospective study [^115V4wPz]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical features of 588 pediatric inpatients admitted with a diagnosis of cellulitis were reviewed, with attention to the diagnostic accuracy of true cellulitis (95.1%) versus pseudocellulitis (4.9%) and the utilization of specialist consultations (28.1% infectious disease, 6.1% dermatology). Laboratory abnormalities were unable to distinguish cellulitis from pseudocellulitis, supporting previous studies that suggest routine laboratory evaluation may be unnecessary for this diagnosis. Higher rates of pseudocellulitis were identified in cases involving specialist consultation by both dermatology (44.8% pseudocellulitis, 4.1% true cellulitis, p < .001) and infectious disease (48.3% pseudocellulitis, 27.0% true cellulitis, p = .01). Thus, consultation may improve the diagnostic accuracy of suspected cellulitis among pediatric inpatients.

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. However, it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain is typical.

However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant healthcare costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as in appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making to tailor treatment effectively for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Management of children with uncomplicated cellulitis in emergency and hospital settings [^117MPATh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to establish consensus recommendations on features used to determine the route of antibiotic administration and disposition for children with uncomplicated cellulitis. Modified Delphi methodology was performed with two rounds of confidential surveys involving emergency medicine and hospital medicine (HM) providers at Lurie Children's Hospital to assess cellulitis management in children aged 6 months to 18 years without signs of sepsis or abscess formation.

Using a 9-point Likert scale, emergency medicine providers ranked features by perceived level of importance when deciding the initial antibiotic route, while HM providers ranked features on importance when transitioning to oral antibiotics. Responses were categorized as not important (1–3), neutral (4–6), and important (7–9), and were re-evaluated in the second round to reach a consensus, defined as at least 70% agreement.

Emergency medicine providers (n = 17) reached consensus on 15 of 16 features (93.8%), with 10 deemed important. Participants achieved the greatest consensus (100%) on considerations for initiating intravenous antibiotics, including fevers/chills, lymphangitis, and functional impairment. HM providers (n = 15) reached consensus on 9 of 11 factors (81.8%), with 7 considered important when deciding on readiness for oral antibiotics. Providers indicated that stability, rather than reduction, of erythematous margins is sufficient to consider transition and de-escalation of therapy at less than 24 hours if all other clinical improvement criteria are met.

### Cellulitis: definition, etiology, and clinical features [^113L84Tc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common condition encountered by physicians. Over the past decade, skin and soft tissue infections caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have become increasingly prevalent. In this article, the definition, etiology, and clinical features of cellulitis are reviewed, with an emphasis on differentiating cellulitis from necrotizing soft tissue infections. Empiric antimicrobial recommendations are provided, including the most recent guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America.

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^114kM2k4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. Mimics of cellulitis, presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain, can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

- **Objective**: This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, its mimics, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

- **Discussion**: The emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in a similar manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

- **Conclusion**: Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician in accurately identifying these conditions.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): A single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^113MYgPs]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure…

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115ZLcDr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment escalation was observed in 34% (69/205) of cases, mostly within 2 days of treatment initiation. Among cases with such early escalation, 90% (37/41) had nonresponse at day 1. Most cases with nonresponse at day 1 and treatment escalation within day 2 had responded by day 3 but not as often as those without escalation (73% [24/33] vs. 91% [75/82]; p = 0.009). Treatment escalation within day 2 was rarely associated with inappropriate initial therapy (2/40 [5%]) and was common both in cases with confirmed or probable BHS etiology (32/173 [19%]) and other cases (8/39 [27%]). Long duration of therapy was strongly associated with nonresponse at day 3, but not with nonresponse at day 1. Surgical treatment escalation was clearly more common in cases with nonresponse at day 3.

- **Treatment resources and outcome in relation to response at days 1 and 3**: Nonresponse at day 1 and day 3 was not significantly associated with clinical failure, but nonresponse at day 3 was predictive of a complicated, resource-demanding course. Sensitivity analysis with replacement of missing response data gave similar results.

### Needle aspiration for the etiologic diagnosis of children with cellulitis in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111CZ8WV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem in children, but determining the causative agent is challenging. One tool used to identify the etiology is needle aspiration. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of needle aspiration in pediatric patients with cellulitis in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

- **Methods**: This was a prospective descriptive study conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital. A convenience sample of healthy children, aged 0 to 18 years, with cellulitis were enrolled. A standard cellulitis aspiration technique was performed.

- **Results**: Twenty patients were enrolled and had cultures obtained. The etiologic agent was determined in 15% (3/20) of patients. The positive cultures were all MRSA.

- **Conclusions**: Although needle aspiration of cellulitis was of low yield, the only pathogens isolated in this study were CA-MRSA. Empiric antibiotics for cellulitis should include coverage for MRSA. In circumstances in which bacterial etiology and antibiotic susceptibility knowledge would be critical, needle aspiration should be considered.

### Management of skin and soft-tissue infections before and after clinical pathway implementation [^112REywX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We evaluated if the introduction of a clinical pathway for skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) would reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-directed therapy for simple cellulitis and antibiotic use for simple abscess after drainage. We compared the treatment of SSTI during a 3-month prepathway and 11-month postpathway period. We included patients 57 days to 18 years old discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cellulitis or abscess.

- **Balancing measures**: Included 72-hour revisit rate and ED length of stay (LOS).

A total of 291 patients prepathway and 781 patients postpathway were included. The proportion of patients with simple cellulitis prescribed MRSA-directed therapy decreased from 81% to 54% postpathway. The proportion of patients with a drained abscess prescribed systemic antibiotics decreased from 88% to 75%. There was no increase in 72-hour revisit rates (3.8% vs 3.2%, P = 0.64) or ED LOS (2.8 vs 2.7 hours, P = 0.05).

### Cellulitis in pediatric patients: Recognition and management in the era of evolving resistance [^111i55wF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection most frequently caused by group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and less often by Staphylococcus aureus, is commonly seen in pediatric patients. The non-specific clinical presentation, characterized by poorly demarcated, expanding erythema and warmth, is common to many similarly presenting conditions. This overlap contributes to challenges in achieving an accurate diagnosis. There is no gold standard diagnostic test for cellulitis, as laboratory assessments, tissue and blood cultures, and imaging studies have not been consistently helpful. These adjunctive studies, however, may be utilized to rule out mimickers or more serious complicating conditions, such as osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or abscesses.

Diagnosis remains largely clinical, with evaluation by a dermatologist and/or infectious disease specialist being the clinical gold standard. Consequently, access to specialty care and further research into helpful adjunctive measures, such as thermal imaging, are crucial for accurate diagnosis and management to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use. Multidrug resistance has continued to evolve since the initial emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). More recent studies indicate an overall decline in MRSA in the community, with the highest rates remaining in the Southern region of the United States.

Despite the changing resistance patterns, inappropriate prescribing practices have persisted, contributing to rising rates of resistance to antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin.

### Who can have parenteral antibiotics at home? A prospective observational study in children with moderate/severe cellulitis [^1164f7aQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The benefits of treating children at home or in an ambulatory setting have been well documented. This study aimed to describe the characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of children with moderate/severe cellulitis treated at home with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, referred directly from the Emergency Department to a hospital-in-the-home (HITH) program.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 3 months to 18 years with moderate/severe cellulitis referred from a tertiary pediatric Emergency Department to HITH from September 2012 to January 2014 were prospectively identified. Data collection included demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes. To ensure home treatment did not result in inferior outcomes, these patients were retrospectively compared with patients hospitalized for IV flucloxacillin, the standard-of-care over the same period. The primary outcome was home treatment failure necessitating hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic changes, complications, length of stay, and cost.

- **Results**: Forty-one (28%) patients were treated on HITH, and 103 (72%) were hospitalized. Compared with hospitalized patients, HITH patients were older (P < 0.01) and less likely to have periorbital cellulitis (P = 0.01) or fever (P = 0.04). There were no treatment failures under HITH care. The rate of antibiotic changes was similar in both groups (5% vs. 7%, P = 0.67), as was IV antibiotic duration (2.3 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.23).

Conclusion: Older children with moderate/severe limb cellulitis without systemic symptoms can be treated at home.

The aim of this study is to investigate gender differences in the disease severity and management of orbital infections in children hospitalized for treatment.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of all children aged 0 to 18 years who had a confirmed diagnosis of preseptal or postseptal cellulitis and were hospitalized over a 15-year period.

- **Results**: The sample consisted of 124 children, 52.4% male, with a mean age of 7.1 years (SD = 4.88, range = 4.9–18) and a relatively equal distribution between preseptal (52.4%) and postseptal (47.6%) cellulitis. Although males and females did not differ in rates of preseptal and postseptal cellulitis and Lund-Mackay scores (p > 0.05 for all), males were more likely to undergo surgical management (21.5% vs 8.5%; p = 0.049).

- **Conclusion**: Additional research is needed to understand why the management of cellulitis differs between male and female pediatric patients and how it may affect treatment outcomes.

### Variation in care and clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis [^111onPsh]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To describe variation in the care of children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis and to determine associations with length of stay (LOS), emergency department (ED) revisits, and hospital readmissions, a study was conducted. By using the Pediatric Health Information System, a multicenter, retrospective study was performed on children aged 2 months to 18 years with a primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnosis code for orbital cellulitis from 2007 to 2014. Hospital-level variation in the use of diagnostic tests, corticosteroids, and antibiotics was assessed individually and in aggregate for association with outcomes (LOS, ED revisits, readmissions) after risk-adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors.

A total of 1828 children met inclusion criteria. Complete blood cell counts (median [interquartile range]: 81.8% [66.7–89.6]), C-reactive protein levels (57.1% [22.2–84.0]), blood cultures (57.9% [48.9–63.6]), and computed tomography imaging (74.7% [66.7–81.0]) were the most frequently performed diagnostic tests, with significant variation observed across hospitals (all P < .001). Corticosteroids were used in 29.2% of children (interquartile range: 18.4–37.5). There was significant variation in antibiotic exposure across hospitals (P < .001). Increased total diagnostic test usage was associated with increased LOS (P = 0.044), but not with 30-day ED revisits (P = 0.176) or readmissions (P = 0.403).

In conclusion, children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis experience wide variation in clinical care and outcomes.

### Association between corticosteroids and outcomes in children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis [^112X68Tp]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022).

To examine the association between systemic corticosteroid use and outcomes for children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis at US children's hospitals, we conducted a multicenter observational study using administrative data from the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2007 to 2019. Children between the ages of 2 months and 18 years with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnostic codes of orbital cellulitis were included. The primary exposure was the receipt of systemic corticosteroids on the day of hospital admission. The primary outcome was the hospital length of stay, and secondary outcomes included surgical intervention, ICU admissions, revisits, and health care costs. We used a generalized logit model with inverse probability weighting logistic regression to adjust for demographic factors and assess differences in clinical outcomes reported.

Of the 5832 patients hospitalized with orbital cellulitis, 330 (5.7%) were in the corticosteroid group and 5502 (94.3%) were in the non-corticosteroid group. Patients in the corticosteroid group were older, had more severe illness, and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. In adjusted analyses, corticosteroid exposure was not associated with differences in length of hospital stay, need for surgical intervention, ICU admissions, emergency department revisits, 30-day hospital readmissions, or hospital costs. Restricting the analysis to only those patients who received broad-spectrum antibiotics did not yield different results.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and increased health care costs.

The objective of this study was to determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment in patients with cellulitis.

This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up duration. Patients were randomized to the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. A medical chart review of demographic information and hospital courses was performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1,300 patients were screened, 1,125 were excluded, and 175 were included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Results showed that of the 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men, with a mean age of 58.8 years. The length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The analysis of the duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, with a focus on treatments lasting less than 4 days, revealed significant insights.

### Point-of-care ultrasound on management of cellulitis versus local angioedema in the pediatric emergency department [^1122xnD2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether ultrasound can differentiate between cellulitis and angioedema from insect bites in pediatric patients, a prospective, pre-post study was conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department. Patients younger than 21 years with soft tissue swelling from insect bites, without abscesses, were enrolled. The treating physician's pretest opinions regarding the diagnosis and need for antibiotics were determined. Ultrasound of the affected areas was performed, and effects on management were recorded. Further imaging, medications, and disposition were at the discretion of the enrolling physician. Follow-up phone calls were made within a week of presentation.

Results indicated that among 103 patients enrolled with soft tissue swelling secondary to insect bites, ultrasound changed the management in 27 (26%) patients (95% confidence interval, 18–35%). Of the patients who were indeterminate or believed to require antibiotics, ultrasound changed management in 6 (23%) of 26 patients (95% CI, 6%-40%). In those patients who were believed not to require antibiotics, ultrasound changed management in 12 (16%) of 77 patients (95% CI, 7%-24%). Patients with a diagnosis of local angioedema achieved symptom resolution 1.4 days sooner than patients diagnosed with cellulitis (mean, -1.389; 95% CI, -2.087 to -0.690; P < 0.001). No patient initially diagnosed with local angioedema received antibiotics upon patient follow-up.

In conclusion, point-of-care ultrasound changed physician management in 1 of 4 patients in the pediatric emergency department with soft tissue swelling secondary to insect bites.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis.

Diagnostic criteria or tools are defined as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically relevant.

### Preseptal and orbital cellulitis: Analysis of clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of 123 pediatric cases from Turkey [^113KXkHu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics and imaging methods of patients diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis in the pediatric age group.

- **Methods**: The study was designed retrospectively, and the medical records of all patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis were reviewed. The findings of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis groups were compared. The risk factors for the development of orbital involvement were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 123 patients were included, with 90.2% diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and 9.8% with orbital cellulitis. The male gender ratio was 60.2%, and the mean age was 72 ± 43 months. While all patients had eyelid swelling and redness, 20.3% had fever. Ocular involvement was found in 51.2% of the right eyes and 4.9% of both eyes. The most common predisposing factor was rhinosinusitis (56.1%). Radiologic imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) was performed in 83.7% of the patients. A subperiostal abscess was detected in 7 cases (5.6%); three of these cases were managed surgically, while four were treated medically. The levels of C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients with orbital involvement (P = 0.033), but there was no difference between the presence of fever, leukocyte, and platelet values.

- **Conclusions**: Rhinosinusitis was the most common predisposing factor in the development of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis. Orbital involvement was present in 9.8% of the patients.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Do patients with cellulitis need to be hospitalized? A systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality rates of inpatients with cellulitis [^114RuFHK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the United States, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "other cellulitis and abscess" accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances, but there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia that are currently recommended for outpatient management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model, and heterogeneity was estimated using the I² statistic.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.7–1.8). For studies from the United States, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3–0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one third of deaths appeared to be due to infection.

- **Discussion**: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Ambulatory intravenous antibiotic therapy for children with preseptal cellulitis [^117KqU2Z]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the use of outpatient ambulatory care versus admission for intravenous antibiotics in the management of preseptal cellulitis.

- **Methods**: This retrospective consecutive cohort study involved children younger than 16 years presenting to an Inner London Pediatric Emergency Department with signs and symptoms of preseptal cellulitis.

- **Results**: A total of 94 cases were identified during a 17-month period. Of them, 30 children were prescribed oral antibiotics, and one child did not receive treatment. Of the 63 children prescribed intravenous antibiotics, 42 were managed on an ambulatory basis and 21 were admitted. There was no significant difference in the duration of treatment in days between those on ambulatory management and those admitted (2.79 ± 0.8 vs. 2.76 ± 1.9, P = 0.94) or in the rate of complications. The net cost saving was $205,924 (£131,065; €147,578) overall, which equals $4900 (£3120; €3513) per patient.

- **Conclusions**: Ambulatory intravenous antibiotics with daily review are a safe and cost-effective alternative to inpatient admission in simple preseptal cellulitis for children in our population who require parenteral antibiotics.

### Narrative review: Diseases that masquerade as infectious cellulitis [^113JQWLj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

For cellulitis that does not respond to conventional antimicrobial treatment, clinicians should consider several noninfectious disorders that might masquerade as infectious cellulitis.

- **Common masqueraders**: Diseases commonly include thrombophlebitis, contact dermatitis, insect stings, drug reactions, eosinophilic cellulitis (the Wells syndrome), gouty arthritis, carcinoma erysipelatoides, familial Mediterranean fever, and foreign-body reactions.

- **Uncommon masqueraders**: Diseases that uncommonly present as infectious cellulitis comprise urticaria, lymphedema, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, leukemia, Paget disease, and panniculitis. Clinicians should conduct an initial diagnostic work-up directed by the findings from a detailed history and complete physical examination. In many cases, skin biopsy is the only tool that aids in identifying the correct diagnosis. Special tests may also be needed.

### Burden, risk factors, and infectious complications of cellulitis and erysipelas in US adults and children in the emergency department setting [^116Ncg2p]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about the use and burden of emergency department (ED) visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, risk factors, complications, and cost of emergency care for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study of the 2006 to 2016 National Emergency Department Sample, including a 20% sample of US ED visits (N = 320,080,467).

- **Results**: The mean annual incidence of ED visits with a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas was 2.42 to 3.55 per million adult and 1.14 to 2.09 per million pediatric ED visits. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas decreased significantly from 2006 to 2015 (Rao-Scott chi-square, P < .0001). ED visits with versus without a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with public or no insurance and lower household income quartiles and were more likely to occur during weekends and summer months. The mean cost of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas more than doubled in adults (from $720 to $1680) and tripled in children (from $939 to $2,823) from 2006 to 2016. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with multiple risk factors and increased infectious complications.

- **Limitations**: No data on cellulitis and erysipelas treatment or recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: There is a substantial and increasing burden of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States. Many ED visits occurred for uncomplicated cellulitis/erysipelas, in part because of health care disparities.

### Randomized, controlled trial of antibiotics in the management of community-acquired skin abscesses in the pediatric patient [^1126Woy3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). High credibility.

The study objective is to address the increasing emergency department visits for skin and soft tissue infections due to the discovery of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The controversy lies in whether surgically treated abscesses also require antibiotics. Notably, there are no published pediatric randomized controlled trials assessing the need for antibiotics in managing skin abscesses. This study aims to determine the benefits of antibiotics in surgically managed pediatric skin abscesses.

- **Methods**: This study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving pediatric patients who were randomized to receive either a 10-day course of placebo or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after incision and drainage. Follow-up consisted of a visit or call at 10 to 14 days, and a call at 90 days. The primary outcome was treatment failure at the 10-day follow-up, while the secondary outcome was the development of new lesions at the 10- and 90-day follow-ups. Noninferiority of placebo relative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for both primary and secondary outcomes was assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 161 patients were enrolled, with 12 lost to follow-up. Failure rates were 5.3% (n = 4/76) in the placebo group and 4.1% (n = 3/73) in the antibiotic group, resulting in a difference of 1.2%, with a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) from -infinity to 6.8%. Noninferiority was established with an equivalence threshold of 7%. New lesions at the 10-day follow-up occurred in 19 patients receiving placebo (26.4%) and in 9 patients receiving antibiotics (12.9%), with a difference of 13.5% and a 95% one-sided CI from -infinity to 24.3%. At the 3-month follow-up, 15 of 52 patients (28.8%) in the placebo group and 13 in the antibiotic group developed new lesions.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years, and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and…

### What is the utility of point-of-care ultrasound for diagnosis of soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis [^114vUVFq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including cellulitis and abscess, are common conditions managed in the emergency department. However, differentiating these solely on history and physical examination can be challenging. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been proposed as a tool to distinguish abscess from cellulitis.

- **Clinical question**: What is the utility of POCUS for diagnosing soft tissue abscess versus cellulitis?

- **Evidence review**: Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of POCUS for diagnosing abscess. These studies provide estimates of the potential utility of POCUS in differentiating abscess and cellulitis.

- **Conclusion**: Based upon the available literature, POCUS can reliably differentiate abscess and cellulitis and assist with the management of SSTIs.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113im5Mo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, with additional reference to the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (record CRD42017080466, November 2017).

- **Objectives**: The primary objective for this review was to identify and describe diagnostic criteria and tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess the quality of the studies where diagnostic criteria or tools were developed.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies including patients with lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas in primary and secondary care, which used diagnostic criteria or tools for diagnosis, were included.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The following inclusion criteria were applied: any study type that used diagnostic criteria or tools, in any language, involving patients of any age, sex, or ethnicity, who had lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The following articles were excluded: animal studies; laboratory in vitro studies; literature and systematic review articles; expert opinions; conference abstracts; articles that included only patients with non-lower-limb cellulitis; articles where the site of cellulitis or erysipelas was not clear; articles where data from lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas could not be separated; articles that used tools to determine etiology; and case series with fewer than 20 patients.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^117Dqssm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting > 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates.

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S. aureus and enterococci strains. Guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSI were published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABS.

### Odontogenic infection causing orbital cellulitis in a pediatric patient [^1159k8Qq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Odontogenic abscesses can develop into orbital cellulitis, leading to potentially serious intracranial and orbital complications. The full range of clinical complications arising from odontogenic orbital cellulitis in a pediatric patient is rarely observed daily in hospital emergency departments. Consequently, odontogenic orbital cellulitis remains a rarity, posing a medical challenge. This study aimed to describe a case of periorbital and orbital cellulitis resulting from an odontogenic origin in a 6-year-old patient. The patient was successfully treated through the administration of intravenous antibiotics combined with surgical drainage.
