## Question

A 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic stable angina presents with worsening exertional dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance over the past 6 months. Echocardiography reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 32%. Coronary angiography demonstrates multivessel coronary artery disease with significant stenoses in the proximal left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery, and circumflex artery. He has been on optimal medical therapy, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and nitrates, but continues to experience angina symptoms. He is considered suitable for surgical intervention. The heart team is discussing the best revascularization strategy.

Based on current ESC guidelines, what is the most appropriate revascularization strategy for this patient, and what factors support your recommendation?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which revascularization strategy is most appropriate for a 62-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, multivessel coronary artery disease, and LVEF 32% who remains symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy, and what factors support that recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify guideline-directed indications for revascularization in chronic coronary syndromes with reduced LVEF. Next, I will compare CABG versus PCI in this specific phenotype, including diabetes and multivessel disease. After that, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline class/level. Finally, I will consider patient-specific modifiers, the role of the Heart Team, and outline the recommendation with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype and risk profile. This patient has chronic coronary syndrome with refractory angina, multivessel disease including the proximal LAD, and severe LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF 32%, plus diabetes mellitus, which collectively place him in a high-risk category where revascularization can confer prognostic benefit beyond symptom relief, provided anatomy is suitable and the patient is a surgical candidate [^2badddd0] [^cec2a5d8].

> Wait, let me verify the indication for revascularization in reduced LVEF. The 2024 ESC chronic coronary syndromes guideline recommends CABG over medical therapy alone to improve long-term survival in surgically eligible patients with multivessel CAD and LVEF ≤ 35%, and it also advises revascularization in addition to GDMT when there is functionally significant three-vessel disease with LVEF > 35% to improve survival and reduce cardiovascular mortality and spontaneous MI, underscoring that both anatomy and ventricular function drive decisions here [^2badddd0] [^97bbb917]. I should also confirm that the 2018 ESC/EACTS revascularization guidance supports revascularization to improve survival in stable CAD with impaired LV function when suitable for intervention, which aligns with this case [^cec2a5d8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality. I need to compare CABG versus PCI in this exact phenotype. In diabetes with multivessel disease, FREEDOM showed that CABG reduced all-cause mortality and MI compared with PCI at 5 years, with the mortality advantage emerging after 2 years, albeit at the cost of more stroke, which is a critical trade-off to discuss during shared decision-making [^65fc626f] [^54b4b1c5]. Let me consider pooled analyses as well; a patient-level pooled analysis of trials in diabetic multivessel CAD demonstrated that CABG plus OMT was superior to PCI plus OMT for death, MI, and the composite endpoint, reinforcing CABG as preferred when anatomy and surgical risk permit [^86cab553].

> I should double-check the LV dysfunction dimension specifically. The STICH program and long-term follow-up showed that in ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤ 35%, CABG plus GDMT improved survival versus GDMT alone at 10 years, and contemporary heart failure guidelines continue to recognize CABG as the revascularization strategy with proven survival benefit in this setting, whereas PCI has not demonstrated a survival advantage in randomized trials of HFrEF to date [^45a844f3] [^74c3630f]. But wait, what if PCI could still be reasonable symptomatically? Even if PCI relieves angina, the mortality signal in this high-risk, multivessel, diabetic, low-LVEF phenotype favors CABG for prognosis, so I should not over-attribute symptomatic benefit to improved survival with PCI here [^be0f23a7].

> Next, I should review guideline strength and consensus. The 2024 ESC CCS gives a strong recommendation for CABG over medical therapy alone in multivessel CAD with LVEF ≤ 35% in surgically eligible patients, and ACC/AHA/SCAI guidance similarly recommends CABG to improve survival in stable ischemic heart disease with multivessel disease and severe LV systolic dysfunction, with FREEDOM informing the diabetes-specific preference for CABG in multivessel disease [^2badddd0] [^79514072] [^f08cdd45]. I need to ensure I note that while PCI can be considered in selected patients, especially if surgical risk is high or anatomy is favorable, it has not shown a survival benefit in this exact HFrEF, multivessel, diabetic context in randomized trials [^45a844f3].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that could sway the choice. Age 62 is not a prohibitive surgical risk, and there is no mention of frailty, porcelain aorta, or poor conduit availability, which would push toward PCI or hybrid strategies. Conversely, diabetes, multivessel disease including proximal LAD, and LVEF 32% all favor CABG when feasible, and the absence of contraindications to surgery supports proceeding with CABG in a center with good surgical outcomes [^f08cdd45] [^18f9ff07]. I should confirm that the Heart Team will weigh DAPT adherence, life expectancy, and patient preferences, but in a 62-year-old with these risk features, the balance still favors CABG for survival [^12f403df].

> I will now examine the role of the Heart Team and shared decision-making. Contemporary guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary Heart Team to integrate anatomy, physiology, ventricular function, comorbidities, and patient values, and to communicate trade-offs such as the early stroke risk with CABG versus the higher rates of death and repeat revascularization with PCI in diabetes, so that the patient can make an informed, value-concordant choice [^74b1e829] [^12f403df]. Hold on, I should verify that this discussion includes expectations for symptom relief, recovery, and long-term surveillance, which improves adherence and outcomes when aligned with patient goals [^12f403df].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The most appropriate revascularization strategy for this 62-year-old man with diabetes, multivessel CAD including proximal LAD, and LVEF 32% who remains symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy is coronary artery bypass grafting, because it offers the strongest evidence for improving long-term survival in this exact phenotype, with the caveat of a higher early stroke risk that must be discussed transparently [^2badddd0] [^65fc626f] [^45a844f3]. PCI may be considered only if surgical risk is prohibitive or the patient declines CABG after informed discussion, recognizing that PCI will likely palliate symptoms but has not demonstrated a survival advantage in this setting [^f08cdd45] [^45a844f3].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses ongoing care. Regardless of revascularization, he should continue guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF and diabetes, with close follow-up for symptom control, ventricular function, and secondary prevention, and the Heart Team should remain engaged for any changes in anatomy, symptoms, or patient preferences over time [^3dd9d1bf] [^74b1e829]. If CABG is deferred for any reason, I should reconsider PCI selectively for symptom relief while acknowledging the prognostic limitations in this high-risk phenotype and reassess candidacy for surgery periodically [^f08cdd45].

The most appropriate revascularization strategy for this patient is **CABG** [^2badddd0] because he has multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced LVEF (32%) and persistent angina despite optimal medical therapy. Current ESC guidelines recommend CABG over PCI in this scenario to improve long-term survival and reduce cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction [^2badddd0] [^97bbb917]. PCI is not favored here due to higher rates of repeat revascularization and inferior outcomes in patients with diabetes and low LVEF [^65fc626f] [^86cab553]. The decision should be confirmed by a Heart Team, but CABG is the evidence-based choice for this patient profile [^74b1e829].

---

## Evidence-based revascularization strategy

### ESC guidelines recommendations

The 2024 ESC guidelines for chronic coronary syndromes provide clear recommendations for this patient profile:

- **CABG recommendation**: CABG is recommended over medical therapy alone to improve long-term survival in surgically eligible patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and LVEF ≤ 35% [^2badddd0].
- **PCI consideration**: PCI may be considered in patients with multivessel disease and preserved LV function or in those who are poor surgical candidates, but it is not the preferred strategy in patients with reduced LVEF and complex multivessel disease [^5d64f212] [^11eee8db].
- **Heart team approach**: The decision should be made by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, considering patient-specific factors, coronary anatomy, and patient preferences [^74b1e829].

---

### Comparative evidence: CABG vs. PCI

Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated the superiority of CABG over PCI in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, diabetes, and reduced LVEF:

| **Study** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| FREEDOM trial | - CABG significantly reduced all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction compared to PCI in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease [^65fc626f] <br/> - Higher stroke risk with CABG, but overall cardiovascular outcomes favored CABG [^54b4b1c5] |
| STICH trial | - CABG improved long-term survival in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and LVEF ≤ 35% compared to medical therapy alone [^45a844f3] <br/> - No significant benefit with PCI in this patient population [^notfound] |
| Meta-analyses | - Consistently show survival advantage of CABG over PCI in patients with multivessel disease, diabetes, and reduced LVEF [^86cab553] |

---

### Patient-specific factors influencing decision

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Patients with diabetes have more diffuse, aggressive coronary disease and benefit more from CABG due to improved long-term survival and reduced myocardial infarction rates [^65fc626f] [^04c19123].
- **Reduced LVEF**: CABG confers a survival benefit in patients with LVEF ≤ 35% and multivessel disease, whereas PCI has not demonstrated similar survival advantages in this population [^2badddd0] [^45a844f3].
- **Persistent angina**: Despite optimal medical therapy, ongoing ischemic symptoms indicate the need for revascularization to improve quality of life and prognosis [^be0f23a7].

---

## Risks and benefits of CABG vs. PCI

| **Parameter** | **Cabg** | **Pci** |
|-|-|-|
| Survival benefit | Significant long-term survival advantage in patients with reduced LVEF and multivessel disease [^2badddd0] [^45a844f3] | No demonstrated survival advantage in this patient population [^45a844f3] |
| Myocardial infarction risk | Lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to PCI [^65fc626f] [^86cab553] | Higher risk of myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization [^65fc626f] [^04c19123] |
| Stroke risk | Higher perioperative stroke risk [^65fc626f] [^04c19123] | Lower stroke risk compared to CABG [^65fc626f] [^04c19123] |
| Repeat revascularization | Lower need for repeat revascularization [^65fc626f] [^86cab553] | Higher need for repeat revascularization [^65fc626f] [^04c19123] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's multivessel coronary artery disease, reduced LVEF, diabetes, and persistent angina despite optimal medical therapy, **CABG is the most appropriate revascularization strategy** [^2badddd0]. It offers the best evidence-based approach to improve long-term survival, reduce myocardial infarction, and alleviate ischemic symptoms. PCI may be considered only if the patient is a poor surgical candidate or if there are specific anatomical considerations that favor a percutaneous approach, but it is not the preferred strategy in this scenario [^5d64f212] [^11eee8db]. The final decision should be confirmed by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, incorporating patient preferences and clinical judgment [^74b1e829].

### Revascularization strategies for patients with stable coronary artery disease [^23627b73]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with coronary artery disease who have prognostically significant lesions or symptoms despite optimum medical therapy require mechanical revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or both. In this review, we will evaluate the evidence-based use of the two revascularization approaches in treating patients with coronary artery disease. CABG has been the predominant mode of revascularization for more than half a century and is the preferred strategy for patients with multivessel disease, especially those with diabetes mellitus, left ventricular systolic dysfunction or complex lesions. There have been significant technical and technological advances in PCI over recent years, and this is now the preferred revascularization modality in patients with single-vessel or low-risk multivessel disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention can also be considered to treat complex multivessel disease in patients with increased risk of adverse surgical outcomes including frail patients and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Improvements in both CABG (including total arterial revascularization, off-pump CABG and 'no-touch' graft harvesting) and PCI (including newer-generation stents, adjunctive pharmacotherapy and intracoronary imaging) mean that they will continue to challenge each other in the future. A 'heart team' approach is strongly recommended to select an evidence-based, yet individualized, revascularization strategy for all patients with complex coronary artery disease. Finally, optimal medical therapy is important for all patients with coronary artery disease, regardless of the mode of revascularization.

### The evolving pattern of symptomatic coronary artery disease in the United States and Canada: baseline characteristics of the clinical outcomes utilizing revascularization and aggressive druG evaluation (COURAGE) trial [^4153e853]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Major improvements in medical therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery disease (CAD) have emerged during the previous 2 decades, but no randomized trial in patients with stable CAD has been powered to compare these 2 strategies for the hard clinical end points of death or myocardial infarction (MI), and previous studies have not evaluated the effect of coronary stents and intensive medical therapy on cardiac events during long-term follow-up. Between 1999 and 2004, 2,287 patients with documented myocardial ischemia and angiographically confirmed CAD were randomized to the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive DruG Evaluation (COURAGE) trial, with a principal hypothesis that a strategy of percutaneous coronary intervention plus intensive, guideline-driven medical therapy would be superior to a strategy of intensive medical therapy alone. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality or acute MI (time to first event) during a 2.5- to 7-year (median 5) follow-up. Baseline characteristics were a mean age of 62 ± 5 years, 85% men, and 86% Caucasian. Mean duration of angina before randomization was 26 months (average 10 episodes/week), and 29% of patients were smokers, 67% had hypertension, 38% had previous MI, 71% had dyslipidemia, 34% had diabetes, 27% had previous revascularization, and 69% had multivessel CAD. Approximately 55% of patients met established criteria for the metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, baseline characteristics of the COURAGE trial study population indicate a highly symptomatic group of patients with CAD who have a significant duration and frequency of antecedent angina pectoris and a high prevalence of cardiac risk factors.

### Optimal revascularization for complex coronary artery disease [^bc11ada6]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with major or symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) commonly undergo revascularization — either with CABG surgery, which has been the mainstay of revascularization for more than half a century, or with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which has become the more-commonly used strategy in the past decade. PCI has been tested in more randomized clinical trials than any other procedure in contemporary practice. In general, PCI is the preferred option for treating patients with simple coronary artery lesions and CABG surgery remains the standard of care for patients with complex CAD. Technical advancements in PCI and CABG surgery make comparisons of historical data for these strategies difficult. In this Review, we evaluate the evidence-based use of PCI and CABG surgery in treating patients with multivessel and unprotected left main stem disease and for specific patient groups, including those with diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Finally, we highlight the available tools to aid decision-making, including clinical guidelines, risk scoring systems, and the role of the 'heart team'.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic stable angina: a reassessment [^90f1dbf1]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

As it approaches its fourth decade, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now the most widely used revascularization strategy around the world and has been tested in multiple clinical scenarios against both medical and surgical therapies. For each patient group and clinical scenario setting, the goals of therapy must be specifically defined and clearly understood as an integral component of the process of selecting the optimal strategy for the individual patient. In patients with chronic stable, often mild angina, the major achievable goals of PCI are to affect symptoms, either by decreasing them or preventing them, reduce the need for subsequent procedures, and relieve ischemia. Achievement of these goals has been documented in multiple randomized trials of PCI versus medical therapy. In these trials of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), however, no reduction in death and myocardial infarction has been observed, and these limitations of PCI in this clinical setting need to be emphasized. Given the typically diffuse nature of CAD and the fact that PCI only treats a segment within a coronary artery, this is not surprising. Although optimal medical therapy forms the cornerstone of management for any patient with CAD, among stable patients who do fail medical therapy, percutaneous coronary revascularization plays a well-documented significant role in improving symptoms and preventing the subsequent need for revascularization. The appropriate utilization rates of PCI in patients with chronic stable angina and preserved left ventricular function should lead to more cost-effective care of patients with stable CAD.

### Effects of optimal medical treatment with or without coronary revascularization on angina and subsequent revascularizations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable ischemic heart disease [^e9e1d494]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial, an initial strategy of coronary revascularization and optimal medical treatment (REV) compared with an initial optimal medical treatment with the option of subsequent revascularization (MED) did not reduce all-cause mortality or the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable ischemic heart disease. In the same population, we tested whether the REV strategy was superior to the MED strategy in preventing worsening and new angina and subsequent coronary revascularizations.

Methods and Results

Among the 2364 men and women (mean age, 62.4 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, documented coronary artery disease, and myocardial ischemia, 1191 were randomized to the MED and 1173 to the REV strategy preselected in the percutaneous coronary intervention (796) and coronary artery bypass graft (377) strata. Compared with the MED strategy, the REV strategy at the 3-year follow-up had a lower rate of worsening angina (8% versus 13%; P < 0.001), new angina (37% versus 51%; P = 0.001), and subsequent coronary revascularizations (18% versus 33%; P < 0.001) and a higher rate of angina-free status (66% versus 58%; P = 0.003). The coronary artery bypass graft stratum patients were at higher risk than those in the percutaneous coronary intervention stratum, and had the greatest benefits from REV.

Conclusions

In these patients, the REV strategy reduced the occurrence of worsening angina, new angina, and subsequent coronary revascularizations more than the MED strategy. The symptomatic benefits were observed particularly for high-risk patients.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to choice of revascularization, CABG, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to perform myocardial revascularization with CABG over medical therapy alone to improve long-term survival in surgically eligible patients with chronic coronary syndrome with multivessel CAD and LVEF ≤ 35%.

### Optimal medical therapy is a proven option for chronic stable angina [^ae57171e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The authors of the meta-analysis of a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-based invasive strategy for improving prognosis for the treatment of angina conclude that a pooling of data from various studies can be sufficiently powered to evaluate the impact of PCI on long-term mortality. However, most randomized coronary artery patient trials have insufficient power to detect significant differences in hard end points. Randomized trials in patients with chronic stable angina enroll few patients who are over age 65 years, have depressed ventricular function, have clinical instability, or who have undergone previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or PCI. "Medical therapy" today no longer means the absence of PCI, but rather the presence of intensive, evidence-based pharmacologic intervention. The COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive druG Evaluation) trial randomized 2,287 patients to optimal medical therapy alone or optimal medical therapy plus PCI. Optimal medical therapy consisted of antiplatelet therapy, anti-ischemic therapy, and aggressive lipid and blood pressure control. Based on the strength of the evidence, the author of this commentary recommends more-aggressive medical therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe angina, and PCI or CABG for many patients in whom symptoms persist. Optimal medical therapy is a proven option for chronic stable angina.

### Rationale for the revascularization arm of the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation 2 diabetes (BARI 2D) trial [^fc760743]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Modern coronary revascularization therapies, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), continue to evolve and are widely applied. However, for patients with mild stable angina, or those who are asymptomatic with angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD), no survival benefit or reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction has been demonstrated with CABG or PCI, except in the case of subgroups with angiographically determined high risk due to extensive multivessel disease with depressed LV function or left main CAD. At the same time, medical therapy continues to advance, with demonstrable benefit in both primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic coronary disease events. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, at increased risk for adverse cardiac events, have been shown to benefit from these approaches as well. However, in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with documented ischemia and angiographically significant CAD, the incremental benefit-or hazard-associated with early revascularization superimposed on aggressive medical and risk factor modification therapies is unknown. We discuss the background and rationale for investigating the impact of early revascularization in patients with diabetes and CAD.

### Stable coronary artery disease: revascularisation and invasive strategies [^29d41317]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease is the most common clinical manifestation of ischaemic heart disease and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Myocardial revascularisation is a mainstay in the treatment of symptomatic patients or those with ischaemia-producing coronary lesions, and reduces ischaemia to a greater extent than medical treatment. Documentation of ischaemia and plaque burden is fundamental in the risk stratification of patients with stable coronary artery disease, and several invasive and non-invasive techniques are available (eg, fractional flow reserve or intravascular ultrasound) or being validated (eg, instantaneous wave-free ratio and optical coherence tomography). The use of new-generation drug-eluting stents and arterial conduits greatly improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). PCI is feasible, safe, and effective in many patients with stable coronary artery disease who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment. In patients with multivessel and left main coronary artery disease, the decision between PCI or CABG is guided by the local Heart Team (team of different cardiovascular specialists, including non-invasive and invasive cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons), who carefully judge the possible benefits and risks inherent to PCI and CABG. In specific subsets, such as patients with diabetes and advanced, multivessel coronary artery disease, CABG remains the standard of care in view of improved protection against recurrent ischaemic adverse events.

### Medical treatment and revascularization options in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary disease [^86cab553]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are scant outcomes data in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) stratified by detailed angiographic burden of CAD or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Objectives

This study determined the effect of optimal medical therapy (OMT), with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), on long-term outcomes with respect to LVEF and number of diseased vessels, including proximal left anterior descending artery involvement.

Methods

A patient-level pooled analysis was undertaken in 3 federally-funded trials. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, adjusted for trial and randomization strategy.

Results

Among 5,034 subjects, 15% had LVEF < 50%, 77% had multivessel CAD, and 28% had proximal left anterior descending artery involvement. During a median 4.5-year follow-up, CABG + OMT was superior to PCI + OMT for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 0.85; p = 0.0002), death (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.96; p = 0.024), and MI (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.67; p = 0.0001), but not stroke (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.96 to 2.48; p = 0.074). CABG + OMT was also superior to OMT alone for prevention of the primary endpoint (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.022) and MI (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74; p = 0.0001), and was superior to PCI + OMT for the primary endpoint in patients with 3-vessel CAD (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.89; p = 0.002) and normal LVEF (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.87; p = 0.0012). There were no significant differences in OMT versus PCI + OMT.

Conclusions

CABG + OMT reduced the primary endpoint during long-term follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable CAD, supporting this as the preferred management strategy.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to indications for revascularization, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to choose between revascularization or medical therapy alone, after careful evaluation, preferably by the heart team, of coronary anatomy, correlation between CAD and LV dysfunction, comorbidities, life expectancy, individual risk-to-benefit ratio, and patient perspectives in patients with chronic coronary syndrome with LVEF ≤ 35%.

### Optimal approaches to diabetic patients with multivessel disease [^ea8543ce]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of diabetes and systemic insulin resistance contributes to the nature of diffuse atherosclerosis and a high prevalence of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in diabetic patients. The optimal approach to this patient population remains a subject of an ongoing discussion. In this review, we give an overview of the unique pathophysiology of CAD in patients with diabetes, summarize the current state of therapies available, and compare modalities of revascularization that have been investigated in recent clinical trials. We conclude by highlighting the importance of a comprehensive heart team approach to every patient while accommodating both patient preference and quality-of-life decisions.

Multivessel coronary artery disease — survival evidence and recommendation strength: The writing committee states a new Class 2b recommendation, downgraded from Class 1, based on evidence showing no advantage of CABG over medical therapy alone to improve survival in patients with 3-vessel CAD with preserved LV function and no LM disease; the prior evidence base came from registry studies, a meta-analysis, and a single RCT completed ≥ 20 to 40 years ago. After deliberation, the committee concluded that using CABG as a revascularization strategy versus medical therapy alone "may be reasonable" to improve survival in stable patients with 3-vessel CAD. For PCI, the committee concluded that the ability to improve survival compared with medical therapy alone in multivessel CAD remains uncertain, and the recommendation reflects a weaker endorsement for PCI than for CABG.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery remains the standard of care for patients with diabetes [^1ebeaabf]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are proven effective treatments of coronary artery disease (CAD), however, the optimal revascularization strategy remains unclear in certain patient subsets. The recently published "Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease (FREEDOM)" trial is a randomized study evaluating the use of CABG vs PCI in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease. The purpose of this editorial is to review the FREEDOM trial and the available literature guiding clinicians to make evidence-based decisions when treating diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease. The current evidence suggests that CABG should remain the standard of care for this patient population.

Patients with diabetes — synopsis and risk patterns: Revascularization decisions in patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD are complex and are optimized via a Heart Team approach, with consideration of left ventricular function, patient preferences, symptoms, clinical presentation, comorbidities, and expected survival. Diabetes is associated with 2- to 4-fold increased mortality risk from heart disease, and patients with diabetes have more aggressive atherosclerosis, more diffuse coronary lesions, smaller coronary vessels, and more extensive disease. Clinical trials of patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD have demonstrated that PCI is associated with a higher mortality rate at 5 years than that associated with CABG. The survival advantage of CABG becomes evident after 2 years and attenuates after 8 years, as patients treated with CABG experience a late mortality catch-up. Of note, CABG is associated with an increased risk of stroke that persists up to 5 years. The need for repeat revascularization is higher after PCI, regardless of the use of latest-generation drug-eluting stents (DES).

### Influence of revascularization on long-term outcome in patients ≥ 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and angina pectoris [^bba1a95d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Little is known about the effect of revascularization in patients ≥ 75 years of age with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) for whom periprocedural risk and overall mortality are increased. Therefore, we examined the 301 patients of the Trial of Invasive versus Medical therapy in the Elderly with symptomatic CAD (TIME) with special regard to diabetic status. Patients were randomized to an invasive versus optimized medical strategy. The median follow-up was 4.1 years (range 0.1 to 6.9). Patients with DM (n = 69) had a greater incidence of hypertension (73% vs 58%, p = 0.03), ≥ 2 risk factors (93% vs 46%, p < 0.01), previous heart failure (22% vs 12%, p = 0.04), and previous myocardial infarction (59% vs 43%, p = 0.02), and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (48% vs 54%, p = 0.02) than did patients without DM. Mortality was greater in patients with DM than in those without DM (41% vs 25%, p = 0.01; adjusted hazard ratio 1.86, p = 0.01). Revascularization improved the overall survival rate from 61% (no revascularization) to 79% (p < 0.01; adjusted hazard ratio 1.68, p = 0.03), an effect similarly observed in patients with and without DM. The event-free survival rate was 11% in nonrevascularized patients with DM compared with 40% in nonrevascularized patients without DM and 41% and 53% in revascularized patients with and without DM, respectively (p < 0.01). Angina severity and antianginal drug use were similar for patients with and without DM, but those with DM performed worse in daily activities and physical functioning. In conclusion, elderly diabetic patients with chronic angina have a worse outcome than those with DM but benefit similarly from revascularization regarding symptom relief and long-term outcome. However, physical functioning related to daily activities is reduced in those with DM and may need special attention.

Diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease — revascularization choices: Revascularization decisions in patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD are optimized by the use of a Heart Team approach. Patients with diabetes who have triple-vessel disease should undergo surgical revascularization; PCI may be considered if they are poor candidates for surgery. In patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD with involvement of the LAD, who are appropriate candidates for CABG, CABG (with a LIMA to the LAD) is recommended in preference to PCI to reduce mortality and repeat revascularizations. In patients with diabetes, who have multivessel CAD amenable to PCI and an indication for revascularization and are poor candidates for surgery, PCI can be useful to reduce long-term ischemic outcomes. In patients with diabetes, who have left main stenosis and low- or intermediate-complexity CAD in the rest of the coronary anatomy, PCI may be considered an alternative to CABG to reduce major adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Background

The optimal revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) remains uncertain for lack of an adequately powered, randomized trial. The FREEDOM trial was designed to compare contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents in diabetic patients with MVD against a background of optimal medical therapy.

Methods

A total of 1,900 diabetic participants with MVD were randomized to PCI or CABG worldwide from April 2005 to March 2010. FREEDOM is a superiority trial with a mean follow-up of 4.37 years (minimum 2 years) and 80% power to detect a 27.0% relative reduction. We present the baseline characteristics of patients screened and randomized, and provide a comparison with other MVD trials involving diabetic patients.

Results

The randomized cohort was 63.1 ± 9.1 years old and 29% female, with a median diabetes duration of 10.2 ± 8.9 years. Most (83%) had 3-vessel disease and on average took 5.5 ± 1.7 vascular medications, with 32% on insulin therapy. Nearly all had hypertension and/or dyslipidemia, and 26% had a prior myocardial infarction. Mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.8 ± 1.7 mg/dL, 29% had low-density lipoprotein < 70 mg/dL, and mean systolic blood pressure was 134 ± 20 mm Hg. The mean SYNTAX score was 26.2 with a symmetric distribution. FREEDOM trial participants have baseline characteristics similar to those of contemporary multivessel and diabetes trial cohorts.

Conclusions

The FREEDOM trial has successfully recruited a high-risk diabetic MVD cohort. Follow-up efforts include aggressive monitoring to optimize background risk factor control. FREEDOM will contribute significantly to the PCI versus CABG debate in diabetic patients with MVD.

Module 6: myocardial revascularization

35 It is recommended to consider coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the following situations [LEVEL B]:

– Myocardial ischemia symptoms not controlled by medical treatment.

– Suspected extensive myocardial ischemia.

– Suspected ischemia with left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial viability.

– Obstruction of greater than 50% in the left main coronary artery.

Summary of evidence:

- The objectives of myocardial revascularization (MR) are to reduce long-term mortality and improve symptoms and quality of life in patients not well controlled with optimal medical therapy. Patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease have higher long-term mortality compared to patients without diabetes, regardless of treatment strategy. Just as for patients without diabetes, the best criterion for decision MR in patients with diabetes is the clinical assessment, considering the presence of myocardial ischemia (symptoms or evidence of complementary tests), evaluation of coronary anatomy and left ventricular systolic function. Indications for MR in patients with diabetes are similar to those for patients without diabetes, respecting the existing guidelines.

36 Clinical treatment is recommended as the initial strategy in cases of chronic stable coronary artery disease with preserved ventricular function, controlled symptoms, evidence of myocardial ischemia and coronary anatomy without high-risk criteria. [LEVEL B]

Summary of evidence:

- The COURAGE study randomized 2,287 patients with chronic CAD to receive optimal medical therapy or angioplasty with stent associated with clinical treatment. In the subgroup of 766 patients with diabetes there was no difference between groups with respect to the combined endpoint of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.32). Importantly, patients with more severe angina functional class IV (CCS IV), heart failure (HF), ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30%, recent myocardial revascularization and evidence of ischemia at high risk were excluded from the study.

Myocardial revascularisation

NICE recommends revascularisation (by CABG) for patients who have left main stem and/or proximal 3-vessel disease (web addendum table 4). By contrast, the ESC recommends revascularisation to improve prognosis in patients with left main stem disease > 50%*, 2–3-vessel disease with impaired left ventricular function, proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis > 50%*, single remaining vessel with > 50% stenosis*, or a large area of ischaemia (*with documented ischaemia or FFR ≤ 0.8 for stenoses between 50% and 90%).

In symptomatic patients in whom either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) might be appropriate, NICE recommends that the risks and benefits of PCI and CABG are explained and, if no preference is expressed, that the evidence which suggests that PCI may be the more cost-effective procedure is taken into account in selecting treatment. In symptomatic patients with multivessel disease who have diabetes or are over 65 years, or who have anatomically complex 3-vessel disease with or without involvement of the left main stem, NICE recommends that the potential survival advantage of CABG is taken into account in selecting treatment. NICE hints at the use of the SYNTAX score in guiding treatment selection by recommending the use of a systematic approach to assess the severity and complexity of the patient's CAD while also considering their comorbidities. The ESC specifies the use of the SYNTAX score in determining the most appropriate mode of revascularisation in patients with left main stem and/or 3-vessel disease, and is more didactic than NICE in its recommendations regarding the mode of revascularisation in other patient groups. Specifically, it recommends CABG for patients with left main stem disease with 2-vessel or 3-vessel disease and a SYNTAX score > 33, and for patients with 3-vessel disease and a SYNTAX score > 23, and it recommends PCI for patients with 1-vessel or 2-vessel disease without proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, and for patients with left main stem with or without 1-vessel disease, ostium/mid-shaft disease, and patients at high surgical risk. In patients with diabetes with multivessel disease, the ESC favours CABG over PCI.

The multidisciplinary team meeting is promoted in both guidelines for clinical decision-making in more complex patients such as those with left main stem or multivessel disease, complex coronary anatomy, or in patients with comorbidities.

### Cardiac mortality in patients randomised to elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a7342c8c]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease is the most prevalent medical condition worldwide among individuals 50 years or older in terms of disease burden, disability, or early death. Chronic coronary syndromes encompass clinically stable coronary artery disease patients, with or without acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or coronary revascularisation procedures in their natural history. Compared with medical therapy alone, timely revascularisation of epicardial artery obstructions with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% has been demonstrated to confer survival advantage. In clinically stable patients with preserved or moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function, symptomatic benefit favouring revascularisation is well known, but controversy remains regarding prognosis. Significant effects on cardiac mortality of one or the other strategy have not been reported so far. Moreover, no meta-analysis has comprehensively included data at longest follow-up for each available study.

The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial, the largest and most recent randomised comparison of coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone in 5179 patients with stable coronary syndromes and moderate or severe inducible myocardial ischaemia, showed a non-significant difference between the two strategies for the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, hospitalisation for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest at a median follow-up of 3.2 years; at 5 years, the estimated cumulative composite event rates were 16.4% with revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. 18.2% with medical therapy alone, suggesting potential benefit with revascularisation at longer follow-up; the trial lacked statistical power to be conclusive on cardiac-related mortality. In the Fractional flow reserve vs. Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2 (FAME-2) study of 888 patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenoses, the 5-year primary endpoint of death/MI/urgent revascularisation was significantly reduced, with lower rates of spontaneous MI, in the revascularisation plus medical therapy compared with the medical therapy alone arm.

We conducted a meta-analysis of all trials comparing elective coronary revascularisation plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone in patients with preserved or moderately impaired left ventricular ejection fraction to appraise whether revascularisation in addition to medical therapy affects cardiac mortality at longest follow-up.

### Surgical revascularization versus percutaneous coronary intervention and optimal medical therapy in diabetic patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease [^80f5c0e9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with DM and CAD undergoing revascularization with either a surgical or a percutaneous approach are at higher risk of adverse outcomes and mortality compared with non-DM patients. It is within this background that the optimal choice of revascularization is of critical importance in this high-risk population. The large FREEDOM trial randomized 1900 patients with DM and multivessel CAD to either revascularization with coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Compared with PCI, CABG significantly reduced the rates of death and myocardial infarction but was associated with a higher risk of stroke. In a real-world setting the decision-making process for the optimal revascularization strategy in these patients is challenging as many clinical factors may influence the decision to either pursue a surgical or a percutaneous revascularization. However, the current consensus is that CABG should be the preferred revascularization strategy in diabetic patients with extensive multivessel CAD.

Based on this meta-analysis of primarily observational data, complete revascularization (CR) is associated with a reduced risk of death, MI, and repeat revascularization in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD) as compared with incomplete revascularization (IR). Given the current state of evidence, the likelihood of achieving complete revascularization should influence whether PCI or CABG is the best strategy in patients with MVCAD. Given the lack of randomized trials in this area, more robust trial data will address the validity of these findings.

8.2. Patients with diabetes — treatment recommendations: In patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with the involvement of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery who are appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), CABG (with a left internal mammary artery [LIMA] to the LAD) is recommended in preference to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce mortality and repeat revascularizations (Class 1, Level of Evidence A). In patients with diabetes who have multivessel CAD amenable to PCI and an indication for revascularization and are poor candidates for surgery, PCI can be useful to reduce long-term ischemic outcomes (Class 2a, Level of Evidence B-NR). In patients with diabetes who have left main stenosis and low- or intermediate-complexity CAD in the rest of the coronary anatomy, PCI may be considered an alternative to CABG to reduce major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Class 2b, Level of Evidence B-R).

### Physiology-guided myocardial revascularisation in complex multivessel coronary artery disease: beyond the 2014 ESC / EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularisation [^43c5f57c]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

For patients with multivessel coronary artery disease there are two options for revascularisation: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG). In daily clinical practice, a heart team consisting of an interventional cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon decide on the most appropriate mode of revascularization. The current European guidelines on myocardial revascularisation include updated recommendations for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. In patients with stable angina, three-vessel disease and a SYNTAX score of 23–32 or > 32 a class I level of evidence A recommendation for CABG was issued as compared to PCI which received a class III recommendation. Although the authors of this viewpoint greatly appreciate the efforts of the guideline committee, we believe that it was an oversight not to include recommendations on physiology-guided PCI in multivessel disease (MVD). In this viewpoint, it is argued that physiology-guided revascularization using current-generation drug-eluting stents is a reasonable alternative for complex multivessel disease.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina: treatment [^ff69df03]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.

FREEDOM inclusion required multivessel disease with stenosis of 70% in ≥ 2 major epicardial vessels involving at least 2 separate territories and without left main stenosis. After enrollment, 82% of patients in the PCI group and 85% of patients in the CABG group had 3-vessel disease, and 91% of patients had involvement of the LAD artery. At 5-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was higher with PCI than with CABG, while cardiovascular mortality was not statistically different; there was no statistical interaction between SYNTAX score, revascularization strategy, or mortality rate. In FREEDOM follow-up, all-cause mortality up to 8 years was also significantly higher with PCI, and a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 RCTs showed a nearly 50% higher increased 5-year mortality risk with PCI than with CABG.

1.4 Angina

In the management of patients with CCD and stable angina, three primary goals should be at the forefront of any therapeutic strategy. These are the relief of angina symptoms, the prevention of nonfatal occurrences like MI, and improving long‐term survival rates.

The contemporary strategies for managing CCD include revascularization, pharmacological treatment, or a synergistic approach that integrates both modalities. A systematic review has identified key survival predictors in CCD, including the anatomical and functional severity of the condition, LV function, and comorbidities such as diabetes and renal impairment. Management strategies should be customized to each patient's unique clinical profile. Some individuals may benefit from an integrated approach that combines multiple therapeutic interventions, while for others, a single treatment modality may be more advantageous. For example, in patients with CCD with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) or significant left main stenosis, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to offer a survival advantage compared with medical therapy alone.,

Revascularization approaches, including PCI or CABG, as well as pharmacologic approaches reduce symptoms of angina‐related CCD, although medical optimization is always recommended as the first‐line intervention before procedural interventions. This was previously emphasized by the results of three major RCTs: COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation), ISCHEMIA (The International Study of Comparative Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches), and BARI‐2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes), which demonstrated lack of reduction in MACE with nonurgent cardiovascular revascularization beyond the benefit of optimal pharmacologic Goal Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT). Clinicians should prioritize the optimization of GDMT to reduce MACE. It is important to emphasize that in the presence of Left Main disease, or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)/heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), revascularization is often recommended.

1.4.1 Pharmacologic approach

For the management of angina, the initial treatment strategy involves the use of antianginal medications, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCB), or long‐acting nitrates, to alleviate symptoms. If symptoms persist, incorporating an additional antianginal agent from a distinct class, such as ranolazine, is recommended.

Treatment selection is cautioned as "Multivessel PCI should be directed only at lesions that are hemodynamically significant". In survey data, "21% of cardiologists advocated one-stage multivessel PCI, 62% advocated staged PCI, and 17% suggested it to be done only if there was ischemia or symptoms".

### Outcome of elderly patients with chronic symptomatic coronary artery disease with an invasive vs optimized medical treatment strategy: one-year results of the randomized TIME trial [^e8eb00c2]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

The risk-benefit ratio of invasive vs medical management of elderly patients with symptomatic chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear. The Trial of Invasive versus Medical therapy in Elderly patients (TIME) recently showed early benefits in quality of life from invasive therapy in patients aged 75 years or older, although with a certain excess in mortality.

Objective

To assess the long-term value of invasive vs medical management of chronic CAD in elderly adults in terms of quality of life and prevention of major adverse cardiac events.

Design

One-year follow-up analysis of TIME, a prospective randomized trial with enrollment between February 1996 and November 2000.

Setting and Participants

A total of 282 patients with Canadian Cardiac Society class 2 or higher angina despite treatment with 2 or more anti-anginal drugs who survived for the first 6 months after enrollment in TIME (mean age, 80 years [range, 75–91 years]; 42% women), enrolled at 14 centers in Switzerland.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to undergo coronary angiography followed by revascularization (if feasible) (n = 140 surviving 6 months) or to receive optimized medical therapy (n = 142 surviving 6 months).

Main Outcome Measures

Quality of life, assessed by standardized questionnaire; major adverse cardiac events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome) after 1 year.

Results

After 1 year, improvements in angina and quality of life persisted for both therapies compared with baseline, but the early difference favoring invasive therapy disappeared. Among invasive therapy patients, later hospitalization with revascularization was much less likely (10% vs 46%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11–0.32; P < .001). However, 1-year mortality (11.1% for invasive; 8.1% for medical; HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.72–3.16; P = 0.28) and death or nonfatal myocardial infarction rates (17.0% for invasive; 19.6% for medical; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.53–1.53; P = 0.71) were not significantly different. Overall major adverse cardiac event rates were higher for medical patients after 6 months (49.3% vs 19.0% for invasive; P < .001), a difference which increased to 64.2% vs 25.5% after 12 months (P < .001).

Conclusions

In contrast with differences in early results, 1-year outcomes in elderly patients with chronic angina are similar with regard to symptoms, quality of life, and death or nonfatal infarction with invasive vs optimized medical strategies based on this intention-to-treat analysis. The invasive approach carries an early intervention risk, while medical management poses an almost 50% chance of later hospitalization and revascularization.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^3144b4ee]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Revascularization trials including adults ≥ 75 years with stable ischemic heart disease — FREEDOM (2012, 2019) randomized CABG versus PCI in diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease; the 5‑year composite of death from any cause, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke was 26.6% with PCI versus 18.7% with CABG (P = 0.005), all‑cause death at median follow‑up 7.5 years was CABG 13.8% versus PCI 24.3% (P = 0.01), and stroke was more common with CABG 5.2% versus PCI 2.4% (P = 0.03), while CABG favored MI (P < 0.001) and death from any cause (P = 0.049).

### Current concepts on coronary revascularization in diabetic patients [^a46e93bc]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic mellitus (DM) patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are at higher risk of cardiovascular events compared with non-DM individuals. While aggressive cardiovascular prevention and adequate blood glucose control remain cornerstones of therapy, the decision when and how to proceed to coronary revascularization in an individual DM patient should be based on the extent of CAD, ischaemic burden, ventricular function, as well as comorbidities. While in patients with stable symptoms, moderate CAD on coronary angiography and preserved left ventricular function a conservative strategy may be a valuable initial strategy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) an early invasive approach should be favoured. The revascularization strategy for DM patients with complex multivessel CAD should be discussed within a heart team consisting of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and anaesthesiologists. In general, the threshold for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) should be lower for DM than for non-DM individuals. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) and — in the setting of ACS — of potent platelet inhibitors, such as prasugrel or ticagrelor, should be favoured. In the near future, multiple strategies may further favourably impact the prognosis of DM patients undergoing coronary revascularization. These include alternative antiplatelet agents such as thromboxane receptor inhibitors, the broad use of second generation DES, and possibly the implantation of bioresorbable stents. Coronary artery bypass surgery outcomes may also further improve by wide implementation of arterial revascularization, reduction in perioperative stroke by avoiding clamping of the aorta, reduction in wound infection by minimally invasive techniques, and optimization of post-operative medical management.

Second stage necessity in multistage PCI — after treating the primary stenosis, the interventionist must consider whether to proceed to a second stenosis; even if a second stenosis is proven hemodynamically significant by fractional flow reserve (FFR), the clinical need may remain questionable and a rational strategy may be to defer the second PCI to allow reassessment of symptoms and optimization of medical therapy, and a second informed consent process is necessary before proceeding.

### SCAI position statement on optimal percutaneous coronary interventional therapy for complex coronary artery disease [^18f9ff07]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Diabetes and revascularization strategy — CABG versus PCI selection and peri-PCI risks: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the guideline-recommended choice of revascularization in patients with diabetes mellitus presenting with multivessel or left main (LM) CAD and average surgical risk, but some patients have high surgical risk, poor targets, and/or poor conduits and may prefer a percutaneous approach; in such cases, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or a minimally-invasive hybrid revascularization approach may be appropriate. Patients with diabetes who undergo PCI experience higher rates than their nondiabetic counterparts of periprocedural adverse events, in stent restenosis, as well as stent thrombosis, which may occur due to a prothrombotic state, increased resistance to antiplatelet therapies, more diffuse atherosclerosis, and negative vessel remodeling. Additionally, patients with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin and/or with poorly controlled hyperglycemia experience even higher event rates, and to achieve optimal outcomes following revascularization, excellent glycemic control is needed with consideration of newer pharmacotherapies that have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### International study of comparative health effectiveness with medical and invasive approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial: rationale and design [^b3b1448e]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prior trials comparing a strategy of optimal medical therapy with or without revascularization have not shown that revascularization reduces cardiovascular events in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). However, those trials only included participants in whom coronary anatomy was known prior to randomization and did not include sufficient numbers of participants with significant ischemia. It remains unknown whether a routine invasive approach offers incremental value over a conservative approach with catheterization reserved for failure of medical therapy in patients with moderate or severe ischemia.

Methods

The ISCHEMIA trial is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute supported trial, designed to compare an initial invasive or conservative treatment strategy for managing SIHD patients with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. Five thousand one-hundred seventy-nine participants have been randomized. Key exclusion criteria included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min, recent myocardial infarction (MI), left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, left main stenosis > 50%, or unacceptable angina at baseline. Most enrolled participants with normal renal function first underwent blinded coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to exclude those with left main coronary artery disease (CAD) and without obstructive CAD. All randomized participants receive secondary prevention that includes lifestyle advice and pharmacologic interventions referred to as optimal medical therapy (OMT). Participants randomized to the invasive strategy underwent routine cardiac catheterization followed by revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, when feasible, as selected by the local Heart Team to achieve optimal revascularization. Participants randomized to the conservative strategy undergo cardiac catheterization only for failure of OMT. The primary endpoint is a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Assuming the primary endpoint will occur in 16% of the conservative group within 4 years, estimated power exceeds 80% to detect an 18.5% reduction in the primary endpoint. Major secondary endpoints include the composite of CV death and nonfatal MI, net clinical benefit (primary and secondary endpoints combined with stroke), angina-related symptoms and disease-specific quality of life, as well as a cost-effectiveness assessment in North American participants. Ancillary studies of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and those with documented ischemia and non-obstructive coronary artery disease are being conducted concurrently.

Conclusions

ISCHEMIA will provide new scientific evidence regarding whether an invasive management strategy improves clinical outcomes when added to optimal medical therapy in patients with SIHD and moderate or severe ischemia.

### Long-term outcomes of optimized medical management of outpatients with stable coronary artery disease [^7d08ce76]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess long-term clinical outcomes and their correlates in medically managed outpatients with stable angina pectoris, healed myocardial infarction (MI), or documented asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Management strategy emphasized maximally tolerated medical therapy and modification of coronary risk factors. Referral to invasive coronary interventions followed stricter criteria than standard published guidelines. Primary study outcomes were all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary study outcomes included cardiac death, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. A total of 693 men and women with proved CAD (mean age 67 years at entry, 85% men, 41% with history of MI) were enrolled. The annual incidence of nonfatal MI, cardiac mortality, and total mortality was 2.2%, 0.8%, and 1.4%, respectively, during an average follow-up of 4.6 years. Coronary revascularization was performed in 24% of subjects; unstable or progressive anginal symptoms were the most common reasons for revascularization. In patients with documented stable CAD, a management strategy based on intensive medical therapy and modification of established coronary risk factors was associated with excellent long-term outcomes. Thus, coronary interventions can be safely delayed until clinical instability ensues, without increased risk of MI or death. This treatment approach represents a viable alternative to invasive strategies.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f737d4ee]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Coronary artery revascularization in older adults — treatment selection should integrate coronary anatomy, comorbidities, procedural factors, and patient factors, and it is also recommended that patient preferences, cognitive function, and life expectancy be considered through shared decision-making with the patient and support system; important patient factors include comorbidities, frailty, nutritional status, immunocompetence, functional and cognitive status, social support, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) adherence, need for other cardiac procedures, and estimated life expectancy. Calculation of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality is recommended when considering coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); in a 75-year-old with 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), this risk is only 0.034% higher than at age 74 and increases by only 0.328% at age 80. Procedural selection notes that CABG is often more appropriate in multivessel CAD, complex left main stenosis, diabetes, low left ventricular ejection fraction with suitable anatomy, contraindication to DAPT, or severe in-stent restenosis, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often more appropriate in patients with advanced age, reduced life expectancy, or severe left ventricular dysfunction with high surgical risk factors, and in those high-risk older patients, PCI can achieve meaningful symptom relief with lower up-front morbidity risk.

### Revascularization strategy for left main coronary artery disease comparing percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting [^79e32a5a]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is widely prevalent and increasing in frequency. It is estimated that 126 million people worldwide are afflicted with CAD and the prevalence of CAD in the United States is 7.2% for those over the age of 20. Treatment options for severe CAD include medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Numerous factors impact patient prognosis and response to therapy including preoperative comorbidities, and frailty, among others. Coronary anatomy is a significant consideration in identifying the optimal management of CAD. Patients with more complex CAD tend to benefit from CABG while patients with less complex CAD tend to benefit from PCI. Features such vessel occlusion, multivessel CAD, disease at bifurcations, and significant calcium burden are some of the factors that increase disease complexity.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^0abaf1cb]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — top 10 take-home messages (items 1–5) state that treatment decisions regarding coronary revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) should be based on clinical indications, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity, and efforts to reduce disparities of care are warranted; in patients for whom the optimal treatment strategy is unclear, a multidisciplinary Heart Team approach is recommended and treatment decisions should be patient-centered with shared decision-making; for patients with significant left main disease, surgical revascularization is indicated to improve survival relative to medical therapy, while percutaneous revascularization is a reasonable option to improve survival in selected patients with low-to-medium anatomic complexity of CAD and left main disease that is equally suitable for surgical or percutaneous revascularization; for stable ischemic heart disease with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and triple-vessel CAD, surgical revascularization may be reasonable to improve survival and a survival benefit with percutaneous revascularization is uncertain, with decisions based on disease complexity, technical feasibility of treatment, and a Heart Team discussion; and for surgical grafting, use of a radial artery conduit is preferred versus a saphenous vein conduit for the second most important target vessel with significant stenosis after the left anterior descending coronary artery, with benefits including superior patency, reduced adverse cardiac events, and improved survival.

### Variations in coronary revascularization practices and their effect on long-term outcomes [^2e505906]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical and percutaneous procedures are safe and effective methods of revascularization for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Since the 1990s, several studies have demonstrated an increase in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and a decrease in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Annual volumes of both procedures have declined in recent years, possibly because of advances in medical therapy, data questioning the benefit of PCI in stable CAD, and increasing use and scrutiny of appropriateness criteria. Furthermore, results of the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) and FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trials indicated that CABG may offer better outcomes compared with PCI in patients with multivessel CAD, particularly in patients with diabetes or complex CAD. Current guidelines suggest that both strategies are options for stable multivessel CAD, unstable angina, or non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI), with CABG receiving a stronger recommendation than PCI across most clinical scenarios.

The relative distribution of PCI and CABG differs markedly across regions, and the magnitude and reasons for these variations are not well understood. Although patient characteristics (diabetes, comorbidities, life expectancy) are known to influence the choice of revascularization procedure, the impact of physician and institutional factors is poorly understood. To minimize the influence of nonclinical factors in the choice of revascularization strategy, multispecialty guidelines recommend a heart team discussion for patients with multivessel CAD.

The objectives of this population‐based study were to determine (1) the presence and magnitude of variations in the rates of PCI and CABG across institutions in contemporary practice; (2) whether nonclinical factors influence the choice of revascularization; and (3) whether these nonclinical factors are associated with patient outcomes following revascularization.

### The heart team approach to coronary revascularization – have we crossed the lines of evidence-based medicine? [^689784bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine demands considerable time and decision-making skills to navigate through the proliferating data. A hierarchical "pyramid of evidence" has been formulated to help categorize data quality. The hierarchical data are processed into recommendations in Practice Guideline statements. Recently, both American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention embraced a new "heart team approach" as the preferred method to optimize revascularization decision making in cases of complex coronary anatomy. This extrapolation of a research method to the broad clinical practice has potential limitations. We suggest that both the need for a new method to optimize patient triage for the various revascularization strategies and the method to optimize decision making should be discussed. Published data suggest only minor deviations from guideline-based indications. Furthermore, traditional clinical judgment may result in a better patient outcome than arbitrary treatment assignment by rigid set of criteria. In conclusion, the need for a new decision-making process in the choice of revascularization strategy should be further explored and supported by scientific evidence.

### Strategies for multivessel revascularization in patients with diabetes [^65fc626f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

In some randomized trials comparing revascularization strategies for patients with diabetes, coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) has had a better outcome than percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to discover whether aggressive medical therapy and the use of drug-eluting stents could alter the revascularization approach for patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease.

Methods

In this randomized trial, we assigned patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease to undergo either PCI with drug-eluting stents or CABG. The patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (median among survivors, 3.8 years). All patients were prescribed currently recommended medical therapies for the control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

From 2005 through 2010, we enrolled 1900 patients at 140 international centers. The patients' mean age was 63.1 ± 9.1 years, 29% were women, and 83% had three-vessel disease. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the PCI group (P = 0.005), with 5-year rates of 26.6% in the PCI group and 18.7% in the CABG group. The benefit of CABG was driven by differences in rates of both myocardial infarction (P < 0.001) and death from any cause (P = 0.049). Stroke was more frequent in the CABG group, with 5-year rates of 2.4% in the PCI group and 5.2% in the CABG group (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

For patients with diabetes and advanced coronary artery disease, CABG was superior to PCI in that it significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial infarction, with a higher rate of stroke.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — revascularization to improve symptoms states that in patients with refractory angina despite medical therapy and with significant coronary artery stenoses amenable to revascularization, revascularization is recommended to improve symptoms (COR 1, LOE A). In patients with angina but no anatomic or physiological criteria for revascularization, neither CABG nor PCI should be performed (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD). Multiple RCTs have confirmed that revascularization improves anginal symptoms to a greater degree than optimal medical therapy, and inappropriate revascularization of nonobstructive plaques with CABG can lead to progression of underlying CAD, and inappropriate use of PCI can cause periprocedural MI and would not be expected to improve quality of life or anginal symptoms.

### Individualizing revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel Coronary Disease [^62ab80c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), the FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trial demonstrated that, on average, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was superior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and angina reduction. Nonetheless, multivessel PCI remains a common revascularization strategy in the real world.

Objectives

To translate the results of FREEDOM to individual patients in clinical practice, risk models of the heterogeneity of treatment benefit were built.

Methods

Using patient-level data from 1,900 FREEDOM patients, the authors developed models to predict 5-year MACE (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and 1-year angina after CABG and PCI using baseline covariates and treatment interactions. Parsimonious models were created to support clinical use. The models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling, and the MACE model was externally validated in a large real-world registry.

Results

The 5-year MACE occurred in 346 (18.2%) patients, and 310 (16.3%) had angina at 1 year. The MACE model included 8 variables and treatment interactions with smoking status (c = 0.67). External validation in stable CAD (c = 0.65) and ACS (c = 0.68) demonstrated comparable performance. The 6-variable angina model included a treatment interaction with SYNTAX score (c = 0.67). PCI was never superior to CABG, and CABG was superior to PCI for MACE in 54.5% of patients and in 100% of patients with history of smoking.

Conclusions

To help disseminate the results of FREEDOM, the authors created a personalized risk prediction tool for patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD that could be used in shared decision-making for CABG versus PCI by estimating each patient's personal outcomes with both treatments.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications

While the ease and minimal morbidity of PCI have a strong appeal to patients, families, and some physicians, current clinical approaches to the treatment of the diabetic patient with multivessel disease may exceed scientific evidence. The 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology PCI guideline update recommends a "Heart Team" approach, with the implicit understanding that each patient's case takes into account surgical and interventional risks, long‐term outcomes, and patient preferences. Based on the current study, CABG is preferred for the most favorable long‐term outcomes in high‐risk SYNTAX Score patients without high surgical risk. For patients with low‐risk and possibly intermediate‐risk SYNTAX Scores, PCI may be a reasonable primary strategy, given the early increased morbidity from surgery and the higher risk of stroke with comparable long‐term MACE. The preferred strategy in diabetic patients with high surgical risk requires further study.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — mortality effects and subgroup signals: Although earlier studies suggested benefit, the text states that many recent studies and meta-analyses show an overall null effect of revascularization on all-cause death for CCD; contemporary medical-therapy mortality is lower (annualized 4.0% in CAME-2, 1.0% in FAME-2, and 1.6% in ISCHEMIA), and many trials had high crossover and low angiographic complexity. It specifies subgroups with mortality benefit of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) over guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) alone — multivessel disease with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 35%) and left main disease — and reports that STICH showed improved survival at 10 years for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (≤ 35%) treated with CABG plus optimal medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. In contrast, REVIVED-BCIS 2 found that PCI among patients with ejection fraction ≤ 35% did not improve major adverse cardiovascular events (including survival) at a median follow-up of 3.4 years. For left main disease, no recent trials compare revascularization to GDMT alone and most contemporary CCD trials excluded left main disease, so supporting evidence derives mainly from older randomized controlled trials.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with concomitant angina pectoris — patients who have both angina pectoris and HF should be given drugs that relieve angina along with drugs that are appropriate in the management of HF; both nitrates and beta-blockers can improve anginal symptoms and may produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and thus, they are preferred if these conditions coexist, and the decrease in ventricular volume and pressures produced by diuretics may exert independent antianginal effects. Because short-and long-term treatment with these drugs has increased the risk of worsening HF and death in patients with LV dysfunction, most calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with HF, and of available agents, only amlodipine has been shown not to adversely affect survival. In patients with both HF and angina pectoris, strong consideration should be given to the use of coronary revascularization, and coronary artery bypass surgery has been shown to lessen angina and reduce the risk of death in patients who have multivessel disease, reduced LVEF, and stable angina.

### Management of acute coronary syndromes in patients with diabetes: implications of the FREEDOM trial [^33bdb206]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a powerful independent risk factor for multivessel, diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD). The optimal coronary revascularization strategy in DM is not clearly defined, but past trials have suggested an advantage for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Recently, the Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease (FREEDOM) trial found patients randomized to CABG had lower rates of death and myocardial infarction (MI) compared with those randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Objective

This article reviews the contemporary management of patients with DM presenting with acute coronary syndromes, particularly ST-elevation MI, in the post-FREEDOM era.

Methods

We undertook a comprehensive review of published literature addressing trials in this field performed to address current knowledge both in the pre- and post-FREEDOM era.

Results

The implications of FREEDOM for patients with acute coronary syndrome are that CABG provides a significant benefit, compared with PCI with drug-eluting stents, to patients with DM and multivessel coronary artery disease; and that patients similar to those enrolled in FREEDOM should receive CABG in preference to PCI. The relevance of FREEDOM's findings to the large proportion of patients who would not meet inclusion criteria-including patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing an early or emergent invasive strategy, remains uncertain.

Discussion

FREEDOM's outcomes have generated uncertainty regarding best practice once thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow is re-established in patients with DM and multivessel disease. Current interventional guidelines recommend optimally treating the culprit artery; however, decisions made at the time of revascularization influence future revascularization strategies, particularly stent choice and resultant P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy. The preferred method for future revascularization may be questioned if the patient's residual coronary stenoses do not, post-PCI, meet the FREEDOM inclusion criteria, or where the left anterior descending artery is the infarct-related artery, and after left anterior descending artery PCI the patient would not receive an internal mammary graft. The management of residual disease and the preferred (further) revascularization strategy needs to be tested in an appropriately powered randomized trial.

Conclusions

The optimal revascularization strategy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, diabetes, and multivessel disease, in particular those with ST elevation, is unclear, and not guided by level A (or B) evidence. Currently CABG is favored over PCI, and an individually tailored, collaborative approach, guided by a multidisciplinary heart team, should be employed.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^cde923ae]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — initial management of stable stress-test confirmed ischemic heart disease emphasizes that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initial strategy. This recommendation should not apply to those with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction < 35%), or left main stem disease as they were excluded from the definitive trials. The overall certainty of the evidence comparing coronary revascularization with optimal medical therapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT and with heart disease is very low. The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was interestingly not periprocedural). It is not possible to formally assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive medical therapy versus an initial invasive strategy due to mixed findings from the evidence in people with stable ischemic heart disease, and invasive strategies will have higher cost implications to healthcare systems, people with CKD, or both. Access and availability to cardiology services will facilitate implementation of intensive medical therapy. Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasive strategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based on symptoms, and intensive medical therapy is a suitable approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or without CKD. Trials in CKD have not ruled out antianginal benefits in people with CKD (despite negative findings), and in CKD, the antianginal benefits of an initially invasive approach have not been demonstrated.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^fbeab779]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Stable ischemic heart disease — revascularization versus medical therapy in adults ≥ 75 years is informed by randomized data from TIME and ISCHEMIA. In TIME, 305 patients ≥ 75 years of age with stable angina on ≥ 2 antianginal medications from 1996 to 2000 were randomized to invasive evaluation with revascularization versus optimal medical therapy; of those catheterized, 79 underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and 20 received CABG. At 6 months, invasive management reduced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) versus medical therapy (19% versus 49%; P < 0.0001), and although angina and Qol benefits persisted to 1 year, MACEs at 1 year also favored the invasive approach (25.5% versus 64.2%; P < 0.001). In ISCHEMIA, there was no significant difference in composite MACE between invasive and medical strategies among 5179 participants, but symptoms improved with the invasive strategy; ISCHEMIA enrolled 865 adults ≥ 75 years of age, and there was a significant age interaction for the Seattle Angina Questionnaire Summary Score (P for interaction = 0.008), with older adults tending to have less improvement in angina-related health status with invasive management with consistent improvement in angina frequency.

Left ventricular dysfunction and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) — the STICH trial randomized patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 35%) to either CABG with medical therapy or medical therapy alone and initially showed no survival benefit over a median follow-up of 5 years, but at long-term follow-up at 10 years reported a survival benefit of CABG; myocardial viability testing had no relevance to study outcomes and was not standardized. Subgroup analyses and a meta-analysis indicate that patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a significant survival benefit with CABG, particularly with accompanying triple-vessel disease. There are insufficient data to make recommendations for using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in this patient population, and the use of PCI in this patient population requires more study.

- left main disease with stenosis > 50%

- proximal left anterior descending stenosis > 50%

- 2- or 3-vessel disease with stenosis > 50% with impaired LV function - LVEF ≤ 35%

- large area of ischemia detected by functional testing - > 10% LV - or abnormal invasive FFR

1.4.2 Revascularization approach

While historical studies implied that surgical revascularization could improve survival rates for patients with CCD, recent studies and comprehensive reviews have largely found no substantial impact of such procedures on reducing all‐cause mortality in CCD patients. A meta‐analysis of randomized trials showed an annualized mortality rate in the medical therapy arm, ACME‐2 (Angioplasty Compared to Medicine: Two‐Vessel Disease) has reported 4.0%, while 1.0% in medical therapy arm of later studies like FAME‐2 (Fractional Flow Reserve Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Plus Optimal Medical Treatment [OMT] vs. OMT), signifying progress in medical management.

The 2023 CCD Guideline, similar to the previous 2021 Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization, emphasizes the importance of informed decisions regarding revascularization. There should be a comprehensive, team‐based approach, the guidelines advocate for the involvement of a Heart Team, including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and other cardiovascular specialists to improve patient outcomes. This team plays a fundamental role in devising revascularization strategies that are tailored to individual patient profiles, especially those with complex coronary or multivessel diseases and other significant comorbidities.

The principle of patient‐centered care is also emphasized. Treatment decisions should reflect the best clinical evidence and align with patients' values, preferences, and goals, reinforcing the practice of shared decision‐making. The 2023 CCD Guideline recommends that for patients with persistent angina that limits their lifestyle despite optimal medical therapy with a disease burden that is amenable to revascularization, revascularization should be an attempt to alleviate symptoms.

1.5 Beta blockers

Prior guidelines have advocated for extended duration of beta‐blocker therapy, especially post‐MI or ACS and continued for 3 years and in CCD. However, a major shift in the guidelines now recommends re‐evaluating the indication for beta‐blockers 1 year after a myocardial event, given the mixed evidence on their long‐term efficacy, possibility of side effects like fatigue and depression, along with possible drug interactions (COR2b). Ongoing beta‐blocker therapy is now specifically indicated only for patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 50%), presenting with angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, or who have experienced spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Beta‐blockers are generally not recommended for CCD patients receiving elective PCI, those without prior MI, or those with LVEF above 50%.

Clinical terms used in the consensus recommendation

ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined somewhat differently across trials; however, all the CVOTs overall had similar inclusion criteria. These criteria generally included a history of any of the conditions mentioned hereafter: acute coronary syndrome or MI, stable or unstable angina, CAD with or without revascularization, any other arterial revascularization, peripheral artery disease, stroke assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. The relevant conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis consisted of transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised for unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class II–III, arterial stenosis of more than 50%, symptomatic/asymptomatic CAD documented by imaging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Certain trials had included few patients without clinical ASCVD but required them to have a high burden of risk factors based on age and the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors.

MACE

In this document, three major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered as primary endpoints in the CVOTs:
3-point MACE: composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality.
4-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina.
5-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) or unstable angina.

High risk of CVD

Patients with high risk for CVD included multiple risk factors for CV disease: men 55 years of age or older or women 60 years of age or older in addition to another traditional risk factor like hypertension, dyslipidemia (defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L]) or the use of lipid-lowering therapies, and smoking. Furthermore, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) higher than 30 mg/g or equivalent]; high renal risk, which included (a) eGFR of 45–75 mL/min/1.73 m² and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or (b) eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m² regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) or requiring maintenance dialysis, history of CAD; stroke or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.

### Staging of multivessel percutaneous coronary interventions: an expert consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^898a843c]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Medium credibility.

Methods of determining significance of coronary disease — Angiographic percentage stenosis is a notorious source of variability, and because PCI of nonsignificant lesions does not decrease major adverse events or improve symptoms, functional tests should be used to decide whether PCI is warranted for angiographically stable, intermediate severity (50–70%) lesions. For physiologic assessment, an fractional flow reserve (FFR) of < 0.75 correlates well with ischemia on stress testing; for patients with an FFR between 0.75 and 0.80, angina at follow-up was less prevalent after PCI than with conservative management; and an FFR of > 0.75 or > 0.80 correlates with excellent long-term outcomes if PCI is deferred.

### Appropriate coronary artery bypass grafting use in the percutaneous coronary intervention era: are we finally making progress? [^822aa079]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Appropriate use criteria integrate guidelines, clinical trial evidence, and expert opinion in order to determine the most appropriate care for a range of distinct clinical scenarios. Inappropriate use estimates cannot be neglected. Approximately 12%-14% of all percutaneous coronary interventions and 1%-2% of all coronary artery bypass grafting procedures in patients with stable angina are deemed inappropriate. Several reasons for this difference are identified. Continuous improvement of the criteria, multidisciplinary discussions, and the correct financial incentives will be essential in reducing the number of inappropriate procedures, improve patient outcomes, and contain costs.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on coronary artery disease:

- **Definition**: CAD, also known as chronic coronary disease, is a disorder characterized by a reduction in blood flow to the myocardium caused by formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries.
- Pathophysiology: The process leading to the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries can be divided into 5 key steps: endothelial dysfunction, formation of lipid layer or fatty streak within the intima, induction of innate inflammatory reaction with migration of leukocytes and smooth muscle cells into the vessel wall, foam cell formation from macrophages engulfing lipoprotein particles, and proliferation of extracellular matrix. Coronary collateral circulation may develop to provide an alternative blood supply to the myocardium.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of CAD in adults aged ≥ 40 years in the US is estimated at 8.0%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CAD include male sex, advanced age, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, physical inactivity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heavy drinking, and a family history of atherothrombotic CVDs. CKD, autoimmune diseases, cerebrovascular and vascular diseases have also been associated with an increased risk of CAD.
- **Disease course**: CAD is often asymptomatic early in the course, but can present with chronic, gradually worsening chest pain, stable angina, ischemic cardiomyopathy, or as ACSs (unstable angina and myocardial infarction) or SCD. Other symptoms may include dyspnea, exercise intolerance, fatigue, nausea, diaphoresis, or pain in the left arm, jaw, neck, upper back, or upper abdomen.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic coronary disease is the leading cause of death in the US and worldwide, with a mortality rate of 210.9 per 100,000 population in the US. The survival rates for CAD after PCI and CABG vary depending on patient characteristics and disease specifics. Generally, CABG shows a survival advantage, particularly in patients with multivessel disease or diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk pathway — definitions and endpoints are specified as follows: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined as a history of an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary heart disease with or without revascularization, other arterial revascularization, stroke, or peripheral artery disease assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. Cardiovascular (CV) disease includes ASCVD, HF, and CV-related death. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a clinical diagnosis marked by a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the presence of albuminuria, or both in a patient with diabetes. Heart failure (HF) is defined per criteria outlined in referenced ACC/AHA documents, and an HF event, including hospitalization, is defined by the 2014 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular Endpoint Events in Clinical Trials. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is defined as clinical diagnosis of HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. High risk for ASCVD includes patients with end organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy or retinopathy, or multiple risk factors (e.g., age, hypertension, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia). Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) is either a "3-point MACE" composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death or a "4- point MACE" composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or CV death.

Revascularization for CAD — synopsis of evidence: Compared with optimal medical management alone, CABG surgery plus GDMT did not reduce the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at a median of 56 months; however, at 10 years' follow-up, CABG+GDMT resulted in significant reductions in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and death from any cause or cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with LVEF ≤ 35% and ischemic cardiomyopathy. A retrospective analysis showed significant reductions in first and recurrent all-cause, cardiovascular, and HF hospitalizations at 10 years in patients receiving CABG+ optimal medical therapy compared with optimal medical therapy alone. Similar benefits from percutaneous coronary intervention revascularization in this cohort have not yet been shown in an RCT, and recent data continue to show a benefit of CABG over percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with diabetes, CAD, and LV dysfunction and in patients with left main CAD and moderate or severe LV dysfunction.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite improvement in the management of patients with stable CAD, diabetes remains a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality. There is no conclusive evidence that either modality is better than medical therapy alone for the treatment of stable multivessel CAD in patients with diabetes in a very long-term follow-up. Our aim was to compare 3 therapeutic strategies for stable multivessel CAD in a diabetic population and non-diabetic population.

Methods

It was compared medical therapy (MT), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 232 diabetic patients and 379 nondiabetic patients with multivessel CAD. Endpoints evaluated were overall and cardiac mortality.

Results

Patients (n = 611) were randomized to CABG (n = 203), PCI (n = 205), or MT (n = 203). In a 10-year follow-up, more deaths occurred among patients with diabetes than among patients without diabetes (P = 0.001) for overall mortality. In this follow-up, 10-year mortality rates were 32.3% and 23.2% for diabetics and non-diabetics respectively (P = 0.024). Regarding cardiac mortality, 10-year cardiac mortality rates were 19.4% and 12.7% respectively (P = 0.031). Considering only diabetic patients and stratifying this population by treatment option, we found mortality rates of 31.3% for PCI, 27.5% for CABG and 37.5% for MT (P = 0.015 for CABG vs MT) and cardiac mortality rates of 18.8%, 12.5% and 26.1% respectively (P = 0.005 for CABG vs MT).

Conclusions/Interpretation

Among patients with stable multivessel CAD and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, the 3 therapeutic regimens had high rates of overall and cardiac-related deaths among diabetic compared with non-diabetic patients. Moreover, better outcomes were observed in diabetic patients undergoing CABG compared to MT in relation to overall and cardiac mortality in a 10-year follow-up.

Coronary revascularization — recommendation-specific supportive text emphasizes that shared decision-making is vital to patient-centered care, noting benefits and barriers, and sets expectations for consent discussions: Shared decision-making is vital to patient-centered care and improves understanding, expectations, engagement, and value concordance; factors complicating effective shared decision-making include low health literacy, adverse social determinants of health, cultural beliefs, language barriers, advanced age, and complex comorbidities; incorporating a patient's preferences improves well-being through better adherence and satisfaction; a patient's right to decline recommended treatments must be respected and should be acknowledged in a written document after the patient has received sufficient information from the Heart Team; patients cannot engage in shared decision making until they know the potential benefits and risks of all treatment options, and clinicians must provide evidence-based estimates of risks, benefits, and costs of therapeutic options; procedure-related and long-term risks and benefits, such as survival, quality of life, and the need for late reintervention, should be included, and patients should also be educated about the need for continued medical therapy with or without revascularization, as well as lifestyle modification and other secondary prevention strategies; in some situations, in which the optimal treatment strategy is uncertain, it may be appropriate to defer revascularization to allow time for consultation and discussion; and the clinician must act in the patient's best interest and convey the risks and benefits of all revascularization treatment options, consult with additional specialists when appropriate, and allow the patient to consult family.

Murphy SP, Ibrahim NE, Januzzi JL. Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Review. JAMA. 2020; 324: 488–504. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2020. 10262 Importance Worldwide, the burden of heart failure has increased to an estimated 23 million people, and approximately 50% of cases are HF with reduced ejection fraction. Observations Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea or exertional limitation due to impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood or both. HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography.

Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF.

Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology. Conclusions and Relevance HFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies. Disease morbidity and mortality remain high, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% after hospitalization for HFrEF.
