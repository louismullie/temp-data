## Question

Community acquired pneumonia contagious

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is contagious and how to think about transmission risk in practical terms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CAP is and which pathogens cause it. Then, I should verify which of those pathogens are transmissible person-to-person. Next, I will examine how contagiousness varies by pathogen and host factors. After that, I need to check what major guidelines say about transmission risk and infection control. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically useful answer and outline practical precautions and special scenarios that change risk, like influenza coinfection or immunocompromise [^116J1GrF] [^117F8r49].

> Let me first confirm the definition and etiologic spectrum so I don't jump to conclusions. CAP is an acute lung infection acquired outside healthcare settings, and the causative agents include bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, atypicals like Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses including influenza, RSV, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and others; importantly, no organism is identified in more than half of cases, which complicates transmission counseling [^115EfGbk].

> Now, I should verify which of these are actually transmissible from person to person. Respiratory viruses spread readily via respiratory droplets and contact, and atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma and Chlamydia are classically transmitted person-to-person through close contact with respiratory secretions, whereas pneumococcus and H. influenzae colonize the upper airway and can be transmitted, though they are less efficiently spread than many viruses; hold on, I should double-check that I'm not overstating pneumococcal contagion — yes, colonization dynamics and crowding increase risk, but person-to-person spread is less consistent than for viral etiologies [^1119QypK] [^1166ytmg].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about "contagiousness" versus "infectiousness". CAP itself is not a single contagious entity; rather, patients with CAP can be contagious to varying degrees depending on the pathogen and timing. Viral CAP tends to be more contagious early in illness, particularly influenza and RSV, and coinfection with viruses predisposes to secondary bacterial pneumonia, which can prolong the period of communicability; I should confirm that coinfection worsens outcomes and complicates transmission risk — yes, viral-bacterial coinfections are common and associated with worse clinical trajectories, reinforcing the need for early infection control in suspected viral CAP [^116J1GrF] [^116vXYfv].

> Next, I should review what authoritative sources say about transmission risk. The NEJM primer and Lancet reviews emphasize the broad pathogen spectrum and the frequency of unidentified causes, but they do not characterize CAP as uniformly highly contagious; instead, they focus on diagnosis, severity, and treatment, implying that transmission risk is pathogen- and context-dependent rather than a fixed property of "CAP". Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline explicitly states a blanket contagion risk — none do, which supports a nuanced, pathogen-specific approach to transmission counseling [^notfound].

> I will now examine host and environmental modifiers of risk. Crowded settings such as military barracks, college dormitories, and long-term care facilities facilitate outbreaks of organisms like Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma, and immunocompromised hosts may shed pathogens longer; let me consider pediatric implications too — children often have viral CAP and can transmit viruses efficiently within households, so family precautions are prudent during the acute phase [^1166ytmg] [^1119QypK].

> Let me synthesize the answer carefully. Yes, CAP can be contagious, but the degree of contagiousness is highly variable and depends on the causative pathogen, timing of illness, and host factors. Viral CAP is generally more contagious early in disease, atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma and Chlamydia are transmissible via close contact, and typical bacteria such as pneumococcus have lower but nonzero transmission efficiency; because the etiology is often unknown at presentation, it is reasonable to apply standard respiratory hygiene precautions during the acute symptomatic period, especially for viral symptoms or known outbreaks [^1119QypK] [^1166ytmg] [^116J1GrF].

> I should confirm practical precautions that align with evidence and guidelines. During the acute phase, use respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, and consider masking in shared indoor spaces; if influenza is suspected or confirmed, treat with antivirals promptly and maintain precautions, as early therapy and isolation reduce transmission; for hospitalized patients with severe CAP, follow standard infection prevention practices and escalate to droplet precautions when influenza or other highly transmissible viruses are suspected; in pediatrics, limit exposure during the acute illness and reinforce vaccination to reduce future transmission risk [^116xYNzB] [^117PBJPB] [^116nFbVE].

> But wait, what about special scenarios that change risk or duration of contagion. Influenza coinfection can extend the period of communicability and increase severity, so I need to ensure early antiviral therapy and appropriate bacterial coverage when indicated; travel-associated or outbreak-linked pathogens like Legionella or SARS-CoV warrant specific epidemiologic screening and public health measures; and in immunocompromised hosts, both the likelihood of atypical pathogens and the duration of shedding may be greater, so I should tailor precautions accordingly and involve infection control early [^116J1GrF] [^112rDbg4] [^111GMRRN] [^117F8r49].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line is precise. CAP is potentially contagious, with the highest transmission risk from respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria, moderate and variable risk from typical bacteria, and risk modified by timing, crowding, and immune status; because the cause is often unknown initially, apply standard respiratory hygiene and pathogen-specific precautions during the acute illness, and escalate control measures when influenza or outbreaks are suspected, aligning with contemporary CAP management principles and public health guidance [^1166ytmg] [^116xYNzB].

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is **contagious** because it is caused by infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi) that can spread via respiratory droplets, aerosols, or close contact [^1119QypK]. The **risk of transmission is highest early in illness**, especially with coughing or sneezing, and varies by pathogen and host factors [^notfound]. Transmission is reduced by hand hygiene, masking, and avoiding close contact; **isolation is not routinely required** but may be used in severe or outbreak settings. Preventive measures include vaccination, smoking cessation, and infection control practices [^1173MLCC] [^1166ytmg].

---

## Pathogens responsible for CAP and their contagiousness

CAP is caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The **contagiousness of CAP depends on the specific pathogen involved**:

| **Pathogen category** | **Examples** | **Contagiousness** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacteria | - Streptococcus pneumoniae <br/> - Haemophilus influenzae <br/> - Mycoplasma pneumoniae <br/> - Chlamydia pneumoniae | - Moderately contagious <br/> - Spread via respiratory droplets or close contact [^1119QypK] |
| Viruses | - Influenza virus <br/> - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <br/> - Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) <br/> - Rhinovirus <br/> - Adenovirus | - Highly contagious <br/> - Spread via respiratory droplets, aerosols, and contact with contaminated surfaces [^notfound] |
| Fungi | - Histoplasma capsulatum <br/> - Coccidioides immitis <br/> - Cryptococcus neoformans | - Not typically contagious person-to-person <br/> - Environmental exposure is the primary route of transmission [^notfound] |

---

## Modes of transmission

CAP primarily spreads through the following **modes of transmission**:

- **Respiratory droplets**: Coughing, sneezing, or talking releases droplets containing infectious agents, which can be inhaled by others [^notfound].

- **Aerosol transmission**: Certain pathogens, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, can remain suspended in the air and be inhaled over longer distances [^notfound].

- **Close contact**: Physical proximity or contact with infected individuals increases the risk of transmission, particularly for bacterial pathogens like Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae [^1119QypK].

- **Contaminated surfaces**: Touching surfaces contaminated with respiratory secretions and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes can facilitate transmission [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing contagiousness

Several factors influence the **contagiousness of CAP**:

- **Pathogen type**: Viral pathogens are generally more contagious than bacterial pathogens, with fungi being the least contagious [^notfound].

- **Stage of illness**: Early stages of infection, particularly during the acute phase, are associated with higher contagiousness [^notfound].

- **Host factors**: Immunocompromised individuals, elderly patients, and those with chronic respiratory conditions are more susceptible to infection and may shed pathogens for longer periods, increasing contagiousness [^1173MLCC].

- **Environmental factors**: Crowded or enclosed spaces facilitate transmission, especially for airborne pathogens [^1166ytmg].

---

## Preventive measures and infection control

To reduce the **risk of transmission of CAP**, the following preventive measures are recommended:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers [^1166ytmg].

- **Respiratory hygiene**: Covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues, and disposing of them properly [^notfound].

- **Masking**: Wearing masks, particularly in crowded or healthcare settings, can reduce droplet and aerosol transmission [^notfound].

- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risk of CAP and its transmission [^11287jfv].

- **Isolation**: In severe cases or outbreaks, temporary isolation of infected individuals may be necessary to prevent spread [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and infection control measures** to manage CAP effectively and reduce transmission risk [^notfound]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend:

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Based on patient-specific factors, severity of illness, and local epidemiology [^115WEwym].

- **Microbiological testing**: Particularly in severe cases or when drug-resistant pathogens are suspected [^115WEwym].

- **Infection control practices**: Hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in healthcare settings [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

CAP is **contagious**, with transmission risk varying by pathogen, illness stage, and host and environmental factors. Effective infection control — hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, masking, and vaccination — reduces transmission risk, and clinical guidelines support early diagnosis, appropriate therapy, and infection control to limit spread [^1166ytmg].

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis with a significant impact on healthcare management around the world, with the highest morbidity and mortality of all of the forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with severe pneumonia usually require intensive care unit management, including vasopressors or mechanical ventilation. Early clinical suspicion and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapies are mandatory in patients with severe pneumonia. A number of recent studies and guidelines addressing these issues have been published, and they will be reviewed in this article.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111VGRXt]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the northern hemisphere about 12/1000 people a year (on average) contract pneumonia while living in the community, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mortality ranges from about 5% to 35% depending on severity of disease, with a worse prognosis in older people, men, and people with chronic diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent community-acquired pneumonia? What are the effects of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient settings, in people admitted to hospital, and in people receiving intensive care? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, intravenous), different combinations, and prompt administration of antibiotics in intensive-care settings, early mobilisation, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine.

### What is the role of respiratory viruses in community-acquired pneumonia? what is the best therapy for influenza and other viral causes of community-acquired pneumonia? [^116vXYfv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory viruses have long been appreciated as a cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly among children, people with serious medical comorbidities, and military recruits. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP among adults. Polymerase chain reaction-based testing has allowed detection of newer agents and improved the ability to detect such viral infections as influenza virus and rhinovirus. Coinfection with viruses and bacteria is common and it remains challenging to determine which patients have only viral infection as the cause of CAP. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP and to integrate detection into management, and better treatment options for noninfluenza respiratory viral infections are needed.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115kRUbx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major global health challenge that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including older people, immunocompromised people, those with chronic conditions, and young children. Once considered solely an acute illness, community-acquired pneumonia is now recognised as a disease with long-term complications, including cardiovascular events, respiratory impairment, and cognitive decline. Advances, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and the broader availability of point-of-care lung ultrasound, allow for rapid pathogen detection and personalised treatment. However, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the role of NAATs, lung ultrasounds, and serum biomarkers in clinical practice. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of community-acquired pneumonia treatment, but the roles of adjunctive therapies, including corticosteroids and immunomodulators, remain incompletely defined. Comprehensive community-acquired pneumonia management emphasises personalised treatment, rehabilitation after the acute episode, routine cardiovascular screening, and strengthening preventive measures, such as vaccination. As precision medicine advances, integrating diagnostics and tailored therapies will improve outcomes and reduce the global burden of community-acquired pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^11287jfv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can be prevented through vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Diagnosis requires suggestive history and physical findings in conjunction with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. Laboratory testing can help guide therapy. Important issues in treatment include choosing the proper venue, timely initiation of the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral, appropriate respiratory support, deescalation after negative culture results, switching to oral therapy, and short treatment duration.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review and recent advances [^117EVPwe]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2007). Low credibility.

In the beginning of this 21st century, community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) are still responsible for a significant number of deaths among young children in many developing countries. Public health initiatives such as those proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the management of CAP by means of identifying highly predictable signs and symptoms have had great positive impact in some communities. Still, this approach induces an overdiagnosis and overtreatment of CAP in children below the age of 5 years due to the misclassification of pneumonia in children with fast breathing associated with viral bronchiolitis. Even among children of developed countries, CAP is an important public health problem and many aspects of current diagnostic and management measures are discussed here. In this article, we review the epidemiology and basic concepts of CAP and update current information on clinical evaluation and management of the disease.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia [^1163DYDw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. It accounts for 500,000 hospitalizations and 45,000 deaths each year, and it represents one of the most common causes of ICU admission. The mortality rate due to severe CAP has shown little improvement over the past few years, with rates as high as 58% when patients were admitted to the ICU. Significant interest has focused on the sickest patients who have pneumonia treated in the ICU, regarding identification of need for ICU admission and therapies directed to improve outcomes in patients who have severe CAP. This article reviews epidemiologic, microbiologic, therapeutic, preventive, and outcomes data in patients who have CAP in the ICU.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: what's in a name? [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Formerly, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered as having the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we describe the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and whether a differentiation based on these definitions reflects variation in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches and treatment.

Recent Findings

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality; patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed as having severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host-factors, such as genetic factors and underlying diseases, can influence severity of presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. Distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe disease forms is comparable. Initial antibiotic therapy in patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delay is associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies also suggested an additional benefit of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. As a result, initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci to prevent episodes of severe disease is yet unknown.

Summary

As current guidelines do not adequately identify patients with high risk of mortality and intensive care unit admittance, clinical judgment remains important. Based on distribution of pathogens, investigational procedures and therapy recommended in recent guidelines, differentiation between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia does not seem useful. Whether atypical coverage indeed has additional value in non-severe or pneumococcal CAP, however, remains to be determined. In addition, the preventive benefit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for development of SCAP awaits further evidence.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia? [^116L3Dg2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and promotes reduction of adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improved patient compliance.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7–14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115EfGbk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on community-acquired pneumonia:

- Definition: CAP is an acute infection of the lungs occurring in an individual who has had little contact with the healthcare system.
- Pathophysiology: Common causes of CAP include bacterial infections (such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus) and respiratory viruses (such as influenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus). No causative organism is identified in over 50% of patients.
- Epidemiology: In the US, the incidence of CAP is estimated at 248 cases per 100,000 person-years. In adults ≥ 65 years of age, the incidence increases to 630–1640 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: The most common complications of CAP include parapneumonic effusion and empyema, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Influenza and bacterial pneumonia are strongly associated with cardiac events including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and HF. Other pathogen-specific complications include Streptococcus pneumonia-associated HUS, rhabdomyolysis and AKI often seen in Legionella pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia-induced rash and mucositis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like), and reactive arthritis after Chlamydia pneumonia. CAP can be classified by severity and setting of care. Nonsevere pneumonia typically presents without signs of respiratory failure or sepsis and is managed in the outpatient or general hospital ward setting. Severe pneumonia is characterized by clinical features, such as respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, uremia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, or hypotension requiring fluids. Non-ICU pneumonia refers to hospitalized patients who do not require intensive care, while ICU pneumonia involves patients with acute respiratory failure or septic shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: In patients requiring hospitalization, CAP is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of 11%.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: severity of illness evaluation [^115K1Fys]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Severity-of-illness assessment is now an accepted part of clinical practice and clinical research for the management of adults who have community-acquired pneumonia. Several approaches to this issue have been devised based on severity-of-illness scores or rules, some related to site of management. No single approach has been found to be superior to others, but further research into their effect on outcome in clinical practice is required. It is likely that different approaches may suit different populations and health care systems.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia [^117RULre]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. In particular, pulmonary infections acquired in the community, and pneumonias arising in the hospital setting, represent a major medical and economic problem and thus a continuous challenge to health care. For the radiologist, it is important to understand that community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP) share a number of characteristics, but should, in many respects be regarded as separate entities. CAP and NP arise in different populations, host different spectra of causative pathogens, and pose different challenges to both the clinician and the radiologist. CAP is generally seen in outpatients, is most frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydia, and its radiologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. NP, in contrast, develops in the hospital setting, is commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and may generate substantial problems for the radiologist. Overall, both for CAP and NP, imaging is an integral component of the diagnosis, important for classification and differential diagnosis, and helpful for follow-up.

### Laboratory diagnosis of four recent sporadic cases of community-acquired SARS, guangdong province, China [^111GMRRN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In November 2002, cases of a highly contagious and severe atypical pneumonia were identified in Guangdong Province in southern China. By March 2003, the infection had spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. Designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak was subsequently linked to infection with a previously unrecognized coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The outbreak ended with the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement on July 5, 2003, that the last patient had recovered and the human chain of SARS transmission was broken. In all, 29 countries reported to WHO > 8,000 SARS cases with 774 deaths.

Since WHO's declaration of the end of the SARS epidemic, 17 cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection have been reported. Infections in 13 patients were associated with laboratories: 6 exposed while working in the laboratory and 7 contacts of a patient with a laboratory-acquired case. The other four cases were acquired in the community. On December 26, the Chinese Ministry of Health informed WHO of the first case of community-acquired SARS in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong Province. This case was rapidly followed by reports of three additional cases, all linked to a region in Guangzhou. Although none of these cases was fatal or resulted in documented secondary transmission, they demonstrate that community-acquired infection with SARS-CoV, and potential reemergence of SARS leading to epidemic spread, remains a possibility. These cases also highlight some issues associated with diagnosing and confirming the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. In this report, we describe the laboratory diagnosis and associated confirmation of SARS-CoV infection for these four cases.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113tR9LR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in pregnancy [^114Cc6z4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease worldwide, with considerable morbidity and mortality. In the United States, pneumonia complicates 0.5 to 1.5 per 1,000 pregnancies. Physiologic adaptations in the respiratory and immunologic systems may increase susceptibility to pulmonary infections as well as alter their clinical course. Bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens all cause pneumonia in pregnancy, although the causative agent is identified in only 40–60% of cases. The most common single pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is identified in 15–20% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in pregnancy. Recent recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society on the management of community-acquired pneumonia address diagnostic techniques and management schemes for bacterial and viral pneumonias. These guidelines are discussed in the setting of the pregnant woman with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Viral respiratory infections: a cause of community-acquired pneumonia or a predisposing factor? [^116J1GrF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A cause for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is only identified in ∼50% of cases. Nasopharyngeal PCR panels contain more viruses than previously. The problem then becomes determining the relevance of the organisms identified rather than figuring out which virus is present. This review addresses how to distinguish between viral CAP and bacterial CAP, how viral CAP predisposes to bacterial CAP and some novel antiviral treatment being conducted.

Recent Findings

The pneumonia severity index has been studied in patients with viral CAP. There are new studies using biomarkers to help determine when antimicrobial treatment is needed in CAP patients, and there is still no consensus. Newer devices are being invented in an effort to separate upper from lower respiratory organisms to make test results more relevant. Several outcome studies in patients with viral CAP are reviewed.

Summary

In addition to clinical correlation, using biomarkers can be useful to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP. Outcomes in patients with a co-infection are generally worse as a viral infection may predispose someone to a bacterial pneumonia. Influenza CAP treatment may be initially accompanied with antimicrobials until a patient's diagnosis is clear (∼48–72h). Future research is being conducted for antiviral treatment more than for influenza.

### Long-term prognosis in community-acquired pneumonia [^1169x1P3]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia is considered the leading infectious diseases cause of death and the seventh leading cause of death overall in the US. There is significant interest in understanding the relationship between community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and mortality.

Recent Findings

Most clinical studies examining patients with CAP have used an arbitrary in-hospital or 30-day mortality as a short-term mortality clinical end point. However, long-term mortality (arbitrary > 3 months) factors, incidence, prediction, and implications on patient care are important issues that require further evaluation in patients with CAP. This review focuses on the most recent literature assessing the importance and the frequency of long-term associated outcomes in patients with CAP, the risk factors, and possible implications for future strategies. Multiple risk factors that include age, sex, comorbid conditions, type of pneumonia, and severity of illness are associated with higher long-term mortality. In addition, several biomarkers were demonstrated to be independently associated with long-term mortality.

Summary

Despite advances in the understanding of long-term mortality among CAP patients, there is still a high unacceptable long-term mortality. Public health programs should address this important gap, considering the high level of complexity factors in patients with CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia mortality trends according to age and gender: 2009 to 2019 [^113UtiD9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a common cause of infection and Hospital admission, with a high burden of morbidity and mortality, although significant regional variations are usually noted.

Despite the advances in CAP treatment and prevention (mostly related to vaccines against Influenza virus and invasive pneumococcal disease), at least 17% of patients with CAP still require hospitalization, and those with non-resolving CAP may experience a more than 5 -fold increase in the risk of death.

There are considerable differences in the characteristics of patients hospitalized with CAP, especially regarding the prevalence of comorbidities that may increase the incidence of CAP, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, age remains the main factor associated with CAP incidence and mortality.

Accordingly, older patients have CAP more often, which may translate into a prolonged Hospital length of stay, high bacteremia incidence, and mortality. Risk factors for CAP, prevention strategies, and therapeutic priorities of older patients may differ from those of the young, which should inform clinical practice. Escalating the level of care and increasing efforts to identify CAP etiology have been proposed to help decrease mortality for this group.

In this study, we address the incidence and mortality of CAP and their trends for 10 years, for different groups of patients, according to gender and age group, to evaluate their differences throughout this period and to provide data to guide prevention and treatment strategies.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^112uxY2h]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious disease cause of death. We summarize recent findings regarding the epidemiology of CAP in adults, efficacy of vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, diagnostics, and discuss the current controversy between CAP and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

Recent Findings

The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the avian influenza A strain H7N9 are of concern but still these are infrequent causes of CAP. Recent data indicate that vaccinating children also protects adults against CAP by generating significant herd immunity, and that the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in adults may offer some efficacy in preventing CAP caused by vaccine serotypes. The immunochromotagraphic urinary antigen test has improved the diagnostic yield for the aetiology of CAP, and initial data demonstrate that a novel multiplex urinary antigen test will further increase the sensitivity for detection of S. pneumoniae. There has been significant concern that a relatively recently described pneumonia category, HCAP, requires empirical treatment for potentially multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). However, new evidence shows that (at least in Europe) pneumonia caused by MDRO remains uncommon even in HCAP category patients.

Summary

CAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Advances in vaccination and diagnosis should help reduce the amount of disease due to S. pneumoniae, the commonest cause of CAP. Outside of the United States, MDRO are relatively uncommon causes of CAP, and the increased mortality of HCAP category patients seems to be related to their comorbidities and age rather than microbial aetiology.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It puts an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. In addition, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and community-acquired pneumonia: an evolving relationship [^113ThSB3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not a reportable disease, and therefore accurate figures are not available. Data from the United States suggest that there are > 4 million cases per year, resulting in > 600 000 hospitalizations, 64 million days of restricted activity, and 50 000 deaths annually. The overall yearly cost associated with CAP in the United States is estimated to be $9–$10 billion dollars.

CAP is often misdiagnosed and improperly treated. When confronted with a patient with possible CAP, there are 2 questions to be answered. First, is the clinical syndrome in fact pneumonia or some other clinical entity? Second, if CAP, what is the etiologic pathogen? The diagnosis of pneumonia itself is based on a compatible history and the presence of select clinical features plus a chest radiographic abnormality.

The lack of rapid, sensitive, and specific methods to determine the etiologic agent in a particular patient means that the attending physician must often initiate antimicrobial treatment without knowing the pathogen with any degree of certainty. Given the large number of potential pathogens including bacteria, atypical bacteria, and viruses, uncertainty regarding etiology represents a significant problem, particularly for patients ill enough to require admission to hospital. For those requiring management in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, correct initial selection of an antimicrobial regimen assumes critical importance because of the high mortality rates seen in such cases.

Although it was clear that MRSA was becoming an important pathogen in cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, it is currently considered to be the etiologic agent in 20%–40% of such cases. As might be expected, the situation seemed to be quite different for CAP; S. aureus was thought to be quite uncommon, typically occurring as a superinfection in patients with influenza and overall accounting for infection in only 1%–5% of all CAP patients.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Placebo-controlled trials of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia: review of the literature and discussion of feasibility and potential value [^113uHaYZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a broad range of clinical manifestations, from apparently self-limited illness to severe disease. This observation raises the question of whether to perform placebo-controlled trials involving patients with mild CAP to determine quantitatively the treatment effect of antibiotic therapy for CAP. A critical analysis of the literature reveals that most clinical trials underestimate the proportion of CAP cases of all severities that are caused by typical bacteria, particularly pneumococci. Studies that use vigorous diagnostic methods consistently report that the majority of CAP cases are caused by pneumococci. Currently, there is little evidence that viruses cause a substantial proportion of CAP cases in adults. Although relevant placebo-controlled trials have not been published in recent years, other evidence indicates that antibiotic therapy is unequivocally effective for pneumococcal pneumonia. The availability of effective therapy for Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia presents clinical, ethical, and pragmatic obstacles to the performance of placebo-controlled trials. Furthermore, if placebo-controlled trials were performed for mild CAP, patients with risk factors for pneumococcal pneumonia and patients with predictors of systemic illness would be excluded, thereby resulting in a highly selected population. On the basis of the data reviewed, there is no justification for placebo-controlled trials involving patients with CAP of any degree of severity.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### What is the role of newer molecular tests in the management of CAP? [^111JegPL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) accounts for major morbidity and mortality in the United States. With improved broad-spectrum antibiotics, the implementation of diagnostic studies has declined and most patients do not have an etiologic pathogen of CAP identified. To enhance the appropriate use of antiviral agents and prevent overuse of antibiotics, the successful management of CAP requires rapid and accurate diagnosis of the etiologic agent of CAP. This article provides an overview of the new rapid molecular tests for the diagnosis of influenza, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria compared with nonmolecular tests and how their use for directed therapy can enhance and improve the management of CAP.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: timely management measures in the first 24 hours [^116MYtde]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has plagued humankind for millennia. Hippocrates described pneumonia as a disease which the "ancients" named, and stated that "when pneumonia is at its height, the case is beyond remedy if he is not purged". Prognosis remained bleak through the centuries. Osler, widely recognised as the father of modern medicine, called pneumonia the "captain of the men of death" in 1901. Although outcomes improved with the advent of antibiotics, CAP continues to be one of the world's leading causes of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality. Studies have shown that between 2 and 24% of patients presenting to hospitals with CAP require admission to an ICU. Hospital mortality rates for these patients range from 17 to 49% in large multicentre cohort studies, and there are conflicting data on whether these rates are increasing or decreasing over time.

Calls have been made to treat CAP as an emergency, with aggressive interventions to lower mortality. Unfortunately, while national and international clinical practice guidelines for CAP typically review severity assessment, diagnostic tools, and choice of antibiotics, they do not emphasise the importance of timely resuscitation and care of respiratory failure. In this review, we will explore how early and aggressive management measures may result in decreased mortality in severe CAP. We focus on the impact of management measures implemented within the first 24 hours and carried out both in the emergency department (ED) and in the ICU. These measures comprise those which specifically target severe CAP, such as identification and antibiotics, as well as those which target its complications, including septic shock and respiratory failure.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with community-acquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

Influenza testing in adults with CAP — when influenza is circulating, molecular testing is preferred, with selective testing during low activity. "When influenza viruses are circulating in the community, we recommend testing for influenza with a rapid influenza molecular assay (i.e., influenza nucleic acid amplification test), which is preferred over a rapid influenza diagnostic test (i.e., antigen test) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". The guideline adds, "During periods of low influenza activity, testing can be considered but may not be routinely performed". Supporting context notes, "Rapid influenza tests have become increasingly available, moving from earlier antigen-based detection tests to nucleic acid amplification tests".

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^117PyR3C]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The study Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia was published by Ane Uranga and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the trial question was: what is the role of duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia? In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the population was: 312 patients (116 female, 196 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were HIV infection; chronic immunosuppression; lived in a nursing home; discharge from an acute care hospital, an onsite subacute care unit, or a palliative care unit within the previous 14 days; taken antibiotics in the 30 days before admission. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the interventions were: n = 162 discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days (protocolized duration of antibiotic treatment for a minimum of 5 days) n = 150 physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation (duration of antibiotic treatment determined by physicians). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in clinical success at day 10 (56.3% vs. 48.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI -0.53 to 2.85). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical success at day 30 (91.9% vs. 88.6%; RR 1.04, 95% CI -1.03 to 3.11) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 5 (27.2 vs. 24.7; AD 2.5, 95% CI -0.48 to 5.48) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 10 (17.9 points vs. 18.6 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -3.99 to 2.59). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days were noninferior to physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation with respect to clinical success at day 10.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### What can we learn from the time course of untreated and partially treated community-onset Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia? A clinical perspective on superiority and noninferiority trial designs for mild community-acquired pneumonia [^1135MKnh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are no well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials in the recent era that precisely define the magnitude of the drug effect of antimicrobial therapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, there is evidence that ineffective therapies, selected on the basis of the ratio of 24-h area under the concentration curve to minimum inhibitory concentration, associated with a discordant (nonsusceptible in vitro) specific agent (or no therapy) for mild CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased risk of progression to serious CAP. The relatively high rate of clinical success associated with appropriate antimicrobial treatment of mild CAP renders a standard outcome measure of clinical success an unlikely way to differentiate new agents. However, there may be an advantage in composite outcome assessments for mild CAP. Composite-outcomes end points that include time to resolution of morbidity, the use of patient reported-outcomes instruments, and biomarkers are recommended for future studies. Because the composite rate of success in recent randomized clinical trials exceeds 90%, it would seem that a noninferiority margin of 10% is reasonable for trials for mild CAP.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Community-acquired pneumonia: process of care studies [^116FyvWi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

New insight has been gained into the relationship between the processes of care undertaken for patients with community-acquired pneumonia and the resulting outcomes. Better insight into the risks for a complicated course can increase the percentage of patients treated as outpatients. Studies have also suggested that both the promptness and the choice of antibiotic therapy can affect patient outcomes. Promptly switching to oral antibiotic therapy can often lead to a shorter length of hospital stay; however, concern has arisen regarding the effect of shorter lengths of stay on patient outcomes.

### Childhood community-acquired pneumonia: a review of etiology-and antimicrobial treatment studies [^115CpSnP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.

### Chlamydia pneumoniae infection surveillance and trends… [^1166ytmg]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- There is no national reporting or surveillance system for Chlamydia pneumoniaeinfections.
- The true number of people affected by C. pneumoniaeinfections each year is unknown.
- Many C. pneumoniaeinfections aren't identified due to mild illness or lack of symptoms and infrequent laboratory testing. Data sources C. pneumoniae infection isn't a nationally notifiable condition. There are no surveillance systems to collect information about cases. However, studies and outbreak investigations provide helpful information. Studies Most estimates of the impact of C. pneumoniae come from studies looking at the causes of community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is a term for when someone develops pneumonia in the community. C. pneumoniae often cause mild illness so many people don't seek care for it. In fact, some people who are infected don't have any symptoms.

Thus, studies based on people with community-acquired pneumonia likely underestimate true cases of C. pneumoniae infection. A large-scale U. S. study of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization found C. pneumoniae was a rare cause of infection in children and adults. Outbreaks Outbreaks occur mostly in crowded environments including:

- College residence halls
- Detention or correctional facilities
- Hospitals
- Long-term care settings
- Military training facilities
- Schools Outbreaks may last a long time for several reasons. First, people without symptoms can spread the bacteria. This includes during the 3- to 4-week-long incubation period. Second, since. C. pneumoniae infections are generally mild, people usually don't need treatment but can be contagious for several weeks after symptoms start. Outbreaks of C.

pneumoniae infection are primarily controlled by common infection control and prevention measures, including handwashing.

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^1173MLCC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the US, CAP results in about 1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 108 deaths each year. Mortality after hospitalization for CAP is 2. 8% for adults younger than 60 years and
26. 8% for those aged 60 years or older who have multiple medical conditions.
1. Risk factors for CAP include older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes, and heavy alcohol use. CAP can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although the pathogen is often not identified. Among hospitalized patients with CAP, the most common causes are viruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging. Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered.

All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community. Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria. For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation. Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock.

People with a prior episode of CAP are at increased risk of CAP and should be advised about smoking and alcohol cessation and relevant vaccinations. Vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus can help prevent or decrease the severity of CAP, especially in older adults or those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma, COPD, HIV, or cancer.

### Treatment challenges… [^1119QypK]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1 About one third of these adults require hospitalization. 1 The mortality rate among hospitalized patients with CAP varies each year and can reach 35 percent. 2 While Streptococcus pneumoniae causes up to 70 percent of CAP cases, atypical pathogens are responsible for 30 to 40 percent of cases 3 and may be copathogens in other cases. M. pneumoniae infection occurs throughout the year but can cause periodic outbreaks within small communities. Transmission is by person-to-person contact, and infection spreads slowly, most often within closed populations. M. pneumoniae is the pathogen most often associated with atypical pneumonia. Onset is insidious, over several days to a week. Constitutional symptoms, which usually are present, include headache exacerbated by a cough, malaise, myalgias, and sore throat. The cough is usually dry, paroxysmal, and worse at night.

CHLAMYDIA PNEUMONIAE Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular organism capable of persistent latent infection. Humans are the only known reservoir. Transmission results from contact with respiratory secretions, with an incubation period of several weeks. By the age of 20 years, one half of persons in the United States have detectable levels of antibody to. C. pneumoniae. 7 The antibody is present in 75 percent of elderly persons. 7 C. pneumoniae infection is more likely to occur in older patients with comorbid diseases than in those who are otherwise healthy. 8 Patients with. Most cases of C. pneumoniae infection are mild, but severe disease can occur, necessitating admission to an intensive care unit.
