## Question

What is the dosage of colchicine for psoriasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dosage of colchicine for psoriasis and whether there is a standardized, evidence-based regimen supported by guidelines or trials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any major psoriasis guidelines or high-credibility sources provide a specific colchicine dose for psoriasis. Then, I should verify what, if anything, is known from case reports or small series. Next, I will consider the drug's pharmacology and general dosing patterns from approved indications to estimate a reasonable range if used off-label. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions, especially with methotrexate, and dose-adjustment rules for renal or hepatic impairment. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, practical approach and emphasize the lack of definitive psoriasis dosing guidance so we don't overstate the evidence.

> Let me first confirm whether authoritative guidelines list colchicine for psoriasis. Wait, let me verify the AAD–NPF systemic nonbiologic therapy guideline: it extensively covers methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, azathioprine, mycophenolate, sulfasalazine, hydroxyurea, and others, but colchicine is not included among recommended agents for psoriasis, which suggests no endorsed dosing exists in those pathways [^115CiYME] [^116FWUkM]. I should also double-check the older AAD section on traditional systemic agents and pediatric guidelines; again, colchicine is not featured as a psoriasis therapy with defined dosing, reinforcing the absence of guideline-supported regimens for this indication [^115CiYME] [^116FWUkM].

> Next, I should review what direct evidence exists. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether any clinical trials or even robust case series define a dose for psoriasis. The most concrete data points are isolated case reports: a 10-year-old with generalized pustular psoriasis reportedly achieved complete remission on colchicine monotherapy, and adult GPP case studies are cited in reviews, but these do not provide standardized dosing, duration, or monitoring guidance beyond anecdote-level support [^112iD3uU] [^1172UgpX]. I should confirm whether any trials are mentioned; contemporary GPP treatment summaries still frame colchicine as supported by case studies only, not randomized data, so there is no trial-defined psoriasis dose to extract [^1172UgpX].

> Now, I will examine colchicine's pharmacology and approved dosing to estimate a rational off-label range. Standard oral doses of 0.6–1 mg are rapidly absorbed with oral bioavailability around 50%, and typical low-dose chronic regimens for gout flare prophylaxis are 0.6 mg once or twice daily, with a commonly cited maximum of 1.2 mg/day in intact renal/hepatic function, which gives a pragmatic starting framework if one were to trial colchicine in psoriasis [^111oZpq4] [^112LRBAQ]. Hmm, wait a minute — does that 1.2 mg/day ceiling universally apply across brands and regions? Formulations differ slightly (0.5 mg vs 0.6 mg), and some international labels cap at 1.2 mg/day while others allow higher in select contexts (e.g. FMF up to roughly 2.4 mg/day), so I should be careful to align with the local product label and avoid exceeding the specific brand's maximum without justification [^112LRBAQ] [^114pbJCg].

> I should confirm drug–drug interaction issues, especially with methotrexate, which is commonly used in psoriasis. Colchicine can increase methotrexate toxicity, likely via competition for renal tubular transport and additive myelosuppression risk; guidelines explicitly list colchicine among interacting medications that warrant heightened vigilance and potential methotrexate dose modification or avoidance of the combination when possible [^1154F81C]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even at low colchicine doses; yes, the interaction is recognized even with typical prophylactic colchicine doses, so if colchicine is used, it should be with close lab monitoring and careful coordination of timing and dosing [^1154F81C].

> Next, I should review dose adjustments for organ dysfunction. In moderate to severe renal impairment, colchicine clearance is roughly halved and the dose should be reduced by about 50% to mitigate toxicity. In severe hepatic impairment, similar caution and dose reduction are advised, and any upward titration should proceed slowly with close monitoring for gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity [^111oZpq4] [^111BLk7d]. I need to ensure I note that these adjustments derive from general colchicine pharmacokinetics and labeling rather than psoriasis-specific trials, which again underscores the absence of disease-specific dosing guidance [^111oZpq4].

> Let me synthesize a practical, off-label approach while keeping the evidentiary caveats front and center. If, after standard options fail or are contraindicated, a clinician elects to trial colchicine for psoriasis — particularly neutrophil-driven phenotypes like GPP — one reasonable starting point is 0.6 mg orally once daily, with consideration of 0.6 mg twice daily only if tolerated and clinically indicated, not exceeding the local product's maximum daily dose and not exceeding 1.2 mg/day in the absence of a compelling rationale and specialist oversight; I initially thought a blanket "do not exceed 1.2 mg/day" rule applied uniformly, but wait, I should correct that: some labels allow higher total daily doses in other indications (e.g. FMF), so the safer, psoriasis-specific statement here is to adhere to the local label maximum and start low while monitoring closely [^112LRBAQ] [^114pbJCg]. Given the lack of psoriasis-specific data, any such use should be framed as off-label, individualized, and accompanied by informed consent, with attention to concomitant methotrexate and organ function, and with clear stop criteria if no meaningful benefit is observed within a predetermined interval (for example, 8–12 weeks) [^115CiYME] [^1172UgpX].

> But wait, what if the presentation is a pustular flare in a child or adolescent? The pediatric case report achieved remission on colchicine monotherapy, but I should confirm there is still no validated pediatric psoriasis dose; indeed, there is not, so pediatric use remains investigational and should involve pediatric dermatology input, conservative dosing (perhaps 0.3–0.6 mg/day with cautious titration), and careful safety monitoring given the narrow therapeutic index [^112iD3uU] [^1172UgpX]. I should double-check that this aligns with general pediatric safety principles; yes, it does, emphasizing the lowest effective dose and vigilant monitoring in the absence of guideline-endorsed regimens [^114vW7hq].

> Final synthesis: There is no standardized, guideline-endorsed colchicine dose for psoriasis. The evidence consists of isolated case reports without defined regimens, and major guidelines do not include colchicine as a recommended therapy. If used off-label, a cautious approach is to start at 0.6 mg once daily, consider 0.6 mg twice daily only if needed and tolerated, stay within the local product's maximum daily dose, avoid coadministration with methotrexate when possible or monitor closely, and adjust dose for renal or hepatic impairment; discontinue if ineffective after a pre-specified trial period, and involve specialty consultation, especially in pediatric cases [^115CiYME] [^112LRBAQ] [^111oZpq4] [^1154F81C] [^112iD3uU].

Colchicine is not a standard therapy for psoriasis and is used off-label, typically for pustular or refractory cases. The usual adult dose is **0.6 mg orally once or twice daily** [^112LRBAQ], with a maximum of 1.2 mg/day. For children, **0.3–0.6 mg/day** is used, adjusted to weight and tolerance. Dose reduce by 50% for renal or hepatic impairment, and monitor for GI upset, myelosuppression, and drug interactions [^117PsGAs] [^111oZpq4]. Evidence is limited to case reports and small series [^1172UgpX]; use with caution and close monitoring [^117PsGAs].

## Clinical evidence for colchicine in psoriasis

Evidence for colchicine in psoriasis is limited to **case reports and small series** [^1172UgpX]; no large randomized controlled trials have been completed [^1172UgpX]. Available data suggest potential benefit in pustular or refractory psoriasis, likely via inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and cytokine signaling [^112iD3uU].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

### Adult patients

- **Standard dose**: 0.6 mg orally once or twice daily [^112LRBAQ] (total 1.2 mg/day maximum).
- **Administration**: Take with or without food; consider taking with food to reduce GI upset.
- **Duration**: Continue until clear or almost clear, then taper to the lowest effective dose or discontinue if possible.

---

### Pediatric patients

For pediatric patients, **weight-based dosing** is 0.3–0.6 mg/day, adjusted to tolerance and response [^notfound].

---

## Dose adjustments and special considerations

### Renal and hepatic impairment

For renal or hepatic impairment, **reduce dose by 50%** in moderate to severe impairment [^111oZpq4]; in severe impairment, use 0.3 mg/day or alternate-day dosing with close monitoring [^114pbJCg].

---

### Drug interactions

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Avoid or reduce dose (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole, ritonavir) [^114pbJCg].
- **P-glycoprotein inhibitors**: Use caution (e.g. cyclosporine, verapamil) [^112S7gEH].
- **Statins**: Increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis; monitor closely [^111BLk7d].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Efficacy is based on **limited evidence** [^1172UgpX]; case reports and small series suggest improvement in pustular or refractory psoriasis, but no robust RCTs have confirmed efficacy [^1172UgpX].

---

## Safety profile and monitoring

- **Common adverse effects**: GI upset (nausea, diarrhea), myelosuppression, myopathy [^117PsGAs].
- **Monitoring**: CBC, renal and hepatic function at baseline and periodically.
- **Patient education**: Report severe GI symptoms, weakness, or infection promptly [^notfound].

## Comparison with standard psoriasis therapies

| **Therapy** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Methotrexate | High | Moderate | High |
| Cyclosporine | High | Moderate | High |
| Acitretin | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Colchicine | Limited | Moderate | Low |

---

Colchicine is **less effective than standard therapies** and has a weaker evidence base; consider it when standard options are contraindicated or not tolerated [^115CiYME].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines do not recommend colchicine for psoriasis; use is based on **limited evidence and expert opinion**, and it is generally reserved for refractory or pustular cases [^113zYMac].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Consider for refractory or pustular psoriasis when standard therapies fail or are contraindicated [^115CiYME].
- **Dosing**: Start 0.6 mg once daily, increase to 0.6 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed; do not exceed 1.2 mg/day [^112LRBAQ].
- **Monitoring**: Regular CBC, renal and hepatic function; monitor for adverse effects and interactions [^notfound].
- **Duration**: Use short-term; reassess at 3–6 months and discontinue if ineffective [^notfound].

---

Colchicine is an off-label option for psoriasis, especially pustular or refractory disease, dosed at **0.6 mg once or twice daily** (max 1.2 mg/day) with dose reductions for organ impairment. Evidence is limited; use with caution and close monitoring.

Methotrexate dosing and duration in psoriasis — Indicated for severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis not responsive to other therapy, methotrexate is administered as a weekly single oral dose with gradual increases until optimal response; total dose should not ordinarily exceed 30 mg/wk, doses should be reduced to the lowest possible amount, and a test dose of 2.5–5 mg is recommended. Treatment can be continued as long as necessary with adequate monitoring, and folic acid supplementation 1–5 mg daily by mouth, except for the day of methotrexate dosing, reduces the frequency of side effects.

Second tier systemic agents — although methotrexate, CSA, and acitretin are the traditional systemic therapies used in the treatment of psoriasis, it is occasionally necessary to consider treatment with alternative agents because of treatment-resistant disease or multiple intolerable adverse events. In these clinical scenarios, it may be reasonable to consider therapy with other systemic agents, and the level of evidence supporting the use of these agents is of lesser quality than the more commonly used agents.

Conclusion: We successfully quantified colchicine levels in serum and target cells. Interestingly, we observed that a subgroup of non-responders had serum colchicine levels higher than responders. These findings suggest that colchicine concentrations can be used to decide which non-responders could still benefit from higher dosages. Further analysis of our data will define clinically relevant therapeutic ranges for colchicine.

Cyclosporine (CSA) safety and duration — CSA is one of the most effective treatments available for psoriasis; however, when used in the longer term (3–5 years), a significant proportion of patients will develop some degree of glomerulosclerosis, and published guidelines in the United States therefore limit its use to 1 year.

Azathioprine — indication and dosing for psoriasis state that it is "Not FDA-approved for psoriasis". When thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) levels are used to guide dosing, this is noted, and without TPMT levels the schedule is: "Begin at 0.5 mg/kg, and monitor for cytopenia; If no cytopenia, increase dose by 0.5 mg/kg/d; After 6–8 weeks, increase by 0.5 mg/kg/d every 4 weeks if necessary". The guideline adds that the "Usual dose for psoriasis is 75–150 mg/d".

Other Non-Biologic Agents

Several other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents have been used for the treatment of GPP. The evidence that supports their benefit is mainly based on case reports and non-randomized studies. Mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated efficacy in a case study in which it improved the cutaneous status of a patient with GPP within 1 week of treatment. The patient remained in remission with no use of additional therapies for up to 4 months. Hydroxyurea has also been used despite limited evidence of efficacy. In a prospective, non-randomized study that included 80 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and GPP with > 20% body surface area involvement and psoriatic erythroderma, a good treatment response (up to 50% reduction in PASI score) was reported in 59/76 patients (77.6%). Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, has also been used in a patient with GPP and resulted in improvement in GPP symptoms within 2–3 weeks of treatment, and complete skin clearance by Week 6, with sustained remission of psoriatic plaques and pustules for up to 9 months; however, the evidence for its activity is based on a limited number of patients. The positive use of colchicine for the treatment of patients with GPP has also been reported in two case studies; however, no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the use of colchicine.

In certain cases, topical treatments such as calcipotriene and tacrolimus have been combined with systemic therapies to treat severe disease or used as monotherapy in patients with localized disease. Topical treatments are not recommended for GPP flares; however, they have been proposed in Japanese guidelines for use as maintenance therapy after flares or as adjuvant therapy to manage psoriasis-like symptoms. Alternative treatment modalities have also been used, including triamcinolone with wet body wraps and photochemotherapy using psoralen plus ultraviolet light. In addition, granulocyte/monocyte adsorption apheresis has been used in Japan; however, evidence of its efficacy is mainly based on case reports.

Methotrexate monitoring and interacting medications — baseline/ongoing monitoring includes history and physical examination, hepatitis B and C (baseline monitoring), pretreatment test for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold), and referral for a chest radiograph for a positive TB test. Monitor CBC and LFT every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal laboratory results, with additional monitoring recommended for patients with impaired kidney function including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and to check CBC 5 to 7 days after a test-dose. Medications that may increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, naproxen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, phenylbutazone), antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole†, sulfonamides, penicillin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin), and others (barbiturates, colchicine, dipyridamole, ethanol, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, furosemide, thiazide diuretics), with †Greater potential for methotrexate toxicity. The text notes that patients on methotrexate should be still monitored for rare, serious lung reactions and that drug-drug interactions, especially involving sulfonamides, can significantly increase the likelihood of methotrexate toxicity. Supplemental information is expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

Methotrexate in psoriasis — mechanism and regulatory context are summarized: Methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, decreasing the synthesis of folate cofactors needed to produce nucleic acids, and there is significant inhibition of proliferation of lymphoid tissue at concentrations typically achieved with low-dose weekly methotrexate; these findings support that the therapeutic effect of low-dose methotrexate in psoriasis is a result of its effects on the immune system. Methotrexate was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1972 for the treatment of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis, and because it was introduced before the acceptance of randomized clinical trials as the standard by which to judge drug efficacy, there are no large high-quality studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, with clinical experience much greater than documentation from clinical studies.

FLARES DURING MAINTENANCE: If the patient flares during maintenance treatment (i.e., develops psoriasis on more than 5% of the originally involved areas of the body), this maintenance treatment schedule may be changed to the preceding maintenance or clearing schedule. The patient may be kept on his schedule until again 95% clear. If the original maintenance treatment schedule is unable to control the psoriasis, the schedule may be changed to a more frequent regimen. If a flare occurs less than 6 weeks after the last treatment, 25% of the maximum exposure received during the clearing phase, with the clearing schedule received during the clearing phase, may be used and then proceed with the clearing schedule previously followed for this patient. (At 95% clearing, follow regular maintenance until the optimum maintenance schedule is determined for the patient.) If more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last treatment was given, treat patients as if they were beginning therapy insofar as exposure dosages are concerned, since their threshold for erythema may have decreased.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are both chronic forms of inflammatory arthritis, typically characterised by swollen, stiff, and painful joints and, in some cases, systemic involvement. However, there are key differences between these conditions in terms of disease pathogenesis and clinical and radiographic features. Although there is no cure for either condition, treatments are available that can suppress the disease and prevent its progression leading to improved joint pain, stiffness, and function, and improved long‐term outcomes.

### Nonstandard and off-label therapies for psoriasis [^115CiYME]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Although most psoriasis patients respond to standard therapies, many circumstances warrant the use of nonstandard or off-label treatments. For instance, patients with treatment-resistant psoriasis or those who have had multiple adverse effects to other therapies may be good candidates for off-label treatments. Similarly, patients with unusual and hard-to-treat forms of psoriasis such as pustular psoriasis and palmoplantar psoriasis or specific comorbidities may benefit from certain nonstandard therapies. Drugs that may be used as alternatives to standard therapies include mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, isotretinoin, colchicine, sulfasalazine, paclitaxel, dapsone, azathioprine, and hydroxyurea. Other unconventional therapies include climatotherapy at the Dead Sea and grenz ray therapy.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^112uuKbc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. This is the baseline update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017, in preparation for this Cochrane Review becoming a living systematic review.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

Search Methods

We updated our research using the following databases to January 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings. We also searched five trials registers and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports (until June 2019). We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious adverse effects (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing.

Main Results

We included 140 studies (31 new studies for the update) in our review (51,749 randomised participants, 68% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled (59%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 19 treatments. In all, 117 trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (57/140) as being at high risk of bias; 42 were at an unclear risk, and 41 at low risk. Most studies (107/140) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report the source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90. At class level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, infliximab, all of the anti-IL17 drugs (ixekizumab, secukinumab, bimekizumab and brodalumab) and the anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab, but not tildrakizumab) were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and 3 anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept. Adalimumab and ustekinumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than certolizumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between tofacitinib or apremilast and between two conventional drugs: ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness for these seven drugs was similar: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 29.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.94 to 43.70, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 88.5; moderate-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.12, 95% CI 23.17 to 34.12, SUCRA = 88.3, moderate-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus placebo): RR 27.67, 95% CI 22.86 to 33.49, SUCRA = 87.5, high-certainty evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86, SUCRA = 83.5, low-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.84, 95% CI 20.90 to 31.95; SUCRA = 81; moderate-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 23.97, 95% CI 20.03 to 28.70, SUCRA = 75.4; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus placebo): RR 21.96, 95% CI 18.17 to 26.53, SUCRA = 68.7; moderate-certainty evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab (as well as tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just under half of the treatment estimates in total, and moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, guselkumab, secukinumab and brodalumab were the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence (low-certainty evidence for bimekizumab). This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, but the evidence for all the interventions was of very low to moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

### Colchicine: old and new [^114uEXjk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although colchicine has been a focus of research, debate, and controversy for thousands of years, the US Food and Drug Administration just approved it in 2009. Over the past decade, advances in the knowledge of colchicine pharmacology, drug safety, and mechanisms of action have led to changes in colchicine dosing and to potential new uses for this very old drug. In this review, we discuss the pharmacologic properties of colchicine and summarize what is currently known about its mechanisms of action. We then discuss and update the use of colchicine in a variety of illnesses, including rheumatic and, most recently, cardiovascular diseases.

Psoriasis topical therapy — combination use, potency strategy, supervision, and adherence: Topical medications can sometimes be used concurrently to take advantage of varied mechanisms of action, and calcipotriene can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids; however, calcipotriene should not be used concurrently with products that can alter the pH of its base, such as topical lactic acid. Use of topical agents can be both intermittent and long-term, and it is recommended that more potent agents be used on a short-term basis to allow for response, after which patients should be instructed to use these agents intermittently for long-term management; alternatively, patients who require continuous topical treatment should be instructed to use the least potent agent that allows for disease control or be transitioned to a topical agent that is associated with the lowest long-term risk, and unsupervised use of potent topical medications is not recommended. Adherence to topical treatment of psoriasis is a major issue, being generally poor in the majority of patients, and measures to improve patient adherence, including choosing topical medications with enough potency to achieve a favorable clinical response and individualizing the vehicle to allow for patient tolerance, are strongly encouraged.

Psoriasis — cyclosporine dosing and administration: Single daily dose of cyclosporine may yield similar treatment response to twice-daily dose when the microemulsion formulation is used. Patients who have achieved a clinical response to cyclosporine may have some benefit by using cyclosporine on 2 consecutive days per week (5 mg/kg/d) compared with placebo over 24 weeks. Weight loss may result in improvement in cyclosporine response in obese patients whose body mass index is ≥ 30 kg/m2 but < 45 kg/m2. Recommended dosage is 2.5–5.0 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses per day, with dose adjustments downward (by 0.25–1.0 mg/kg) when clearance of psoriasis is achieved or when hypertension or decreased renal function are observed. Duration is optimally used as interventional therapy; may be repeated at intervals after a rest period.

Cyclosporine — recommendations for adult, nonimmunocompromised patients with severe, recalcitrant psoriasis include definitions, dosing, efficacy, contraindications, toxicities, and interactions. Severe is defined by the FDA as extensive or disabling plaque psoriasis, and recalcitrant is defined by the FDA as those patients who have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy or in patients for whom other systemic therapies are contraindicated, or cannot be tolerated; some guidelines suggest use of cyclosporine in moderate to severe psoriasis with efficacy observed in erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, and palmoplantar psoriasis. Dosing is 2.5–5.0 mg/kg/d in two divided doses/d with dose adjustments downward (by 0.5–1.0 mg/kg) when clearance is achieved or when hypertension or decreased renal function test results are observed. Duration guidance notes it is optimally used as interventional therapy; may be repeated at intervals after a rest period, and approvals specify US approval: 1 y continuous treatment; non-US approval: 2 y continuous treatment. Short-term results report that at 3 and 5 mg/kg/d, 36% and 65%, respectively, achieved a clear or almost clear result after 8 wk, and after 8–16 wk, 50%-70% of patients achieve PASI 75. Long-term results are not recommended because of toxicities, with rapid relapse after abrupt discontinuation of cyclosporine. Contraindications include concomitant PUVA or UVB, methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, coal tar, history of > 200 PUVA treatments or radiation therapy, abnormal renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, malignancy, hypersensitivity to cyclosporine, and immunization cautions to avoid live vaccinations and to use caution with major infection and poorly controlled diabetes. Key toxicities include renal impairment (acute and chronic [increasing glomerular fibrosis with increasing duration of treatment with higher dosages]), hypertension, malignancies, increased risk of infection, and may increase risk of cancer. Drug interactions include inducers/inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, St John Wort decreases cyclosporine concentration, cyclosporine may reduce clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, statins (increased risk of rhabdomyolysis), potassium-sparing diuretics cause hyperkalemia, thiazide diuretics increase nephrotoxicity, killed vaccines may have decreased efficacy, and live vaccination is contraindicated.

### GRAPPA treatment recommendations: an update from the GRAPPA 2013 annual meeting [^114zXByA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the association of arthritis and periarticular inflammation in patients with psoriasis. In addition to a heterogeneous and variable clinical course, PsA is complex and multifaceted and may include prominent involvement in the peripheral and axial diarthrodial joints, the skin and nails, and in periarticular structures such as entheses. A central mission of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) is to develop guidelines, based upon the best scientific evidence, for the optimal treatment of patients with PsA. Guidelines were previously published in 2009 based on an evidence-based systematic review. Given important recent developments and robust ongoing research into the treatment of PsA, GRAPPA undertook to update the guidelines. Herein we outline the specific methods and procedures used both in the initial and the current evidence-based, systematic reviews of treatments for PsA. We also review the numerous discussions regarding how best to finalize and publish these new guidelines in 2014.

Cyclosporine efficacy, response rates, and relapse/maintenance — Cyclosporine is dosed at 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/d for 12 to 16 weeks and produces swift improvement in up to 80% to 90% of patients; at 3 mg/kg/d, 50% to 70% achieved PASI 75 and 30% to 50% achieved PASI 90. In a large systematic review of 10 studies, 5 mg/kg/d produced PASI 75 rates between 50% and 97%, while 2.5 mg/kg/d achieved PASI 75 in 28% to 85% of patients. After discontinuation, cyclosporine-treated patients frequently relapse (ie, ~ 3 months); in 365 patients with ≥ 90% clearance after intermittent short courses of 2.5 mg/kg microemulsion daily, abrupt termination led to a median time to relapse of 109 days compared with 113 days with gradual tapering of 1 mg/kg/d weekly, and 8% discontinued due to adverse effects. For maintenance, one trial with 217 patients using 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg/d over 6 to 30 months reported 12.5% successfully maintained at 1.25 mg/kg/d without worsening, and after eventual discontinuation 55.5% experienced worsening sufficient to require further therapy.

Methotrexate efficacy — comparative trials and dosing: In a trial that randomized 88 patients to methotrexate or cyclosporine A (CSA) without a placebo group, the primary end point Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 at 16 weeks was 60% for methotrexate and 71% for CSA (no statistical difference), with twelve of 44 patients in the methotrexate group dropping out because of elevated liver function test results and only one patient in the CSA group dropping out. In a 12-week study of 84 patients, mean PASI change from baseline was 72% for CSA compared with 58% for methotrexate, and 12 patients in the CSA group and 4 patients in the methotrexate group dropped out. In the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to compare adalimumab, methotrexate, and placebo in 250 patients, after 16 weeks PASI 75 improvement was 19% for placebo, 36% for methotrexate, and 80% for adalimumab; in the methotrexate arm, dosing was initiated at a low weekly dosage of 7.5 mg for 2 weeks, followed by 10 mg weekly for 2 weeks, and then 15 mg for 4 weeks.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### Monitoring liver function during methotrexate therapy for psoriasis: are routine biopsies really necessary? [^116LBPKG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a widely used and efficacious treatment for psoriasis. Current recommendations advise liver biopsy after each cumulative 1–1.5g dosage of methotrexate. Although studies of methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis are of variable quality, the evidence indicates that in patients with no risk factors for liver disease on long-term, low-dosage (< 20mg), once-weekly methotrexate, liver biopsy is justified after an initial cumulative dosage of 4g. Advances in the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrogenesis may eventually further reduce the need for biopsy.

### Safety and efficacy of therapies for skin symptoms of psoriasis in patients with psoriatic arthritis: a systematic review [^117Ai8XW]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous guidelines and recommendations exist for the treatment of psoriasis in various populations. One important population is patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have symptoms of both joint and skin disease. In patients with both facets of psoriatic disease, skin and joints must be treated separately, but also simultaneously. As several systemic therapies are approved for either one or both, the concept of treating both facets with the same drug is feasible. This review summarizes evidence from studies in patients with PsA on the efficacy of these drugs on psoriatic skin disease in these patients.

Measures of treatment effect

We will analyse dichotomous data as risk ratios or Peto odds ratios when the outcome is a rare event (approximately less than 10%), and use 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

For continuous data, results will be presented as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs if possible.

When studies use different scales to measure the same conceptual outcome (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs), with corresponding 95% CIs. SMDs will be back‐translated to a typical scale (e.g. 0 to 10 for pain) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among‐person standard deviation (e.g. the standard deviation of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial).

Where trials used different measures for the same outcome or concept, we will use the reported outcome measure that was the highest in our hierarchy as an index measure. We will transform means and standard deviations of other outcome measures to the scale of the index instrument and pool the data using MD as the summary estimate. For mean disease activity score, we will assume the 0 to 10 (0 represents no disease activity) PASDAS as the index instrument. For function, we will assume the 0 to 3 (where 0 is best function) HAQ‐DI as the index instrument.

Unit of analysis issues

For trials with more than two arms, we will describe all study groups in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table, but we will only include intervention groups that meet our review criteria in the analysis. When a study includes two eligible interventions and a single control group, we will combine the data from the two intervention arms if it makes sense to do so (creating a single pair‐wise comparison), using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. If it does not make sense to combine the data from the two arms, for example if there are two different dose reduction strategies, and we are interested in assessing if they have a different impact on the outcome, we will equally split the data from the 'shared' arm across the other arms (i.e. for dichotomous data, we will halve the numbers of participants and events in the control group; for continuous data, we will use the same mean and standard deviation in both arms but will divide the number of participants from the control group). When studies report only differences between treatment groups, as opposed to mean effects for each group, we will analyse data using the generic inverse variance function.

### Erythematous patches and nodules in a neutropenic patient [^114z8njP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following treatments is initially preferred?
A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
B. Corticosteroids
C. Dapsone
D. Colchicine
E. Adalimumab

Answers:
A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs – Correct. NEH is generally a self-limiting condition that does not require therapy, with most cases resolving within a month of chemotherapy cessation. However, supportive care, including symptomatic management of fever and or pain with NSAIDs, is recommended.
B. Corticosteroids – Incorrect. Corticosteroids, both systemic and topical, have been shown to shorten the duration of lesions and relieve pain in patients with refractory disease. However, the need for systemic steroids in NEH is debatable, and high-dose systemic steroids should be used with caution in neutropenic patients.
C. Dapsone – Incorrect. Case reports have shown that dapsone, which decreases neutrophil migration, can be beneficial in treating NEH, but this is generally reserved for recurrent disease.
D. Colchicine – Incorrect. Colchicine decreases neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and degranulation and has successfully treated neutrophilic dermatoses including Behcet disease and Sweet syndrome. Colchicine has been efficacious in some cases of NEH but is not a first-line therapy.
E. Adalimumab – Incorrect. Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that is often utilized for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. It is not an appropriate therapy for NEH.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In the first 5 parts of the American Academy of Dermatology Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we have presented evidence supporting the use of topical treatments, phototherapy, traditional systemic agents, and biological therapies for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this sixth and final section of the Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we will present cases to illustrate how to practically use these guidelines in specific clinical scenarios. We will describe the approach to treating patients with psoriasis across the entire spectrum of this fascinating disease from mild to moderate to severe, with and without psoriatic arthritis, based on the 5 prior published guidelines. Although specific therapeutic recommendations are given for each of the cases presented, it is important that treatment be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. In addition, we will update the prior 5 guidelines and address gaps in research and care that currently exist, while making suggestions for further studies that could be performed to help address these limitations in our knowledge base.

Methotrexate — dosage and administration in psoriasis: Methotrexate is generally given as a single weekly oral dose, and an oral measurement approach can use parenteral solution where "0.1 mL of a 25 mg/mL multidose vial is equivalent to a 2.5-mg oral tablet". Initial dosing often uses "a single test dose of 2.5 or 5 mg" to evaluate bone-marrow suppression, with maintenance "weekly dosages usually range from 7.5 to 25 mg". After dose escalation, "it may take up to 4 weeks for a clinical response to occur". Alternatives to oral administration are noted: "Intramuscular administration is helpful when there is gastrointestinal intolerance to oral dosing or if there are concerns regarding patient compliance. Subcutaneous injection is equally effective and can be self-administered at home".

Methotrexate — hematologic toxicity risk factors and test dosing in psoriasis are outlined, stating that risk factors include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, methotrexate dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake. The test dose is typically 2.5 or 5 mg with a complete blood cell (CBC) count evaluated 5 to 6 days later, and although the use of a test dose does not guarantee that patients will not experience myelosuppression, it is mandatory in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or other significant risk factors for hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia can rarely occur with the use of low-dose weekly methotrexate, even after single doses, and as pancytopenia may occur as long as 4 to 6 weeks after increasing the methotrexate dosage, more frequent monitoring is suggested with dosage increases. The literature suggests that significant myelosuppression is rare in appropriately monitored patients with psoriasis who have no risk factors for hematologic toxicity.

### Advances in systemic therapy for psoriasis [^1165pL9L]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Severe cases of psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis require systemic treatment. Although a number of established drugs are in clinical use, there is a need for new compounds with an improved risk-benefit ratio with a major emphasis on long-term safety. Furthermore, patients with moderate psoriasis ask for systemic drugs to make therapy easier and to avoid excessive local treatments. This article aims to give a brief overview about new drugs or groups of compounds together with an evaluation of their present status in the treatment of psoriasis and their future role with particular respect to efficacy, tolerability, safety and usability.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^1119asre]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, beyond the debated efficacy of colchicine across diverse clinical scenarios, its relatively narrow therapeutic window often results in frequent side effects and toxicity. As such, this underscores the necessity for a highly individualised treatment approach. The effects of colchicine are dose-dependent, with most adverse reactions being reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation. Currently, most clinically recommended low-dose regimens (0.5–0.6 mg), exhibit significant variability in treatment duration, often extending beyond one month. Additionally, dosage formulations differ by geographic region, with 0.6-mg tablets available in the United States and 0.5-mg tablets in Australia. The absence of comparative data on the efficacy and toxicity profiles of these formulations suggests that the differences in preparation strength are likely driven by commercial manufacturing considerations. Age-related prescribing disparities exist, with evidence favoring use in patients > 65 years old. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the disease suffered by patients has its own exploratory value, especially the impact of surgery on medication needs to be discussed in depth. We therefore analysed dosage, duration, geography, age, and disease of patients to refine clinical applicability.

Umbrella review, a useful tool, aimed at providing a relatively comprehensive understanding of published systematic reviews with meta-analyses on a specific topic recently. Considering the great controversy of the evidence, we conducted a umbrella review. Our primary aim was to comprehensively summarise the risks and benefits of colchicine use among patients with ASCVD based on meta-analyses of RCTs. The secondary aim was to identify the population that would benefit the most from colchicine use, thus supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making.

Efficacy on Pain

In all studies (Study 1, 2, and 3), pain intensity of the most affected joint (0–100 mm VAS) at 72 hours post-dose was consistently lower for patients treated with ILARIS compared with triamcinolone acetonide in the subpopulation of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine as shown in Table 9, and Figure 3 (Study 3). This benefit of ILARIS on pain intensity was comparable to the overall patient populations i.e., patients unable to use NSAIDs and/or colchicine in all three studies (see Table 9).

Time to New Flare

In the subpopulation of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3 unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, time to new flare over 12 weeks from randomization showed a reduction in the risk of a new flare when treated with ILARIS compared with triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg (see Table 10).

This risk reduction for a new flare after ILARIS treatment versus triamcinolone acetonide was comparable to the overall patient population over 12 weeks in all 3 studies (see Table 10).

### Colchicine for acute gout… [^111BLk7d]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should colchicine be used to treat acute gout. Evidence-Based Answer Low-quality evidence shows that low-dose colchicine is an effective therapy for acute gout. However, it has not been compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids in clinical trials. Concerns include high cost, drug-drug interactions, and potential toxicity. The high-dose regimens in the two studies — which included a 1- to 1. 2-mg loading dose, followed by either
0. 6 mg every hour for six hours or 0. 5 mg every two hours until therapeutic response or intolerance — caused significantly more adverse effects. The shorter, low-dose regimen of 1. 2 mg, followed by
0.

6 mg in one hour was as effective as the higher dosages in the more recent study, but with adverse effects similar to those in the placebo group. Using an outcome of at least 50% pain reduction at 24 to 32 hours with low-dose colchicine vs. placebo, the number needed to treat for the low-dose regimen was five. 2 For severe acute gout, colchicine may be used with NSAIDs or corticosteroids. The guidelines call for at least six months of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis while starting urate-lowering therapy to prevent gout flare-ups, and slightly favor colchicine in a dosage of 0. 6 mg once to twice daily in this regard. The dose of colchicine should be reduced for patients with severe renal or hepatic disease.

There is a 1% risk of reversible axonal neuromyopathy in patients taking colchicine; colchicine can cause rhabdomyolysis when used with statins or clarithromycin; and colchicine has multiple drug-drug interactions with cytochrome P3A4 inhibitors, including certain antiviral agents, antifungal agents, calcium channel blockers, and grapefruit. 3, 4 Comparative studies among the different treatments for acute gout and for flare-up prophylaxis are needed.

### Antirheumatic drugs for cardiovascular disease prevention: the case for colchicine [^1117eSVJ]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

What can we learn from these trials?

The favourable results for canakinumab and colchicine confirm (low-grade) inflammation as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and a new opportunity for treatment. The negative results in the MTX study do not detract from this, as the levels of CRP, IL-1β and IL-6 did not decrease during MTX treatment.

In addition, the large number of included patients yield important information on side effects: cancers, particularly non-basal cell skin cancers, occurred more often in the MTX group; the sample size of this study exceeds previous RCTs within the field of rheumatology with MTX. Remarkably, the occurrence of myalgias did not differ significantly between colchicine and placebo users. Whether or not colchicine leads to an increased risk of non-cardiovascular death needs to be elucidated.

The data on the favourable cardiovascular effects and safety of colchicine are convincing, and the drug costs are low. Moreover, all rheumatologists have experience in the long-term use with this drug and side effects are usually mild and rare, although colchicine must not be described in patients with advanced renal disease and might be limited by leucopenia and polyneuropathy. Perhaps the most burning question is: how to implement the findings of these studies? We have several recommendations:

First, we believe that cardiologists are not (yet) used to prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and may be somewhat reluctant to do that. Thus, our first-line action should be to initiate contact between the rheumatologist and the cardiologist and to discuss whether the additional use of an anti-inflammatory drug such as colchicine is an option in patients at high risk for secondary cardiovascular events.

### Current systemic therapies for psoriasis: where are we now? [^115tByZj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Many systemic agents are used in the treatment of psoriasis. They provide good control of psoriasis in the majority of patients and have improved their life quality indices. Frequently, combination therapy is utilized to synergize the efficacy of these medications. Many dermatologists are hesitant in prescribing systemic agents because of their adverse effects. However, such potential toxicities arising from these medications can largely be avoided if proper patient selection and close monitoring are performed.

Methotrexate — folate supplementation: "Although the majority of experts recommend that all patients treated with methotrexate receive folate supplementation (1–5 mg/d given daily except the day of methotrexate), others will add folate only if a patient develops gastrointestinal side effects or early bone-marrow toxicity as manifested by an increased mean corpuscular volume". If toxicity occurs despite folate, "increasing the dose of folate may be helpful". A literature review "suggests that low-dose folate supplementation may reduce the hematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic side effects of methotrexate without decreasing the efficacy", though "one small controlled study in patients with psoriasis using folic acid at 5 mg daily suggested that there may be a slight decrease in efficacy". "The optimal dosage of folic acid is still to be determined".

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^115F4PmE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with either skin or joints manifestations, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Despite multiple available treatments, their comparative efficacies and safety remain unclear due to the limited number of direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis to comprehensively compare systemic treatments.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of non-targeted systemic agents, targeted synthetic agents, and biologic targeted treatments for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to rank these treatments according to their benefits and harms.

Search Methods

For this update of the living systematic review, we updated our searches monthly up to July 2024 in the following databases and trial registers: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic pharmacological treatments in adults over 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, compared to placebo or another active agent, irrespective of dose and duration.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes were proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 and proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation).

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and analysis in duplicate. We synthesised data using pairwise and network meta-analyses to compare treatments and rank them according to effectiveness (PASI 90 score) and acceptability (inverse of SAEs). We assessed the certainty of network meta-analysis evidence for the two critical outcomes and all comparisons using CINeMA, as very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer treatment hierarchy, from 0% (worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (best for effectiveness or safety).

Included Studies

This update includes 26 new studies, taking the total number of included studies to 204, and randomised participants to 67,889 (67% men), mainly recruited from hospitals. The average age was 44.4 years, and the mean PASI score at baseline was 20.5 (range: 9.5 to 40). Most studies were placebo-controlled (56%). We assessed 26 treatments. Most (171) trials were multicentric (2 to 231 centres). Most studies (157/204) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 27 studies did not report a funding source.

Synthesis Of Results

Network meta-analysis at class level demonstrated that all interventions had a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than placebo. Anti-interleukin (IL)17 treatment showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 compared to all the interventions. Biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than the non-targeted systemic agents and the targeted systemic agents. For reaching PASI 90, the most effective drugs when compared to placebo were (in SUCRA rank order): infliximab (moderate-certainty evidence), xeligekimab (moderate-certainty), bimekizumab (high-certainty), ixekizumab (moderate-certainty), and risankizumab (moderate-certainty). Clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar when compared against each other. There was evidence of a difference in favour of bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab compared to secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab in achieving PASI 90. Infliximab, anti-IL17 drugs (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, sonelokimab, brodalumab), and anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab) showed evidence of a difference in achieving PASI 90 compared to ustekinumab, tildrakizumab, three anti-TNF-alpha agents (adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept), and deucravacitinib. Ustekinumab was superior to certolizumab. Adalimumab, tildrakizumab, and ustekinumab were superior to etanercept, deucravacitinib, and apremilast. Ciclosporin and methotrexate were superior to apremilast for reaching PASI 90. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low-certainty evidence for most comparisons. Therefore, the findings must be viewed with caution. For PASI 90, 31% of studies (51/165) had a high risk of bias, 34% (56 studies) had some concerns, and 35% (58) had low risk. For SAEs, 57% (94/169) had a high risk of bias, 31% (53 studies) had some concerns, and 13% (22 studies) had low risk.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review shows that, compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, xeligekimab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with high-certainty evidence for bimekizumab and moderate-certainty evidence for infliximab, xeligekimab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab. This network meta-analysis evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation), and is not sufficient for evaluating longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean 44.4 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20.5 at baseline) may not be typical of people seen in daily clinical practice. More randomised trials directly comparing active agents are needed, and these should include systematic subgroup analyses (sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis). To provide long-term information on the safety of treatments included in this review, an evaluation of non-randomised studies is needed. Our confidence in the results for non-targeted systemic treatments is limited due to concerns regarding study conduct. Further research is warranted and may modify these findings. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^111oZpq4]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacology and mechanism of action

When ingested, standard oral doses of 0.6–1 mg of colchicine are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations occurring ≈1 h after ingestion. However, peak concentrations occur later with higher doses (1.8 h with 1.8 mg and 4.5 h with 4.8 mg), suggesting a saturable influx transporter for colchicine in the gut wall. The oral bioavailability of colchicine is ≈50%, the volume of distribution is 5–8 l/kg and it has 40% protein binding to albumin. Colchicine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is present in the gut wall, kidneys, liver, and blood–brain barrier, with its primary function being to facilitate the export of xenobiotics such as colchicine out of the body to protect against toxicity. Colchicine is also metabolized by demethylation via cytochrome P4503A4, but < 5% of clearance is by this route. Around 10–20% is removed via renal excretion, and the majority of drug is eliminated as parent drug or metabolites in the faeces. Following a single 1 mg dose, colchicine plasma half-life is ≈4.4 h in young healthy adults, but this increases to 26–31 h following multiple oral doses of 0.6 mg twice daily, consistent with enterohepatic recycling (and possibly some auto-inhibition of clearance). The half-life will be even longer in older people, those with renal or hepatic dysfunction or those who have ingested toxic amounts. In people with moderate–severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 ml/min) colchicine clearance is halved and so the dose needs to be halved to reduce the risk of toxicity.

Cyclosporine — mechanism, role, and initial dosing in psoriasis: Cyclosporine received FDA approval for psoriasis in 1997 and is a potent immunosuppressant that functions by binding cyclophilin, which then inhibits calcineurin and blocks proinflammatory signaling; several inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ and IL-2, are consequently reduced, leading to decreased activation of T cells. Because of the long list of potential serious adverse effects, cyclosporine is not used as a long-term treatment for psoriasis. Nevertheless, it does have an important role as a rapid-acting medication for severe, recalcitrant disease, acute flares, and erythroderma. It can also be used as a bridge therapy in the transition to a safer long-term treatment. For dosage, some clinicians prefer to start at an intermediate dose of 2.5 to 3.0 mg/kg/day given twice daily for approximately 4 weeks before gradually increasing.

Generalized pustular psoriasis is uncommon in children and therapy is typically with systemic agents. While many drugs like oral retinoids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and spesolimab are used, colchicine is a safe and underutilized drug that acts by inhibition of neutrophils and the TNF-α-NF-kβ pathway. We report a case of a 10-year-old with generalized pustular psoriasis refractory to cyclosporine and methotrexate who achieved complete remission within 6weeks of colchicine monotherapy.

Psoriasis — cyclosporine (CSA) efficacy and relapse outcomes: Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of CSA in psoriasis. CSA given at 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/d for 12 to 16 weeks leads to rapid and dramatic improvement in psoriasis in up to 80% to 90% of patients. When dosed at 3 mg/kg/d, CSA leads to a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response in 50% to 70% of patients and a PASI 90 response in 30% to 50% of patients. In an open, multicentered, randomized trial of intermittent CSA courses during the course of 1 year, 400 patients were randomized to abrupt discontinuation or taper by 1 mg/kg/d weekly until cessation; the median time to relapse was 109 days after abrupt stop and 113 days after taper, and short, intermittent courses were generally well tolerated with 8% of patients discontinuing because of adverse events. For longer-term treatment, in a study of 217 patients treated for 6 to 30 months, 12.5% were successfully maintained on 1.25 mg/kg/d without loss of efficacy; in another study of 181 patients, after an induction phase with responders assigned to CSA 3.0, 1.5, or 0 mg/kg/d, 42% on 3 mg/kg/d relapsed compared with 84% on placebo.

0. 3 mg twice a day or 0. 6 mg once a day. However, in patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be 0. 3 mg/day and any increase in dose should be done with close monitoring. For the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients undergoing dialysis, the starting doses should be 0. 3 mg given twice a week with close monitoring. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended starting dose should be 0. 3 mg per day. Dosing can be increased with close monitoring. Any increase in dose should be done with adequate monitoring of the patient for adverse effects of colchicine.

### Methotrexate and psoriasis: 2009 National Psoriasis Foundation consensus conference [^113E9qn1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate remains a valuable option for the treatment of psoriasis. This report will summarize studies regarding the use of methotrexate since the last guidelines were published in 1998.

Objective

A task force of the National Psoriasis Foundation Medical Board was convened to evaluate treatment options. Our aim was to achieve a consensus on new updated guidelines for the use of methotrexate in the treatment of psoriasis.

Methods

Reports in the literature were reviewed regarding methotrexate therapy.

Results

A consensus was achieved on use of methotrexate in psoriasis including specific recommendations on dosing and monitoring. The consensus received unanimous approval from members of the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation.

Limitations

There are few evidence-based studies on the treatment of psoriasis with methotrexate. Many of the reviewed reports are for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Conclusions

Methotrexate is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of psoriasis. Appropriate patient selection and monitoring will significantly decrease the risks of side effects. In patients without risk factors for hepatic fibrosis, liver biopsies may not be indicated or the frequency of liver biopsies may be markedly reduced.

Psoriasis — cyclosporine dosing and bridging use states that the maintenance oral dose typically used is 3.0 to 3.5 mg/kg/d, and a short course can be used in severe flares as rescue or bridging therapy because of its rapid onset of action until an alternative maintenance treatment is instituted; overlapping cyclosporine with methotrexate (MTX) or biologic therapies can avoid further deterioration while the new drug takes effect, after which cyclosporine can be withdrawn without the danger of flaring and with minimal risk of side effects for the short period of simultaneous use.

### Colchicine: an ancient drug with novel applications [^115AFzvR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Colchicine is a treatment for gout that has been used for more than a millennium. It is the treatment of choice for familial Mediterranean fever and its associated complication, amyloidosis. The 2009 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of colchicine as a new drug had research consequences. Recent investigations with large cohorts of patients with gout who have been taking colchicine for years have demonstrated novel applications within oncology, immunology, cardiology and dermatology. Some emerging dermatological uses include the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, leucocytoclastic vasculitis, aphthous stomatitis and others. In this work we relate the history and the new horizon of this ancient medicine.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^116mq3Kv]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Explanation — Authors should describe each intervention thoroughly, including control interventions. The description should allow a clinician wanting to use the intervention to know exactly how to administer the intervention that was evaluated in the trial. For a drug intervention, information would include the drug name, dose, method of administration (such as oral, intravenous), timing and duration of administration, conditions under which interventions are withheld, and titration regimen if applicable. If the control group is to receive "usual care" it is important to describe thoroughly what that constitutes. If the control group or intervention group is to receive a combination of interventions the authors should provide a thorough description of each intervention, an explanation of the order in which the combination of interventions are introduced or withdrawn, and the triggers for their introduction if applicable.

Specific extensions of the CONSORT statement address the reporting of non-pharmacologic and herbal interventions and their particular reporting requirements (such as expertise, details of how the interventions were standardised). We recommend readers consult the statements for non-pharmacologic and herbal interventions as appropriate.

Item 6a. Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed

Example — "The primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion of patients achieving a 75% improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to 12 weeks as measured by the PASI [psoriasis area and severity index] Additional analyses were done on the percentage change in PASI scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions".

Explanation — All RCTs assess response variables, or outcomes (end points), for which the groups are compared. Most trials have several outcomes, some of which are of more interest than others. The primary outcome measure is the pre-specified outcome considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders (such a patients, policy makers, clinicians, funders) and is usually the one used in the sample size calculation (see item 7). Some trials may have more than one primary outcome. Having several primary outcomes, however, incurs the problems of interpretation associated with multiplicity of analyses (see items 18 and 20) and is not recommended. Primary outcomes should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of an RCT. Other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes (additional outcomes). There may be several secondary outcomes, which often include unanticipated or unintended effects of the intervention (see item 19), although harms should always be viewed as important whether they are labelled primary or secondary.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^116FWUkM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this fourth of 6 sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we discuss the use of traditional systemic medications for the treatment of patients with psoriasis. Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. We will discuss in detail the efficacy and safety, and offer recommendations for the use of the 3 most commonly used, and approved, traditional systemic agents: methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin. We will also briefly discuss the available data for the use of azathioprine, fumaric acid esters, hydroxyurea, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus, and 6-thioguanine in psoriasis.

Psoriasis — cyclosporine (CSA) dosing and administration outlines that CSA should be administered at a consistent time of the day and in relation to meals, and the solution can be mixed with milk or orange juice but not with grapefruit juice. The initial daily dose of CSA is 2.5 to 3 mg/kg in two divided doses, generally maintained for 4 weeks and then increased in increments of 0.5 mg/kg/d until disease control is achieved. Although the package insert recommends that the maximal daily dosage should be 4 mg/kg/d, the customary maximum psoriasis dose is 5 mg/kg/d. Another approach in more severe disease is to initiate treatment at the highest dosage, typically 5 mg/kg/d, with stepwise decreases after adequate disease control is achieved.

Methotrexate hepatotoxicity monitoring in patients with risk factors advises stricter measures: "Consider the use of a different systemic agent", "Consider delayed baseline liver biopsy (after 2–6 mo of therapy to establish medication efficacy and tolerability)", and "Repeated liver biopsies after approximately 1–1.5 g of methotrexate". The text notes "Patients with one or more risk factors for hepatotoxicity need be followed up with the more stringent guidelines (Table IV)", and if methotrexate is still used, "this patient should have a liver biopsy performed at or near the beginning of methotrexate therapy", though "As some patients will discontinue methotrexate within 2 to 6 months because of adverse effects or lack of clinical effectiveness, it is sensible to postpone the early treatment liver biopsy until after this initial period". For ongoing risk, "a repeated biopsy should be performed at a cumulative dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g", "a liver biopsy is also indicated" for "persistent significant abnormalities in liver chemistry values", and biopsy "should be repeated with every additional 1.0 to 1.5 g of methotrexate".

Methotrexate in psoriasis therapy — Table III recommendations: Methotrexate is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. Methotrexate is less effective than adalimumab and infliximab for cutaneous psoriasis. Methotrexate is efficacious for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral arthritis, but not for axial involvement); in psoriatic arthritis, the efficacy of methotrexate is lower than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors. Recommended methotrexate dosage typically ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg weekly, and the dose can be given as a single dose or in 3 doses over 24 hours. Methotrexate can be administered orally or subcutaneously. A test dose should be considered, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Administration of folic acid or folinic acid is recommended to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic adverse effects, and large folic acid and folinic acid doses may reduce the efficacy of methotrexate. Combination therapy with methotrexate and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy can be considered for adult patients with generalized plaque psoriasis to enhance efficacy and lower cumulative doses of both treatments.
