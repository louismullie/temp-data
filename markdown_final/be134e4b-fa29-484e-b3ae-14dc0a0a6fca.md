## Question

Ice skin burn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "ice skin burn", covering definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, first aid, advanced management, prevention, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology so we don't conflate cold burns with thermal burns. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and temperature thresholds that distinguish frostbite from nonfreezing cold injury. Next, I will review clinical presentations and classification. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish mimics. Then, I will examine first aid management, including when and how to use ice safely, and when to avoid it. I should confirm advanced care pathways, including rapid rewarming and thrombolytics. Finally, I will consider prevention, special populations, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't talk past each other. "Ice skin burn" is not a standard medical term; it colloquially refers to a cold-induced injury that can be either frostbite (freezing) or a nonfreezing cold injury such as frostnip or immersion foot, and in some contexts people also misuse it to describe iatrogenic cryotherapy or even deliberate "salt and ice challenge" burns, so I need to be precise about these entities and their mechanisms before proceeding [^113aihUq] [^112Kk247] [^115ivyMr].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology of frostbite, since that is the prototypical "ice burn". Wait, let me verify the temperature thresholds: in air, tissue freezing typically begins around −3°C, and in saltwater even higher at about −0.55°C, with extracellular ice crystals forming first and intracellular ice later; rapid rewarming is critical because thawing triggers reperfusion injury with inflammatory and prothrombotic cascades that worsen tissue loss if not managed promptly [^112LNA9x] [^1128hBEc].

> Next, I should review nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI), because patients may call immersion foot or chilblains an "ice burn" too. Hold on, I should verify the exposure conditions: NFCI arises when extremities are exposed to cold-wet environments, often with water temperatures below about 15°C for prolonged periods, producing a vasoneuropathy with sensory loss and delayed hyperemic pain; importantly, NFCI is not progressive after the first few days, so worsening symptoms should prompt a search for other causes [^115iKcmM] [^117MH4VF] [^1175g9eZ].

> Let me consider the clinical presentations and classification so I don't jump to conclusions. Frostbite severity ranges from superficial (first–second degree) with pallor, numbness, and clear blisters to deep (third–fourth degree) with hemorrhagic blisters, woody firmness, and tissue loss; field classification often simplifies to superficial versus deep, and the Hennepin and Cauchy scores help quantify severity and predict amputation risk after thawing [^116kh8Vj] [^112MtEWZ] [^114YqfWs]. For NFCI, the hallmark is cold-numb extremities for more than 30 minutes with a painful rewarming phase and, in chronic cases, persistent cold sensitivity and abnormal pinprick sensation, which help distinguish it from mimics [^111nqgDy] [^115iKcmM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without a careful differential. I need to ensure we separate frostbite from NFCI, pressure necrosis, infection, and Raynaud phenomenon using exposure history and tissue characteristics; frostbite requires subfreezing exposure and frozen tissue feels firm or waxy, whereas NFCI occurs in cold-wet conditions above freezing and lacks intratissue ice crystals, and worsening after 2–3 days should trigger reassessment for other causes [^114DWHeJ] [^111hjpa6] [^1175g9eZ].

> Now, first aid management — this is where confusion about "ice" often arises. My first instinct is to say "never use ice on burns", but wait, I should verify the nuance: for thermal burns, immediate cooling with clean running water is first-line and superior, and ice is generally discouraged because of vasoconstriction and risk of further tissue injury; however, if clean running water is unavailable, it may be reasonable to cool a superficial burn with ice wrapped in cloth for no more than about 10 minutes to mitigate frostbite risk, and compression with ice should be avoided [^117Nn6Wv] [^114Z5WNe]. I should double-check the temperature data: animal and translational work suggests ice water can worsen necrosis compared with cool tap water, reinforcing the preference for 12–18°C water when available [^116n1MtX].

> For frostbite, I need to ensure I don't recommend anything that worsens injury. The priority is to protect from further cold, keep the part frozen if refreezing is likely, and initiate rapid rewarming only when refreezing can be avoided; field rewarming should use a 37–39°C water bath with temperature monitoring and no dry heat sources, and analgesia should be provided during rewarming because pain is expected [^113Ym5Nd] [^115tfsZy] [^111RMeLF]. But wait, what if logistics are limited? If rapid rewarming is not feasible and refreezing is likely, it is reasonable to delay thawing until definitive care, as freeze–thaw cycles are particularly damaging [^113Ym5Nd] [^115wNhw3].

> For NFCI, I should confirm that the approach is different. Immediate actions include removing wet clothing, gentle passive rewarming, and avoiding further cold-wet exposure; unlike frostbite, there is no role for rapid warm-water immersion, and prevention of recurrence is key because repeated cooling–rewarming cycles increase morbidity and persistence of symptoms [^117DTcsd] [^111nqgDy].

> Next, I should review advanced management and when to escalate. Hospital care for frostbite centers on rapid rewarming in a monitored setting, early consideration of thrombolytics or iloprost in severe cases to mitigate the ischemia–inflammation–coagulation triad, and delayed surgical decisions until clear demarcation; evidence is limited but suggests iloprost and iloprost plus rtPA may reduce amputations compared with buflomedil alone, albeit with very low certainty [^1128hBEc] [^117M2rer] [^112LZE5m]. I need to ensure imaging and vascular assessment are used to guide interventions and that quality metrics emphasize time-to-rewarming and thrombolytic evaluation to improve outcomes [^112LZE5m].

> I should confirm prevention strategies and counseling points, especially for at-risk populations. Prevention hinges on layered, dry clothing, minimizing exposure of ears, nose, cheeks, hands, and feet, avoiding tight footwear, staying hydrated and nourished, and maintaining vigilance for early numbness; in military or occupational settings, regular rotation out of cold-wet environments is the mainstay to prevent NFCI, and public health messaging should address dangerous "challenges" like salt and ice that cause predictable second-degree burns [^117DTcsd] [^115ivyMr] [^112LNA9x].

> Special populations and scenarios deserve attention. In children, I need to ensure burn cooling is carefully monitored for hypothermia, and in older adults or those with comorbidities, I should have a lower threshold for transport and advanced care; for iatrogenic cryotherapy injuries, insulation strategies and temperature monitoring can mitigate flank "ice burns" during renal cryoablation, underscoring that even controlled cold can cause localized injury if unprotected [^117Nn6Wv] [^111m6PFB].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the key takeaways so I don't miss anything critical. "Ice skin burn" is a misnomer that encompasses frostbite, NFCI, and sometimes deliberate cold-contact burns; management diverges by mechanism, with cool running water preferred for thermal burns and rapid, controlled rewarming for frostbite, while NFCI requires gentle rewarming and prevention of recurrence; ice can be used briefly with insulation for superficial thermal burns only when water is unavailable, but prolonged or direct ice risks cold injury and should be avoided; and across all scenarios, I need to ensure careful monitoring for hypothermia, pain control, and timely escalation to definitive care when indicated [^117Nn6Wv] [^113Ym5Nd] [^117DTcsd].

Ice burns are **cold-induced injuries** from prolonged skin contact with ice or frozen objects, causing numbness, tingling, pain, and color changes (white, gray, blue, or black) [^113aihUq]. Immediate first aid is to **remove the cold source and rewarm gradually** in warm (37–39°C) water for 15–30 minutes [^113Ym5Nd]; avoid direct heat, rubbing, or massage. Most superficial injuries heal without scarring, but deeper tissue damage can cause permanent numbness, cold sensitivity, or tissue loss [^113aihUq]. Prevention centers on limiting ice exposure, using barriers, and monitoring for numbness or color change [^112LNA9x].

---

## Pathophysiology

Ice burns result from **prolonged exposure to cold**, causing:

- **Vasoconstriction**: Reduced blood flow, ischemia, and hypoxia.
- **Ice crystal formation**: Intracellular and extracellular crystals damage cells and tissues [^113aihUq].
- **Reperfusion injury**: Reactive oxygen species and inflammation on rewarming worsen tissue damage [^1128hBEc].

---

## Clinical presentation

Ice burns present with:

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Numbness <br/> - Tingling <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Superficial blisters |
| Moderate | - Clear blisters <br/> - Edema <br/> - Mottled skin <br/> - Persistent numbness |
| Severe | - Hemorrhagic blisters <br/> - Black eschar <br/> - Tissue necrosis <br/> - Permanent sensory loss |

---

## Immediate first aid treatment

Immediate actions include:

- **Remove cold source**: Stop exposure immediately.
- **Gradual rewarming**: Immerse in warm water (37–39°C) for 15–30 minutes [^113Ym5Nd].
- **Avoid rapid rewarming**: Do not use direct heat, hot water, or heating pads.
- **Do not rub or massage**: This can worsen tissue damage.
- **Elevate**: Reduce swelling and improve circulation.
- **Analgesia**: Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain [^111RMeLF].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **infection**, delayed wound healing, permanent numbness or sensory loss, cold sensitivity, and tissue necrosis requiring surgical intervention [^113aihUq].

---

## Long-term effects

Long-term effects may include **chronic neuropathic pain**, permanent sensory deficits, cold intolerance, and cosmetic disfigurement or scarring [^112eWYFs].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on:

- **Limit exposure**: Avoid prolonged ice contact.
- **Use barriers**: Place cloth or towel between ice and skin [^114Z5WNe].
- **Monitor skin**: Watch for numbness or color change [^112LNA9x].
- **Educate**: Teach safe cryotherapy use [^notfound].

---

## Medical interventions

Medical care may involve **tetanus prophylaxis**, topical or systemic antibiotics for infection, surgical debridement or amputation for severe cases, and physical therapy to restore function and mobility [^117M2rer].

---

Ice burns are preventable cold injuries; **prompt, gradual rewarming** and avoiding direct heat or friction are key to minimizing tissue damage and complications [^113Ym5Nd].

### Is ice right? Does cryotherapy improve outcome for acute soft tissue injury? [^113cbNNq]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

The use of ice or cryotherapy in the management of acute soft tissue injuries is widely accepted and widely practised. This review was conducted to examine the medical literature to investigate if there is evidence to support an improvement in clinical outcome following the use of ice or cryotherapy.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed and all human and animal trials or systematic reviews pertaining to soft tissue trauma, ice or cryotherapy were assessed. The clinically relevant outcome measures were (1) a reduction in pain; (2) a reduction in swelling or oedema; (3) improved function; or (4) return to participation in normal activity.

Results

Six relevant trials in humans were identified, four of which lacked randomisation and blinding. There were two well conducted randomised controlled trials, one showing supportive evidence for the use of a cooling gel and the other not reaching statistical significance. Four animal studies showed that modest cooling reduced oedema but excessive or prolonged cooling is damaging. There were two systematic reviews, one of which was inconclusive and the other suggested that ice may hasten return to participation.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to suggest that cryotherapy improves clinical outcome in the management of soft tissue injuries.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) — staging and symptom course are characterized as follows: In severe NFCI, affected extremities pass through 4 stages, and the most common initial symptom is loss of sensation lasting > 30 min. The third stage usually begins abruptly and can last as long as 6 to 10 wk in severe cases. Cold sensitivity may begin at any time, as long as 6 wk after the injury. NFCI is not a progressive condition; the worst symptoms occur in the first few days, and afterward, symptoms usually improve or remain stable, so worsening symptoms should not be attributed to NFCI.

Thermal burn cooling after injury — benefits, duration, and ice use: Cooling of burns with running water is an established and beneficial intervention with little risk of harm, and a meta-analysis of observational data (7 studies, 11 383 adults and children) suggests a decrease in the need for subsequent care with immediate active cooling with clean running water. Because preadolescent children are more likely to develop hypothermia, a study of 117 children receiving whole-body cooling reported that 5 children (4%) developed hypothermia or were visibly cold with shivering. An ILCOR meta-analysis of 4 studies involving 5978 adults and children concluded that the ideal cooling duration is unknown, but leading organizations recommend active cooling durations of 5 to 20 minutes. If cool or cold clean running water is unavailable and ice is used, it should be placed in a cloth or towel and limited to 10 minutes to prevent frostbite injury, and there is risk of additional tissue damage when ice is used with compression.

### A review of first aid treatments for burn injuries [^117UBJgJ]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

Throughout history there have been many different and sometimes bizarre treatments prescribed for burns. Unfortunately many of these treatments still persist today, although they often do not have sufficient evidence to support their use. This paper reviews common first aid and pre-hospital treatments for burns (water — cold or warm, ice, oils, powders and natural plant therapies), possible mechanisms whereby they might work and the literature which supports their use. From the published work to date, the current recommendations for the first aid treatment of burn injuries should be to use cold running tap water (between 2 and 15 degrees C) on the burn, not ice or alternative plant therapies.

Accidental hypothermia — protection of cold skin and burn monitoring: It is important to visually inspect the heated skin at regular intervals (eg, 20 to 30 min) to observe for excess reddening or other signs of pending burns; in these cases, active heating should be stopped in the affected areas. Heated pads should be applied with great caution to areas such as the back that are difficult to visualize or under constant pressure from body weight or immobilization systems. Recommendation. Avoid localized pressure to cold skin. Apply heat sources according to manufacturer instructions; this often precludes direct contact with the skin by placing some thin insulating material between the skin and heat source to prevent burning the skin (Evidence grade: 1C). Skin should be assessed every 20 to 30 min for excess reddening or other signs of impending thermal burns when active heat sources are being applied (Evidence grade: 1C).

Classification of frostnip — Frostnip is a superficial nonfreezing cold injury on exposed skin with intense vasoconstriction, is distinct from and may precede frostbite, and features no intratissue ice crystal formation or tissue loss; numbness and pallor resolve quickly after warming by clothing, direct contact, cupped-hand breathing, or shelter; no long-term damage occurs; and it signals conditions favorable for frostbite so appropriate action should be undertaken immediately to prevent injury.

2024 American Heart Association and American Red Cross Guidelines for First Aid — knowledge gaps and priorities of research emphasize that overall there is a lack of first aid research, most evidence was indirect to first aid and extrapolated from in-hospital settings, and research evaluating care by first aid providers in the first aid setting is urgently needed; first aid research (and guideline development) should include the active involvement of individuals who provide first aid and who are in groups targeted by first aid guidelines. Key gaps include which "red flag" signs and symptoms are most important for first aid providers to learn to identify; the role of positioning in decreased level of alertness and the effect of passive leg raise; the effectiveness and safety of oxygen and the accuracy and role of pulse oximeters; barriers to assisting individuals to take their own medication and the most effective rewarming methods for hypothermia and frostbite; how best to assess severity of hypothermia and measure core temperature; whether untrained rescuers can effectively apply tourniquets and the effectiveness of indirect manual pressure; how to manage open chest wounds; whether splinting long-bone fractures reduces pain or improves outcome; and the ideal cooling method and duration for thermal burns in the first aid setting.

### Prevention and treatment of nonfreezing cold injuries and warm water immersion tissue injuries: a supplement to the Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines [^1175g9eZ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) — diagnostic recommendations include contextual thresholds and timelines: In conditions sufficient to cause significant peripheral cooling, especially in a wet, cold environment with a water temperature < 15°C (59°F), a victim with an extremity that has been cold and numb for hours to days may have NFCI (1C). A victim who is asymptomatic, with a normal physical examination and no persistent neurologic symptoms after rewarming, does not have NFCI (1C). When neurologic symptoms or signs persist beyond 1 wk after cold exposure affecting 1 or more extremities and other causes of peripheral neuropathy have been excluded, the diagnosis is likely NFCI (1C). Worsening of symptoms attributed to NFCI after the first 2 to 3 d following the injury should prompt a search for other causes (1C).

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^112QvLFN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for hypothermia — core actions include the following. A person with signs and symptoms of hypothermia should be protected from further heat loss by moving to a warm environment, removing saturated clothing, allowing passive rewarming with blankets, and actively rewarming if resources are available. If immediate movement to warmth is not possible, protect against heat loss by insulating from the ground, covering the head and neck, and shielding from wind using a plastic or foil layer in addition to a dry insulating layer. When using rewarming devices, follow the manufacturer's instructions, place insulation between the heat source and skin, and frequently monitor for burns and pressure injury. If hypothermia is accompanied by decreased responsiveness or concerning features such as pallor, cyanosis, or frozen skin, activate the emergency response system while rewarming by any available method. For patients with cold stress or mild hypothermia who are alert and can safely consume oral food or fluids, it is recommended to provide high‑calorie foods or drinks. If a person with hypothermia with decreased responsiveness is wearing damp clothing and cannot be immediately moved to warmth, initiating active rewarming through the damp clothing using the hypothermia wrap technique with chemical heat blankets, plastic or foil layers, and insulative blankets is reasonable. Body‑to‑body rewarming is not beneficial compared with other active rewarming techniques such as chemical heat packs or forced air systems.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113aihUq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2019 update [^112WkBmG]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Frostnip — superficial nonfreezing cold injury is described as superficial nonfreezing cold injury associated with intense vasoconstriction on exposed skin, usually cheeks, ears, or nose, and is distinct from and may precede frostbite; with frostnip, ice crystals do not form within the tissue and tissue loss does not occur, numbness and pallor resolve quickly after warming the skin with appropriate clothing, direct contact, breathing with cupped hands over the nose, or gaining shelter, no long-term damage occurs, and frostnip signals conditions favorable for frostbite so appropriate action should be undertaken immediately to prevent injury.

### Effect of ice water injection toward the duodenal papilla for preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis: study protocol for a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (EUTOPIA study) [^112M3AWP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an essential procedure in the diagnosis and treatment of biliopancreatic diseases. The most common adverse event of ERCP is post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), which can sometimes be severe. Our previous study suggested that injecting ice water at the end of ERCP suppressed PEP, and we decided to investigate this effect in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Methods

This study is being conducted at eight hospitals in Japan starting in April 2022. Patients undergoing ERCP will be randomized to ice water group and control group. In the ice water group, 250 mL of ice water is injected toward the papilla at the end of ERCP. The next morning, a physical examination and blood tests are performed to evaluate for the development of pancreatitis. The goal is to have 440 cases in each group.

Discussion

The main cause of PEP is thought to be papilla edema. Cooling the papilla, as everyone naturally does at the time of a burn, is expected to prevent its inflammation and edema. Various methods to suppress PEP have been reported, but so far none of them are reliable. The method we have devised is very simple, easy, and safe. We hope that our study will change the world's ERCP common practice.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^114ptiwC]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for accidental hypothermia, more specifically with respect to out-of-hospital management (active rewarming), WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid exposing localized pressure to cold skin. Apply heat sources according to manufacturer instructions, place some thin insulating material between the skin and heat source to prevent burning the skin, to preclude direct contact with the skin. Assess skin every 20–30 minutes for excess reddening or other signs of impending thermal burns when active heat sources are being applied.

### Local cooling does not prevent hyperalgesia following burn injury in humans [^1145UdAK]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

One of the oldest methods of pain relief following a burn injury is local application of ice or cold water. Experimental data indicate that cooling may also reduce the severity of tissue injury and promote wound healing, but there are no controlled studies in humans evaluating the anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperalgesic potential of early cooling after thermal injury. Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in this randomized, single-blinded study. Following baseline measurements, which included inflammatory variables (skin temperature, erythema index) and sensory variables (thermal and mechanical detection thresholds, thermal and mechanical pain responses, area of secondary hyperalgesia), first degree burn injuries were induced on both calves by contact thermodes (12.5 cm², 47 degrees C for 7 min). Eight minutes after the burn injury, contact thermodes (12.5 cm²) were again applied on the burns. One of the thermodes cooled the burn (8 degrees C for 30 min) whereas the other thermode was a non-active dummy on the control burn. Inflammatory and sensory variables were followed for 160 min after end of the cooling procedure. The burn injury induced significant increases in skin temperature (P < 0.0005), erythema index (P < 0.0001), thermal pain responses (P < 0.0005), mechanical pain responses (P < 0.005) and secondary hyperalgesia, and significant decreases in heat pain threshold (P < 0.0005) and mechanical pain threshold (P < 0.0005). There were no post-cooling effects on skin temperature (P > 0.5), erythema (P > 0.9), heat pain threshold (P > 0.5), thermal or mechanical pain responses (P > 0.5) or the development of secondary hyperalgesia (P > 0.4) compared with the control burn. However, a significant, albeit transient, increase in cold detection threshold was observed on the cooled burn side (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, cooling with 8 degrees C for 30 min following a first degree burn injury in humans does not attenuate inflammatory or hyperalgesic responses compared with a placebo-treated control burn.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^112cLQh6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cold urticaria — presentation, confirmation, and management: "Subjects with cold urticaria have pruritus and swelling with exposure of the skin to a cold stimulus", and "might have systemic reactions associated with systemic cold exposure (eg, aquatic activities)". Diagnosis "can be confirmed by applying a cold stimulus to the patient's skin and observing a wheal-and-flare reaction during rewarming of the skin". The "primary treatment for cold urticaria is avoidance of cold exposure, as feasible; however, prescribing pharmacotherapy is also frequently advisable", and "Some forms of cold urticaria might have a negative ice cube test result".

### Case series of non-freezing cold injury: the modern clinical syndrome [^111nqgDy]. BMJ Military Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI) occurs when peripheral tissue is damaged by cold exposure but not to the extent of freezing. Historically, the phenotype of NFCIs sustained was severe, whereas today the spectrum of injury represented in the UK military predominantly comprises subtler injuries. The diagnostic challenge of recognising these injuries, both in the acute and chronic settings, can lead to mismanagement and subsequent morbidity.

Methods

We characterised a recent case series of 100 UK Service Personnel referred with suspected NFCI to a Military UK NFCI clinic. We characterised the acute and chronic phenotype of those diagnosed with NFCI (n = 76) and made comparison to those who received alternate diagnoses (n = 24), to find discriminatory symptoms and signs.

Results

The most common acute symptoms of NFCI were the extremities becoming cold to the point of loss of feeling for more than 30 min (sensitivity 96%, specificity 90%, p < 0.001), followed by a period of painful rewarming (sensitivity 81%, specificity 67%, p < 0.001). In-field foot/hand inspections took place in half of the NFCI cases. Importantly, remaining in the field and undergoing multiple cycles of cooling and rewarming after an initial NFCI was associated with having double the risk of the NFCI persisting for more than a week. The most common and discriminant chronic symptoms and signs of NFCI were having extremities that behave differently during cold exposures (sensitivity 81%, specificity 75%, p < 0.001) and having abnormal pinprick sensation in the affected extremity (sensitivity 88%, specificity 88%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A small collection of symptoms and signs characterise acute and chronic NFCIs and distinguish this vasoneuropathy from NFCI mimics.

First aid for burns — cool water therapy parameters and cautions include removal of ongoing heat sources and specific irrigation practices: Clothing may continue to smolder, so any ongoing fire should be extinguished and burned material should be removed from patients, and jewelry and any items that may tighten or constrict over time should be removed from all extremities with a careful vascular exam. Burns of < 10% total body surface area (TBSA) should be irrigated with water that is 12 to 18°C (53–64°F) for 20 to 30 min, starting as soon as possible after the burn occurs, and immersion in cold water is acceptable if no running water is available; cool water therapy remains effective if initiated within 60 min of injury. Potable water is preferred to untreated surface water, ice should not be used, and the authors recommend against direct application of snow to burn wounds, although snow may be used to cool water for treatment. Use of cool water therapy is associated with reduced burn depth, lower TBSA, less need for skin grafting, and shorter time to healing and may aid in pain control, but hypothermia is more common in patients with larger TBSA burns and is associated with increased mortality with risk factors including prolonged scene time, older age, need for airway management, and altered mental status. We recommend that burn wounds of < 10% TBSA be irrigated with cool running water for 20 min. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### A frosty challenge [^115ivyMr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a case of geometrical skin lesions in a teenage patient.

Case

A previously healthy 14-year-old boy presented in our pediatric emergency department with unusual skin lesions on his left forearm. The patient said the lesions started 2 weeks earlier following a spider bite. His physical examination revealed an otherwise healthy child with no medical history with raised square lesions of the left forearm. The lesions were in different stages of healing and resembled second-degree burns. Examination showed no other lesions. Vital signs were normal. The patient was discharged after the lesions were dressed with antibiotic ointment. A follow-up consultation was scheduled a week later, but the patient did not attend the follow-up consultation. A senior emergency physician called the family and learned that the lesions were progressively healing and no other lesions appeared. The teen admitted he played the "salt and ice challenge".

Discussion

The salt and ice challenge involves putting salt on the skin and then applying and/or pressing ice cubes on top of the salt. The challenge is to resist the pain consecutive to frostbite for as long as possible. The result is often second-degree burns and possible partial third-degree burns.

Conclusions

Because of the current popularity of this practice, emergency or family physicians, pediatricians, dermatologists, and burn or orthopedic surgery units might encounter these injuries. When young patients present with geometrical burn injuries and unexplained or bizarre circumstances, self-inflicted burn "challenges" should be considered.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113JnJ4P]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

### Frostbite of the extremities-recognition, evaluation and treatment [^114MLNS5]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Frostbite refers to the freezing of body tissue which is caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures and results in tissue destruction. Tissue damage is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. A detailed treatment plan based on the current UpToDate literature is needed to decrease morbidity and mortality rates.

Methods

The United States National Library of Medicine (PubMed/Medline), EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify publications relevant to this review.

Conclusion

In this review, we present the current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of frostbite injuries. We then provide an extended and detailed treatment plan, from first aid in the field to treatment of short and long-term complications.

### Cooling of burns: mechanisms and models [^115HKJcH]. Burns (2015). Low credibility.

The role of cooling in the acute management of burns is widely accepted in clinical practice, and is a cornerstone of basic first aid in burns. This has been underlined in a number of animal models. The mechanism by which it delivers its benefit is poorly understood, but there is a reduction in burns progression over the first 48 h, reduced healing time, and some subjective improvements in scarring when cooling is administered after burning. Intradermal temperature normalises within a matter of seconds to a few minutes, yet the benefits of even delayed cooling persist, implying it is not simply the removal of thermal energy from the damaged tissues. Animal models have used oedema formation, preservation of dermal perfusion, healing time and hair retention as indicators of burns severity, and have shown cooling to improve these indices, but pharmacological or immunological blockade of humoural and cellular mediators of inflammation did not reproduce the benefit of cooling. More recently, some studies of tissue from human and animal burns have shown consistent, reproducible, temporal changes in gene expression in burned tissues. Here, we review the experimental evidence of the role and mechanism of cooling in burns management, and suggest future research directions that may eventually lead to improved treatment outcomes.

### Frostbite of the hand [^115gVbjk]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Frostbite is damage caused by the freezing of tissue owing to exposure to extreme cold. Clinically, it is often difficult to identify the severity of frostbite injury. There may be a wide discrepancy between the extent of damage to the skin versus that to the deeper structures. The initial clinical impression is usually worse than actual tissue damage. In addition to physical examination, diagnostic imaging, especially triple-phase bone scan, has been proposed to help differentiate between superficial and deep damage. Principles of treatment involve rapid rewarming to thaw the tissues and halt direct cellular damage, methods to minimize progressive dermal ischemia, and active wound care to promote timely healing. Pharmacological adjuncts, such as fibrinolytics, have been proposed to minimize tissue damage. Surgical therapy is postponed until there is clear demarcation between healthy and necrotic tissue.

### Use of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy for acute treatment of frostbite in 62 patients with review of thrombolytic therapy in frostbite [^115ox5Jc]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Local cold injury is poorly understood by most physicians and clinical presentations can include frostnip, chilblains, flash freeze injury, and cold contact injury, as well as frostbite (Table 1). Frostnip and chilblains (sometimes referred to as near-freeze injuries) do not blister or necrose tissue, and do not require surgical intervention. Flash-freeze injury and cold contact injuries are rarely circumferential and initiate such rapid cooling that large intracellular ice crystals form which rupture and immediately kill the affected cells. Frostbite, the most common form of injury, occurs with slower rates of cooling and can mimic laboratory cryopreservation, where small ice crystals form initially in the extravascular space. Unlike flash freeze and cold contact injuries, soft tissue cells can potentially survive after thawing, if vascular infarction can be prevented.

Table 1.
Classification of local cold injury*

Length of exposure to cold, duration of ice in tissue, and rapidity of rewarming are important determinants of tissue damage in frostbite patients. Rapid rewarming of frozen tissue is the treatment that consistently reduces the severity of frostbite injury. – Most U.S. burn centers then follow a wound protocol adapted from McCauley et al, and the thawed digits are observed for signs of injury (Table 2). Either perfusion is restored and maintained in the affected digits, or progressive ischemia leads to tissue necrosis. Multiple interventions have failed to prevent frostbite thrombosis, including heparin, dextran, intraarterial (IA) reserpine (sympathetic block), and surgical sympathectomy. – Thrombolytic therapy using IA infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has shown promise in animal models, and at least two clinical case series; however, recent published results of IV thrombolytic infusion are less impressive.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113y9a4D]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia/Cold exposure — patient safety considerations during rewarming: Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the cold environment as soon as operationally feasible. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these patients to stand or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse. Devices that self-generate heat that are being utilized during the rewarming process should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent burns, and available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45°C (113°F) are most likely to cause burns; in patients who are unresponsive, or unable to recognize a developing injury, check the area regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of severe frostbite [^1128hBEc]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Severe frostbite — pathophysiology and treatment principles: Frostbite injury involves ischemia, inflammation, and coagulation, and frostbite‑related tissue damage occurs in two phases with a reperfusion injury upon rewarming characterized by inflammatory and prothrombotic mediator release. Diminishing the toxic triad of ischemia, inflammation, and coagulation and restoring blood flow to prevent irreversible ischemia is the goal of treatment. Most treatment algorithms focus on rapid rewarming, and surgical treatment is guided by diagnostic imaging after the traditional teaching of watchful waiting for clinical demarcation prior to definitive surgery; ideally, successful treatment preserves limb length and soft tissue to decrease sequela and reduce disability.

### Management of burns [^113vX7Xy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on burn injury:

- **Definition**: Burn injuries are defined as damage to the skin or other body tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of burn injuries involves the destruction of skin layers, which triggers an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and potentially distributive shock.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of burn injury in the US is estimated at 140 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for burn injuries include self-inflicted injuries or abuse/neglect, lack of social support resources, inadequate housing and food resources, and substance use disorders, including alcohol.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, burn injuries present with redness, blistering, and skin damage. The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the depth and extent of the burn. Superficial burns may only cause redness and pain, while deeper burns can lead to blistering, skin necrosis, and even systemic symptoms such as shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of burn injuries can vary widely, depending on factors such as the severity and extent of the burn, the patient's overall health, and the presence of complications. Burns involving a large percentage of the body surface area or those that result in inhalation injury can have a poor prognosis.

Chemical cold packs and ice packs — Limited studies show no benefit in heat reduction with traditional placement of ice or chemical cold packs over major vessels; ice packs have greater cooling capacity than chemical cold packs and, if used, are most efficacious when wet and covering the entire body; in a small translational study, chemical cold packs applied to the palms, soles, and cheeks showed twice the cooling rate compared to traditional major-vessel placements; Recommendations: If ice packs are used, we recommend applying them to cover the entire body (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If too few ice packs are available to cover the entire body, we recommend they be applied to the cheeks, palms, and soles rather than the skin covering the major vessels (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^1112F3xs]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Exertional heat illness (EHI) — field cooling priorities and modalities emphasize immediate action and water-based cooling. Guidance states to initiate immediate cooling measures, and that body cooling should take priority if a rectal temperature cannot be measured immediately; aggressive cooling should be started within minutes of collapse. The thermal rationale notes, "The thermal conductivity of water is up to 32 times that of air", and that ice water tub immersion is effective for whole body cooling in hot, humid conditions and is the preferred method of cooling in all conditions when available. Field experience includes, "At the Falmouth Road Race (11.4 km), 274 consecutive runners (ages 11 to 70 years old)" cooled on-site with no fatalities and limited hospitalizations. When tubs are impractical, "the use of 190-L (50-gallon) tubs with 10 to 15 kg (20 to 30 lbs) of ice may be impractical, and more portable methods may be an acceptable alternative to initiate body cooling", with commonly used options such as rotating ice water soaked towels, applying ice packs in the neck, axilla, and groin, repeatedly dousing with ice water, or continuously spraying with cool tap water; however, "Ice packs over major blood vessels in the groin, axilla, and neck… is not recommended as a lone treatment modality". Additionally, "All athletic venues that anticipate any chance of EHS should provide resources and expertise to facilitate whole body cooling".

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) epidemiology — NFCIs can occur when extremities are subjected to cold, often wet, conditions that overwhelm their capacity to maintain warmth, leading to peripheral cooling. They usually occur only after continuous exposure to cold for at least 1 to 3 d, although they have been reported after immersion in cold sea water at 0 to 8°C (32–46°F) for 14 to 22 h. Some authors have suggested, based on anecdotes, that an NFCI can occur in as short a time as 1 h.

Cryotherapy following shoulder arthroplasty — glenohumeral osteoarthritis: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that either continuous cryotherapy or cold packs can be used following shoulder arthroplasty. Stated grading is "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus" and "Strength of Evidence (evidence quality): No reliable evidence". Cited evidence includes one randomized control trial comparing continuous cryotherapy versus ice pack in 40 patients that did not demonstrate a significant difference in pain scores, quality of sleep or narcotic use, and the study included both anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty and was not exclusive to patients who received shoulder arthroplasty for glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Uncommon potential harm entails prolonged ice pack exposure leading to skin burn. Cold therapy units may not be covered by insurance and may add cost to the patient. It is feasible for patients to manage post-operative swelling with cold therapy units or ice packs. More high-quality evidence is needed focusing on the effectiveness of cold therapy units in patients who receive anatomic shoulder arthroplasty for osteoarthritis.

Rapid rewarming is optimal when further cold exposure can be avoided reliably. Repetitive freeze-thaw cycles are associated with increased morbidity and tissue loss caused by progressive microvascular injury and thrombosis. The subsequent care is largely supportive and consists of wound care and physical and hydrotherapy to promote optimal functional recovery.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for frostbite, more specifically with respect to active rewarming, WMS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate field rewarming as follows only if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care:

- perform field rewarming by warm water bath immersion if the proper resources are available and definitive care is > 2 hours distant; avoid using other heat sources (such as fire, space heater, oven, heated rocks) because of the risk of thermal burn injury

- heat the water to 37–39 °C (98.6–102.2 °F) using a thermometer to maintain this range; determine a safe water temperature, if a thermometer is not available, by placing a caregiver's uninjured hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to confirm that the water temperature is tolerable and will not cause burn injury

- consider circulating water around the frozen tissue to help maintain correct temperature

- rewarm and replace the water regularly while taking care not to burn the immersed skin, as the water may cool after once the frostbitten tissue is immersed; use a healthy hand to measure water temperature, if a thermometer is not available, by fully immersing long enough to experience a very warm but tolerable sensation

- ensure that the immersed tissue does not touch the container itself

- stir the water and monitor its temperature continually with a thermometer or healthy hand

- complete rewarming when the involved part takes on a red or purple appearance and becomes soft and pliable to the touch, a process usually accomplished in approximately 30 minutes, but varying depending on the extent and depth of injury

- allow the affected tissues to air dry or gently dry with a blotting technique (not rubbing) to minimize further damage.

### Interventions for frostbite injuries [^117M2rer]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Frostbite is a thermal injury caused when tissue is exposed to sub-zero temperatures (in degrees Celsius) long enough for ice crystals to form in the affected tissue. Depending on the degree of tissue damage, thrombosis, ischaemia, necrosis (tissue death), gangrene and ultimately amputation may occur. Several interventions for frostbite injuries have been proposed, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, sympathectomy (nerve block), thrombolytic (blood-thinning) therapy and vasodilating agents such as iloprost, reserpine, pentoxifylline and buflomedil, but the benefits and harms of these interventions are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the different management options for frostbite injuries.

Search Methods

On 25 February 2020, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), as well as trials registers. Shortly before publication, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, OpenGrey and GreyLit (9 November 2020) again. We investigated references from relevant articles, and corresponded with a trial author.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any medical intervention, e.g. pharmacological therapy, topical treatments or rewarming techniques, for frostbite injuries to another treatment, placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. We used Review Manager 5 for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess bias in the included trial. We assessed incidence of amputations, rates of serious and non-serious adverse events, acute pain, chronic pain, ability to perform activities of daily living, quality of life, withdrawal rate from medical therapy due to adverse events, occupational effects and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included one, open-label randomised trial involving 47 participants with severe frostbite injuries. We judged this trial to be at high risk of bias for performance bias, and uncertain risk for attrition bias; all other risk of bias domains we judged as low. All participants underwent rapid rewarming, received 250 mg of aspirin and 400 mg intravascular (IV) buflomedil (since withdrawn from practice), and were then randomised to one of three treatment groups for the following eight days. Group 1 received additional IV buflomedil 400 mg for one hour per day. Group 2 received the prostacyclin, iloprost, 0.5 ng to 2 ng/kg/min IV for six hours per day. Group 3 received IV iloprost 2 ng/kg/min for six hours per day plus fibrinolysis with 100 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for the first day only. The results suggest that iloprost and iloprost plus rtPA may reduce the rate of amputations in people with severe frostbite compared to buflomedil alone, RR 0.05 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.78; P = 0.03; very low-quality evidence) and RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.94; P = 0.04; very low-quality evidence), respectively. Iloprost may be as effective as iloprost plus rtPA at reducing the amputation rate, RR 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.56; P = 0.19; very low-quality evidence). There were no reported deaths or withdrawals due to adverse events in any of the groups; we assessed evidence for both outcomes as being of very low quality. Adverse events (including flushing, nausea, palpitations and vomiting) were common, but not reported separately by comparator arm (very low-quality evidence). The included study did not measure the outcomes of acute pain, chronic pain, ability to perform activities of daily living, quality of life or occupational effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of evidence regarding interventions for frostbite injuries. Very low-quality evidence from a single small trial indicates that iloprost, and iloprost plus rtPA, in combination with buflomedil may reduce the need for amputation in people with severe frostbite compared to buflomedil alone. However, buflomedil has been withdrawn from use. High quality randomised trials are needed to establish firm evidence for the treatment of frostbite injuries.

### Ice burn: protecting the flank during renal cryotherapy [^111m6PFB]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Cryoablation is a viable minimally invasive strategy for the treatment of small renal masses. One of the most common postoperative complaints is pain or paresthesia at the cryoprobe insertion site. The use of a 14-gauge angiocatheter to insulate the flank during renal cryotherapy was investigated.

Materials and Methods

Six Yorkshire swine underwent laparoscopy-guided percutaneous cryoablation of the upper and lower poles of both kidneys with a 1.47 mm (17 gauge) cryoneedle. Treatment consisted of a double 10-minute freeze separated by a 5-minute active thaw. Trials were randomized to placement of the cryoneedle directly through the flank or through a 14-gauge angiocatheter as an insulating sheath. Temperatures were recorded adjacent to the cryoneedle at two depths in the flank with a Multi-Point Thermal Sensor.

Results

Twelve trials were completed each with a bare and sheathed cryoneedle. The coldest temperature observed was -26 degrees C for the bare cryoneedle and -21 degrees C for the sheathed cryoneedle. At the outer sensor, there was a 4.1 degrees C increase in mean temperature for freeze 1, and 6.2 degrees C increase in mean temperature for freeze 2 with sheath use. At the inner sensor, there was a 3.0 degrees C increase in mean temperature for freeze 1, and 9.4 degrees C increase in mean temperature for freeze 2 with sheath use. There was a trend toward statistical significance of sheath insulation at the outer (p = 0.07) and inner (p = 0.08) temperature sensors.

Conclusions

A 14-gauge angiocatheter may provide some insulation and thereby might help protect against "ice burn" during renal cryotherapy.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^117PeGvZ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Thermal burn symptom relief and wound coverage after cooling — analgesics, topical agents, and dressings: It is reasonable to give over-the-counter pain medications for pain from thermal burns; over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs are well tolerated and generally recommended for burn pain, and a prospective study enrolling 61 patients with second- or third-degree burns randomly assigned to either receive 800 mg IV ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours found no significant incidence in serious adverse events. After cooling, for small partial-thickness burns being managed at home, it may be reasonable to apply petrolatum, petrolatum-based antibiotic ointment, honey, or aloe vera and a clean nonadherent dressing to open burn wounds, and while awaiting evaluation by a health care professional, it may be reasonable to loosely cover a burn that has intact skin or an intact blister with a clean cloth or nonadherent dry dressing. Supportive evidence notes that petrolatum (with or without topical antibiotics such as polymyxin), honey, and aloe have been shown to improve healing time in patients with partial-thickness, "open" burns, and specialized burn dressings are assumed not to be available in the first aid setting.

### Environmental cold-induced injury [^113c4yqs]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

More than 650 deaths from hypothermia occur each year in the United States. Even minor deviation from normal temperature leads to important symptoms and disability. The most significant risk factors are advanced age, mental impairment, substance abuse, and injury. This article examines the incidence of hypothermia, its detrimental effect on trauma patients, and methods of rewarming the hypothermic patient. It also looks at the controversial protective role hypothermia might play in shock, organ transplantation, cardiac arrest, and brain injury. Finally, it examines cold injuries, including frostbite, chilblain, and trench foot, and makes recommendations for their treatment.

Severe frostbite — guideline methods and key PICO questions: For the creation of this guideline, the committee met virtually and communicated electronically, identified clinically important questions on the "treatment of severe frostbite injury", and designed questions using a PICO approach. Key questions include whether rapid rewarming in a 38 to 42°C water bath compared with not using rapid rewarming reduces amputations or allows a more distal level of amputation, and whether use of vascular imaging studies compared with not using them affects the use or timing of thrombolytic therapy.

### Prevention and treatment of nonfreezing cold injuries and warm water immersion tissue injuries: a supplement to the Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines [^112eWYFs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of nonfreezing cold injuries (NFCIs; trench foot and immersion foot) and warm water immersion injuries (warm water immersion foot and tropical immersion foot) in prehospital and hospital settings. The panel graded the recommendations based on the quality of supporting evidence and the balance between benefits and risks/burdens according to the criteria published by the American College of Chest Physicians. Treatment is more difficult with NFCIs than with warm water immersion injuries. In contrast to warm water immersion injuries that usually resolve without sequelae, NFCIs may cause prolonged debilitating symptoms, including neuropathic pain and cold sensitivity.

### Full-thickness skin burn caused by radiofrequency ablation of a benign thyroid nodule [^115g7Bx2]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a full-thickness skin burn caused by RFA of a benign thyroid nodule. The RFA-induced skin burns that have been reported so far were usually of first degree, and patients recovered within seven days. Here, we describe this clinical experience to raise awareness that RFA can also lead — although rarely — to full-thickness burns that take at least three weeks to heal and usually develop a scar, which may be severe. Patients should be informed of this extremely infrequent but regrettable possibility as well as its remedies, especially if they are undergoing RFA because of cosmetic concerns (and they want to avoid surgical scars).

In order to prevent such a complication, it is important to keep the active needle tip within the nodule. To do so, it is recommended to use the transisthmic approach whenever possible. It can also be useful to inject cold fluid in the subcutaneous layers under the puncture site in order to create a wheal that will raise the skin and increase the distance from the nodule (we generally do that when injecting the lidocaine). It is also suggested to apply an ice bag on the skin next to the puncture site during the ablation. In any case, it is important to keep in mind that conscious sedation may delay the detection of complications, and it is important to pay attention when treating superficial nodules in lean patients, where the active needle tip is more likely to come into contact with the skin. In cases when a skin burn develops, specific care will facilitate the wound healing process in order to achieve a satisfactory esthetic result.

### State of the art in burn treatment [^114ppyGL]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment of burn victims requires deep understanding of the profound pathophysiological changes occurring locally and systemically after injury. Accurate estimation of burn size and depth, as well as early resuscitation, is essential. Good burn care includes also cleansing, debridement, and prevention of sepsis. Wound healing, is of major importance to the survival and clinical outcome of burn patients. An ideal therapy would not only promote rapid healing but would also act as an antiscarring therapy. The present article is a literature review of the most up-to-date modalities applied to burn treatment without overlooking the numerous controversies that still persist.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) — differential diagnosis with frostbite is distinguished by exposure and tissue characteristics: Frostbite, unlike NFCI, occurs only at air temperatures well below freezing and cannot occur in cold water, even sea water. Frostbite that is still frozen appears pale blue, yellow, or white, and unlike tissue with NFCI, frostbitten tissue that has not been thawed is firm or hard and looks waxy.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines for the treatment of heat stroke [^115UCPf9]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Predicted increases in heat-related weather phenomena will result in increasing heat exposures and heat injuries, like heat stroke. Prompt recognition, early intervention, and evidence-based management are necessary to optimize outcomes.

Objectives

The objective of these guidelines was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with heat stroke.

Design

The Society of Critical Care Medicine convened a multidisciplinary panel of 18 international clinicians, comprising expertise in critical care, emergency medicine, neurocritical care, surgery, trauma/burn surgery, sports medicine, athletic training, military medicine, nursing, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, and one patient representative. The panel also included a guidelines methodologist specialized in developing evidence-based recommendations in alignment with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Conflict-of-interest policies were strictly followed during all phases of guidelines development including panel selection and voting.

Methods

The panel members identified Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes questions in two main areas: cooling modalities and medications that affect temperature. A systematic review for each question was conducted to identify the best available evidence, statistically analyze the evidence, and assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. The GRADE evidence-to-decision framework was used to formulate the recommendations. Good practice statements were included to provide additional clinical guidance.

Results

The panel generated two strong recommendations, five good practice statements and one "only-in-the-context of research" statement. Active cooling measures are recommended over passive cooling methods, with cold- or ice-water immersion achieving the fastest cooling rate. This method should be prioritized where available. In heat stroke patients, there is no evidence to support pharmacological interventions that affect temperature control and they should be avoided.

Conclusions

The guidelines task force provided recommendations for the management of patients with heat stroke. These recommendations should be considered along with the patient's clinical status and available resources.

Post-thaw severity assessment — Hennepin score and Cauchy classification notes that severity of frostbite may vary within a single extremity and, once thawing occurs and a patient reaches a field clinic or hospital, frostbite can be further classified via 2 additional methods; the Hennepin score uses a system similar to measuring burns by total body surface area and the effect of treatment can then be quantified retrospectively, while the Cauchy classification measures anatomical extent using grades 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as specified and, although not validated, grades correlate well with bone scans and clinical outcomes, may assist caregivers in predicting tissue loss and amputation risk, and higher grades designate more proximal injuries with greater risk for functionally important amputation, with an example where a necrotic fingertip labeled grade 4 by the 4-tiered system would be designated grade 1 on the Cauchy method.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: management of paediatric minor burns [^116pbbzJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Burn injuries are a common presentation to the paediatric emergency department (PED) and are painful, distressing and may have long-term sequelae. In adhering to the first aid principles of burns management, we aim to alleviate pain, prevent bacterial contamination and minimise the extent of injury. First aid involves cooling the burn and covering with an appropriate material while simultaneously providing analgesia. Assessing the severity (depth and total body surface area) of the burn are important for prognostication with implications for management. It is imperative to consider non-accidental injury in burns, which be present in 10% of cases.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1159vuTw]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Sprains and strains — supportive guidance notes that the mainstay of treatment is rest and limiting the use of the injured extremity. Cold application can acutely decrease pain and swelling in joint sprains and muscle strains; in an RCT of 74 patients with sports-related soft tissue injury, cold therapy to soft tissue injuries improved pain scores at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after injury, and cold therapy improved edema compared with heat therapy in the acute time period, although cold application has not been demonstrated to improve function or time to recovery. The greatest tissue cooling is achieved by using a bag filled with ice and water surrounded by a damp cloth; other modalities such as refreezable gel packs or ice alone can also be used but do not cool the area as effectively as an ice and water mixture; experts recommend limiting the duration of cold application to 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 times daily, and to prevent cold injury, ice should not be placed directly on the skin.

### Toxic cutaneous responses from inhalant abuse [^114D89e8]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inhalant abuse is the intentional inhalation of volatile substances to achieve intoxication. Inhaled substances include cheap, easily accessible, legal, everyday products, and abuse is most common in adolescence. There is considerable morbidity and mortality associated with this underdetected form of substance abuse, such as cryogenic burns. These cryogenic burns may be easily overlooked by clinicians, especially in areas where exposure to freezing temperatures is uncommon. As the prevalence of inhalant abuse steadily increases because of its wide availability, more cryogenic burn cases will likely present to clinicians.

### Cooling of the burn wound: the ideal temperature of the coolant [^116n1MtX]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The beneficial effects of cooling a fresh burn wound were well demonstrated. However, there are still conflicting reports as to the optimum temperature of coolant, duration of application and effects in limiting tissue damage. A study was undertaken to investigate this, the importance of the temperature of, and the time period of application of the coolant.

Materials and Methods

Four identical deep dermal wounds were created on the back of 10 anaesthetised pigs. Each animal served as an independent experimental model. The effectiveness of cooling was monitored by measuring intradermal temperatures. The animals were divided into two groups; using ice water and tap water as the coolants. In each pig one wound was not cooled (wound 1). Three were cooled; one immediately for 30 min in group 1 and for 4 h in group 2 (wound 2). The other two wounds were cooled after 30 min for 30 min and 3 h (wounds 3 and 4, respectively).

Results

It was found that the temperature of the coolant was crucial. When ice water of 1–8 degrees C (group 1) was used more necrosis than in the wounds that were not cooled was seen. When tap water was used at 12–18 degrees C (group 2) it was demonstrated clinically and histologically that the cooled wounds had less necrosis than the uncooled wounds and thus healed faster. In group 2 the beneficial effects of cooling were still present when delayed for half an hour.

Conclusion

First aid cooling of a burn wound with tap water is an effective method of minimising the damage sustained during a burn, and is universally and immediately available. Ice water cooling is associated with an increase in tissue damage.

JAMA. 1960; 173: 1916–1919. doi: 10.1001/jama.1960.03020350034007 Patients with burns of all degrees involving less than 20% of the body surface were treated by immersion of the burned areas in baths of ice water or by applying ice-cold compresses as promptly as possible. In each of 150 cases, pain was immediately relieved and the extent of the redness and blistering visibly reduced. Local cooling was continued for several hours, until pain no longer returned when the part was taken out of the bath. No infections occurred in patients treated within one hour after the burn. This form of treatment has advantages in emergency care for lesser burns, since it is easily available, inexpensive, humane, and promptly effective.

### Sulfur trioxide&sulfuric acid | ToxFAQs ™ | ATSDR… [^11367HF8]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Sulfur trioxide is formed from sulfur dioxide; SO₃ forms sulfuric acid when it comes in contact with water. Sulfuric acid can cause burns to the skin, eyes, lungs, and digestive tract. Severe exposure can result in death. This substance has been found in at least 47 of the 1, 467. National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Sulfur trioxide is generally a colorless liquid. It can also exist as ice- or fiber-like crystals or as a gas. When SO₃ is exposed to air, it rapidly takes up water and gives off white fumes. It can react with water to form sulfuric acid. manufacture of fertilizers, explosives, other acids, and glue; in the purifiction of petroleum; in the pickling of metal; and in lead-acid batteries. Touching sulfuric acid will burn your skin, and breathing sulfuric acid can result in tooth erosion and respiratory tract irritation.

Drinking sulfuric acid can burn your mouth, throat, and stomach; it can result in death. If you get sulfuric acid in your eyes, it will cause your eyes to water and will burn. People who have breathed large quantities of sulfuric acid at work have shown an increase in cancers of the larynx. However, most of the people were also smokers who were exposed to other chemcals and acids as well. The ability of sulfuric acid to cause cancer in laboratory animals has not been studied. The International. Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that occupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic to humans. IARC has not classified pure sulfuric acid for its carcinogenic effects. Children may be exposed in the same ways as adults; however, they may be more at risk due to accidental. injuries and accidents in the home. Teenagers may have jobs in which they have contact with sulfuric acid.

Children may have increased sensitivity to sulfuric acid in air, due to their smaller airway diameters and the fact that they breathe more air per kilogram of body. ATSDR can also tell you the location of occupational and environmental health clinics. These clinics specialize in recognizing, evaluating, and treating illnesses resulting from exposure to hazardous substances.
