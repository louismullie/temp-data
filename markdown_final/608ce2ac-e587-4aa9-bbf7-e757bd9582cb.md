## Question

What are the benefits of using benzodiazepines in the initial treatment of GAD in elderly patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether benzodiazepines have any benefits in the initial treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in older adults, and under what circumstances, if any, they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines say about benzodiazepines as first-line therapy for GAD in general and in older adults. Then, I should verify the specific risks in older adults, including falls, cognition, and interactions. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale and any short-term benefits that could justify a limited role. After that, I need to check whether any high-credibility sources carve out exceptions for acute, severe anxiety or bridging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated approach and state a clear conclusion with monitoring and tapering considerations.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance so I don't jump to conclusions. The WHO 2023 mhGAP recommends not using benzodiazepines for adult GAD, and the AAFP 2022 guideline advises against benzodiazepines as first-line therapy for anxiety disorders, which sets a strong default against routine use in older adults as well [^1143rQTx] [^113HGjNg]. I should also confirm geriatric-specific guidance: the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria advises avoiding benzodiazepines in adults over 65 due to increased risks of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle accidents, reinforcing that they are not appropriate first-line in older adults [^112Jkbhm] [^1178XPmj].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of harm in older adults so I can weigh risks accurately. Meta-analytic data show that in adults over 60, benzodiazepines are associated with a 3.8-fold increase in daytime sedation, a 4.8-fold increase in cognitive impairment, and a 2.6-fold increase in psychomotor effects, with a 34% higher risk of hip fracture, and these risks persist or increase with chronic use even as therapeutic effects wane [^112cii8Q] [^116VnKZm]. I should double-check real-world signals too: population data show higher accident-related medical events with benzodiazepines, and co-prescribing with antidepressants in late-life anxiety is associated with more adverse effects and lower antidepressant dosing, suggesting a more fragile clinical course [^113T6T37] [^112NGdSo].

> Hold on, let's not dismiss pharmacologic plausibility without checking it. Benzodiazepines do provide rapid anxiolysis via GABA-A modulation, which can be clinically meaningful in acute presentations, but I need to ensure I don't overstate this as a treatment advantage in older adults given the risk profile and lack of long-term benefit [^115VwRSw]. I should confirm that any short-term benefit is precisely what emergency guidance targets, not routine initial care for GAD in older adults [^114DmtnY].

> Next, I should review whether any high-credibility sources allow exceptions. The WHO allows consideration of short-term benzodiazepines for 3–7 days in emergency management of acute and severe anxiety symptoms, which is not the same as initial treatment of chronic GAD in older adults, so I need to be careful not to conflate these scenarios [^114DmtnY]. The British Association for Psychopharmacology suggests considering benzodiazepines only short-term or when other treatments fail, again not as first-line for GAD in older adults, and the Canadian Geriatrics Society recommends reserving benzodiazepine receptor agonists for short-term bridging after failure of safer options, which aligns with a very limited, time-limited role rather than initial therapy [^115RJPNj] [^112YuUCA] [^1124NSMU].

> Let me consider the clinical scenarios where benefits might outweigh risks, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating them. In rare cases of severe, treatment-resistant GAD where multiple safer pharmacotherapies and psychotherapy have failed, long-term benzodiazepines may be considered, but that is not the initial treatment question and certainly not the typical older adult starting care pathway [^112cii8Q]. For initial care, the only defensible role is ultra-short-term bridging for acute distress while initiating evidence-based therapy, and even then, I need to ensure the lowest effective dose, avoid long-acting agents, and plan a prompt taper to mitigate dependence and falls [^114DmtnY] [^1124NSMU].

> I will now examine safer first-line alternatives so I can provide a complete, practical recommendation. SSRIs and SNRIs have robust efficacy for GAD with high-certainty evidence, and venlafaxine ER has specific data showing similar efficacy and tolerability in older adults compared with younger adults, supporting antidepressants as preferred initial pharmacotherapy in late-life GAD [^116UGNsP] [^114U3ZVA]. Buspirone is a reasonable non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and pregabalin can be considered when rapid anxiolysis is needed, though somnolence and dizziness warrant caution in older adults; CBT remains effective across ages and should be offered early, particularly given its favorable risk profile compared with benzodiazepines [^114F8Yie] [^115L3R4j] [^115Xjo3o].

> But wait, what if someone argues that benzodiazepines outperform antidepressants on somatic anxiety symptoms and therefore might be justified initially? A recent meta-analysis suggests benzodiazepines may reduce somatic symptoms more than antidepressants in the short term, yet this potential advantage must be weighed against the markedly higher risks in older adults and the lack of long-term benefit, so it does not overturn the recommendation to avoid benzodiazepines as initial therapy in this population [^111B4hgE] [^112cii8Q].

> I should confirm practical safeguards if, despite all of this, a brief benzodiazepine is used as a bridge in an older adult with acute severe anxiety. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, prefer a shorter half-life agent to limit accumulation, avoid concurrent CNS depressants, and schedule close follow-up to taper within 1–2 weeks; concurrently initiate and titrate an SSRI or SNRI and/or CBT so the benzodiazepine can be withdrawn promptly, consistent with emergency-use guidance and geriatric safety principles [^114DmtnY] [^1124NSMU] [^115Xjo3o].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a contradictory guideline. The balance of evidence and guidance is clear: there are no benefits of benzodiazepines as initial treatment for GAD in older adults that outweigh their substantial risks; the only narrowly acceptable role is ultra-short-term emergency management of acute severe anxiety while definitive therapy is initiated, and even that requires explicit risk mitigation and a predetermined exit plan [^1143rQTx] [^113HGjNg] [^1178XPmj] [^114DmtnY].

> Final clinical position: I should state this plainly and then verify alignment with the cited sources. Benzodiazepines should not be used as initial treatment for GAD in older adults due to increased risks of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, sedation, and dependence; instead, initiate SSRIs or SNRIs and/or CBT, consider buspirone or pregabalin when appropriate, and reserve benzodiazepines for rare, short-term emergency use with a planned taper and concurrent initiation of evidence-based long-term treatment [^115AR1bU] [^116UGNsP] [^115Xjo3o] [^114DmtnY].

---

Benzodiazepines are **not recommended as first-line therapy** for GAD in older adults due to significant risks, including falls, cognitive impairment, and dependence [^113HGjNg] [^1143rQTx] [^1178XPmj]. They may be considered only for **short-term use (≤ 4 weeks)** [^111zCC1X] in severe, refractory cases or as a bridge while initiating safer therapies, with careful monitoring and a planned taper [^1124NSMU] [^112cii8Q]. Safer alternatives include SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, and CBT, which are preferred for initial management in elderly patients [^116UGNsP] [^115Xjo3o].

---

## Clinical benefits of benzodiazepines in elderly GAD patients

Benzodiazepines provide **rapid anxiolysis** — within hours — which is useful for acute distress or as a bridge until slower-onset therapies take effect [^1124NSMU]. They also reduce somatic symptoms (e.g. muscle tension, restlessness) and improve short-term function and quality of life, which can be valuable during acute episodes [^111B4hgE].

---

## Risks and adverse effects in elderly patients

Elderly patients face **heightened risks** with benzodiazepines, including:

- **Falls and fractures**: Increased risk of falls, hip fractures, and hospitalizations [^112cii8Q] [^115AR1bU].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Higher rates of delirium, memory impairment, and confusion [^112cii8Q] [^111zCC1X].
- **Dependence and withdrawal**: Physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, including rebound anxiety and seizures [^111ZBJTc] [^114bTsdh].
- **Motor vehicle accidents**: Higher risk of crashes and related injuries [^112Jkbhm] [^115AR1bU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines **advise against routine benzodiazepine use** in elderly GAD patients:

- **First-line therapy**: SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, and CBT are preferred [^notfound].
- **Short-term use**: If used, limit to ≤ 4 weeks with close monitoring and a planned taper [^116VnKZm] [^115hdkrZ].
- **Avoidance**: Avoid in patients with substance use disorders, cognitive impairment, or high fall risk [^116VnKZm] [^1178XPmj].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Safer pharmacologic options include **SSRIs/SNRIs** (effective for GAD with a favorable long-term safety profile) [^115VwRSw] and **buspirone** (non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic effective for GAD with fewer sedative and cognitive effects) [^114F8Yie]. Pregabalin is effective for somatic symptoms but requires caution due to sedation and dizziness [^115L3R4j].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacologic care is **strongly recommended**, particularly CBT, which reduces anxiety symptoms and improves function in older adults [^115Xjo3o]. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques also reduce anxiety and stress, and sleep hygiene strategies improve sleep and reduce anxiety-related distress.

---

## Clinical scenarios for benzodiazepine use

Benzodiazepines may be appropriate only in **specific scenarios**:

- **Severe, refractory GAD**: Short-term use when other treatments fail or are contraindicated [^115RJPNj] [^112YuUCA].
- **Acute distress**: Short-term bridge while initiating SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT [^1124NSMU] [^114DmtnY].
- **Palliative care**: For severe anxiety in end-of-life settings [^116VnKZm].

---

## Monitoring and discontinuation strategies

If benzodiazepines are prescribed, **careful monitoring and tapering** are essential:

- **Regular monitoring**: Track for sedation, cognitive effects, falls, and misuse [^117Jxcqf].
- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce by 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; avoid abrupt discontinuation [^111wCmGW] [^113vUkGX].
- **Adjunctive support**: Use CBT or other behavioral interventions during taper [^1165kp3i] [^111uVNG8].

---

Benzodiazepines are **not first-line** for GAD in older adults due to substantial risks; reserve for short-term use in severe or refractory cases with close monitoring and a planned taper, while prioritizing safer pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies [^113HGjNg] [^1143rQTx].

### First-line pharmacotherapy approaches for generalized anxiety disorder [^112HSjqf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) do not receive adequate treatment. Several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, azapirones, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, alpha(2)delta Ca++ channel modulators, and atypical antipsychotics are consistently beneficial in patients with GAD. Cognitive therapy is also effective as a first-line treatment. When individualizing treatment, drug dose ranges and side effect profiles need to be considered, as well as the patient's comorbid conditions. Doses may need to be reduced for elderly or medically ill patients or those taking other medications. Doses may need to be increased for refractory cases. Common comorbid conditions with GAD include depression, alcohol or drug abuse, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. In patients with significant depression, an antidepressant is more likely to succeed than a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. Remission is attainable but can take several months, and stopping medication increases the risk of relapse within the first year of initiating treatment.

### Magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^116fknCw]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

As people age, their ability to metabolize drugs decreases, and receptor sensitivity to the effects of pharmacotherapy changes. Unfortunately, older adults are often underrepresented in randomized controlled trials, an important source of information for prescribers. Consequently, physicians may sometimes prescribe therapies on presumptions of efficacy and safety based on clinical trial results that are not necessarily generalizable to persons of advanced age. This may explain why we found that so many patients with GAD received medications that were potentially inappropriate. Inappropriate prescribing also may result from the use of inappropriate doses of otherwise age-appropriate medications and/or not prescribing medications that may be of benefit (e.g. not prescribing GAD-related therapies for patients with this condition). Accordingly, our findings probably underestimate the magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with GAD. Further study is needed to ascertain the extent to which these other aspects of potentially inappropriate prescribing are evident in this patient population.

The clinical implication of our findings appears to be that benzodiazepines, amitriptyline, and doxepin are being overprescribed in Germany among elderly patients with GAD, especially among those with comorbid depression and/or sleep disorders. A major limitation of our study, however, is that we cannot assess the actual extent to which prescribing was truly clinically inappropriate. The treatment of GAD in the elderly is clinically complex and presents many challenges. Since we did not employ a "therapeutic timeline" as part of our research design, patients could have received potentially inappropriate agents either as initial treatment or following failure of safer, more appropriate agents. To the extent that the latter occurred, providers may have known about the risks associated with these medications and nonetheless used them only after a careful balancing of these risks against their potential benefits in patients with severe symptoms. Further study is needed to clarify the extent of truly clinically inappropriate prescribing.

### Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^115L3R4j]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Data Sources

A search of PubMed (1966-December 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 2011) was conducted using the MeSH and free-text terms pregabalin, anxiety disorders, and anxiety.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified through the search were evaluated for inclusion. Only randomized controlled trials involving the use of pregabalin for the treatment of GAD were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Eight published trials were identified through the search strategy. Successful treatment of GAD with pregabalin versus placebo and active comparators has been reported in clinical trials. Pregabalin lowered total Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores within 1 week and was effective against both somatic and psychic subcomponents. In 1 controlled clinical trial, pregabalin was found to be effective in patients aged 65 years and older. Another trial demonstrated improved relapse rates when pregabalin, compared with placebo, was used for up to 6 months. The most commonly experienced adverse events were somnolence, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that pregabalin is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of GAD. As somnolence and dizziness are common adverse effects, caution should be used in elderly patients. Pregabalin rapidly relieves anxiety, a benefit that it may have over many other currently available therapeutic options besides benzodiazepines. While not a first-line therapy in GAD, pregabalin offers another treatment option in patients who do not respond to or who suffer intolerable adverse effects from other agents.

### Debate: are benzodiazepines appropriate treatments for patients with substance use disorders? Yes [^1131ASMs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are a controversial treatment for anxiety in patients with substance use disorders. Concerns include risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion. But benzodiazepines are among the most effective and well-tolerated treatments for anxiety, and are safe for the majority of patients who take them. Though not appropriate for all cases, particularly in those with an active opioid use disorder, benzodiazepines should be considered as a treatment for patients with substance use disorders after careful weighing of benefits and harms.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113XGstc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk factors for severe withdrawal and implications for taper pace — "The development of more severe BZD withdrawal symptoms is associated with use of BZDs with a shorter half-life and fewer active metabolites (e.g., alprazolam), daily use, higher total daily dose, longer duration of use, and history of severe withdrawal". Accordingly, "A slower initial pace of BZD tapering is likely to be safer and more effective for patients who have a high likelihood of physical dependence and significant risk of withdrawal", and "patients should be involved in determining the initial and ongoing tapering pace with clinicians, with the pace ideally agreed upon in a shared decision-making process". The guideline also notes that psychiatric comorbidity complicates tapering: "The presence of certain psychiatric symptoms has been associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms", with examples including "higher levels of anxiety" and personality disorder traits that "often experience considerable difficulty discontinuing BZDs".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116VnKZm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks. This guidance reflects the general lack of evidence for the long-term clinical benefit of BZDs, as well as research demonstrating that the clinical benefits may decrease over time while the risks persist. – Meta-analyses of patients taking BZDs for insomnia demonstrated minor improvements in sleep onset, increased sleep duration, and decreased nighttime awakenings. However, therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks due to changes in BZD receptor density and/or affinity resulting from chronic use, while risks remain present. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BZDs to placebo for insomnia in adults over age 60 showed a 3.8-fold increase in daytime sedation, a 4.8-fold increase in cognitive impairment, and a 2.6 fold increase in incidence of psychomotor effects (e.g. falls, motor vehicle accidents). Another meta-analysis showed an increased risk of hip fractures (RR 1.34) associated with current and recent BZD use in older adults. In addition to its psychomotor effects, BZDs may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension in older adults, which also contributes to fall risks.

Although long-term BZD use should generally be avoided, exceptions do exist. For example, long-term BZD use may be indicated in patients with severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or bipolar spectrum disorders. – Long-term BZD use may also be appropriate for medical conditions such as complex seizure disorders, spasticity, sleep disorders involving abnormal movements (e.g. rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome), and catatonia. Finally, BZDs have a role in palliative and end-of-life care. In any of these patient populations, clinicians should consider consulting with an appropriate specialist to determine whether BZD tapering is indicated and manage the process when it is.

American Geriatrics Society — sedative-hypnotic use in older adults — advises: "Don't use benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium". Supporting rationale states "Large-scale studies consistently show that the risk of motor vehicle accidents, falls and hip fractures leading to hospitalization and death can more than double in older adults taking benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics". It adds that "Use of benzodiazepines should be reserved for alcohol withdrawal symptoms/delirium tremens or severe generalized anxiety disorder unresponsive to other therapies".

### Treating generalized anxiety disorder [^113raUJn]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronically persistent worry and therefore requires effective long-term treatment. This article reviews the benefits and risks associated with various pharmacologic and psychological therapies to assess their ability to achieve the elimination of GAD symptomatology and restoration of normal function. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as applied relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have all been shown to be effective when used as monotherapies and may be beneficial when used adjunctively. Current effective pharmacotherapies for patients with GAD include anxiolytic benzodiazepines, buspirone, and antidepressants including venlafaxine and paroxetine. Benzodiazepines have long been used to treat anxiety and are particularly appropriate in short-term treatment situations; however, their adverse side-effect profile and their inability to treat depression commonly comorbid with GAD renders them less than ideal in many situations. Buspirone has demonstrated anxiolytic benefits but, like benzodiazepines, shows negligible antidepressant action. Antidepressants like paroxetine and venlafaxine are not only effective antidepressants but also effective anxiolytics, thus implying their special ability to treat GAD and concurrent depression, even over the long-term.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115fJRCP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations
When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process.
When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent). Clinicians should elicit information from patients about their expectations and concerns about the tapering process and discuss them. Clinicians should discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) for which the BZD was initially prescribed that may be more effective and carry less risk compared to BZDs (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia).
The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should reassess risks and benefits throughout the tapering process to inform decision-making.
Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper. A short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal (e.g. due to the pharmacological properties of the BZD, patient age, comorbidities, other substance use, prior history of withdrawal) or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.
Many healthcare systems may not be able to manage the volume of patients who would benefit from BZD tapering. As such, clinicians and healthcare systems may need to triage patients, prioritizing those at higher risk of harm related to continued BZD use. See " Implementing this Guideline " for further discussion.

### Treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^115GmEqm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic worry that may persist for many years. It is a debilitating disorder, and effective long-term treatment is required. Psychotherapy, particularly relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, has shown long-term benefit in GAD and may be a useful approach alone and as an adjunct to pharmacotherapeutic options. Available medications for GAD include benzodiazepine anxiolytics, buspirone, and antidepressants. Although benzodiazepines are effective as short-term anxiolytics, their use is compromised by a poor adverse event profile and, like buspirone, they lack the antidepressant efficacy important for addressing the comorbid depression experienced by many patients with GAD. Antidepressants, including paroxetine and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, are effective anxiolytics and resolve symptoms of depression in patients with GAD. The benefit of venlafaxine is sustained long term, enabling increased numbers of patients to attain remission from symptoms and experience restoration of normal functioning. Although further clinical studies are required to establish the use of psychosocial therapy in the treatment of GAD. preliminary results are encouraging. At present, the use of psychosocial therapy and second-generation antidepressants, such as some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine, offer the best approach to attaining long-term benefit for patients with GAD.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112Jkbhm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

### The management of panic disorder [^114ijhDE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The evidence for benzodiazepines in panic disorder is compelling; along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are a standard treatment for panic and other anxiety disorders. However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^116xHLB8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, CGS 2020 guidelines recommend to avoid long-term use of BZRAs (> 4 weeks) in older adults, as these agents increase the risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and motor vehicle crashes. Offer alternative management strategies for insomnia, anxiety disorders, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ZBJTc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e. ≥ 120 days) is common. Long-term BZD use is associated with an increased risk of physical dependence and withdrawal and ongoing risk of adverse events such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive impairment.– Evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk, although the mechanism for this association is not well understood. The risk–benefit balance for continued BZD use may shift over time, and stopping can be challenging because physical dependence develops with regular use. It should be noted that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with the use of prescribed BZDs and is distinct from substance use disorders (SUDs; see Box 1). Older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use. Some older adults have taken BZDs continuously for decades. In some instances, use has been so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Box 1
Physical Dependence Versus Substance Use Disorder

Safe tapering of BZDs can be clinically complex because rapid dosage reductions may precipitate acute withdrawal, which can be life-threatening. Patients are also at risk of recurrence and exacerbation of the symptoms for which BZDs were initially prescribed (e.g. anxiety, seizures, insomnia) and destabilization. This Guideline was motivated, in part, by patients reporting harms associated with too rapid tapering/discontinuation of BZD medications. Inadequate tapering strategies may push patients to the illegal drug market, where counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSOs) are common, presenting an increased risk of overdose and overdose death. This Guideline aims to help clinicians in diverse practice settings determine whether and how to taper BZD medications.

Intersection with the Opioid Overdose Epidemic

Co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids. In addition, some individuals may concomitantly take BZDs and opioids to augment the effects of both substances.

Given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose. – In 2021, 13.7% of overdose deaths in the United States involving opioids also involved BZDs, and nearly 88% of overdose deaths involving BZDs also involved opioids.

### Clonazepam [^113zvo5E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Panic Disorder:

Adults:

The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.

Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.

There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Pediatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.

Geriatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam:

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

### Magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^116tgNN7]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Several medications commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been designated "potentially inappropriate" for use in patients aged ≥ 65 years because their risks may outweigh their potential benefits. The actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however.

Methods

Using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (GP) in Germany, we identified all patients, aged ≥ 65 years, with any GP office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of GAD (ICD-10 diagnosis code F41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 ("GAD patients"). Among GAD-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected TCAs, and hydroxyzine were designated "potentially inappropriate" for use in patients aged ≥ 65 years, based on published criteria.

Results

A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents – most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate.

Conclusion

GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD – especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with GAD for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks.

### Venlafaxine ER as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: pooled analysis of five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114U3ZVA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Concerns about the safety of benzodiazepines in older adults may have led investigators and clinicians to underestimate the importance of adequately treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in later life. To evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of an alternative treatment in older patients, we conducted a secondary analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of extended release venlafaxine (venlafaxine ER, Effexor XR) for adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of GAD.

Design

The five multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials used similar designs to evaluate short-term efficacy after 8 weeks. In addition, two studies evaluated efficacy and safety over 24 weeks under double-blind conditions.

Setting

Outpatients from both primary care and specialty mental healthcare settings were included. Three studies were conducted in the United States and two in Europe.

Participants

Intention-to-treat analyses included 1,839 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD and total scores of ≥ 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA). Ten percent of the patients were aged 60 and older and 5.0% were aged 65 and older.

Intervention

Fixed or flexible doses of venlafaxine ER in the dose range of 37.5 to 225 mg/day or matched placebo were used for 8 weeks in all studies and for 24 weeks in two studies.

Measurements

Primary efficacy variables included the HAMA total score and psychic anxiety factor, the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). Secondary efficacy variables included the HAMA somatic anxiety factor, the depression subscale of the HAD, CGI-3 severity, the Covi Scale for Anxiety, and the Raskin Scale for Depression.

Results

On the CGI, 66% of older patients (≥ 60 years) responded to venlafaxine ER, compared with 41% for placebo (P < .01 by logistic regression). For younger patients (< 60 years), comparable figures were 67% and 44%, respectively (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed no main effects for age and no age-by-treatment interactions for any of the primary or secondary efficacy outcome measures for either the 8- or 24-week analyses. Within the older adults subgroup, increasing age did not influence responses. In this cohort of GAD patients, higher levels of depression were associated with decreased responses of anxiety symptoms. In older adults, 23% of venlafaxine ER patients discontinued treatment prematurely versus 31% of those who received placebo; comparable figures for younger adult patients were 27% and 28%, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 15% versus 14% for venlafaxine ER and placebo, respectively, in older adults compared with 15% versus 8%, respectively, for younger adults.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine ER is equally safe and well tolerated by and shows similar efficacy in younger and older patients in the treatment of GAD.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of augmentation and switch strategies for refractory social anxiety disorder [^11268tMP]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Most patients remain symptomatic after an initial intervention with approved treatments for generalized social anxiety disorder. This randomized controlled trial provides systematic, prospectively derived data on the relative benefits of "next-step" pharmacotherapies to improve outcomes for individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder who remain symptomatic after initial treatment.

Method

This three site, 12-week, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the relative benefits of three strategies for patients remaining symptomatic (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale [LSAS] score > 50) after a 10-week trial of sertraline alone: the addition of up to 3.0 mg/day of clonazepam (sertraline plus clonazepam), a switch to up to 225 mg/day of venlafaxine, or prolonged sertraline treatment with placebo (sertraline plus placebo).

Results

A total of 397 participants received at least one dose of sertraline; 181 nonresponders (LSAS score > 50) at week 10 were randomly assigned to sertraline plus clonazepam, switch to venlafaxine, or sertraline plus placebo. Overall, 21% of patients achieved remission (LSAS score ≤ 30) at the endpoint, and 27% of patients assigned to sertraline plus clonazepam achieved remission compared with patients assigned to sertraline plus placebo (17%) or venlafaxine (19%), but the differences did not reach significance. Sertraline plus clonazepam was associated with a significantly greater drop in LSAS severity (p = 0.020) and disability (p = 0.0028) compared with sertraline plus placebo; no significant differences were observed on these parameters between venlafaxine and either sertraline plus placebo or sertraline plus clonazepam. In supplemental analysis, the overall response rate (LSAS score ≤ 50) was 46%, including a significantly greater proportion of patients in the sertraline plus clonazepam group (56%) compared with the sertraline plus placebo group responding (36%; p = 0.027); differences did not reach significance between venlafaxine and sertraline plus placebo or sertraline plus clonazepam.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that the clonazepam augmentation strategy provides relative benefits for sertraline nonresponders in social anxiety disorder.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yr6a2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk–benefit rationale and duration guidance: In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits, with risks including oversedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yqEjn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions. The CGC noted that distinguishing BZD withdrawal symptoms from recurrence of symptoms related to underlying conditions can be difficult. Based on clinical experience, symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage changes and/or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper are more likely to be related to BZD withdrawal. However, if symptoms do not resolve after pausing the taper, it may be unclear whether the symptoms are related to protracted withdrawal (which can last for months or years), worsening or new physical or mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety or sleep-related disorders), or a combination of withdrawal and underlying conditions. If the patient experiences physical or psychological symptoms that are distinct from symptoms of the underlying condition (e.g. neurological or sensory symptoms), they may be related to protracted withdrawal. In these instances, more frequent monitoring may be warranted. Clinicians may also consult with specialists appropriate to patients' symptoms.

Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal symptoms is lacking, treating symptoms of underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD; see Appendix 7 for a list of CPGs on the management of conditions for which BZDs are commonly prescribed). Clinicians should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment for any psychiatric disorder prior to or, if clinically indicated (e.g. due to imminent risks related to continued BZD use), concurrent with the taper. Clinicians should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible when selecting adjunctive medications (see Appendix 5).

### Antidepressants versus placebo for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^116UGNsP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterised by excessive anxiety and worry about everyday events. GAD is a common disorder and generally affects women twice as often as men. Treatments include various psychological and pharmacological therapies. Among the pharmacological therapies, antidepressants, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used for the treatment of GAD and many studies have shown their benefit over placebo. Only one systematic review and meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants to placebo has been done in the past. Since then, new data on existing antidepressants have emerged and new antidepressants have been introduced. An updated and more comprehensive review is needed to provide a stronger understanding of the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and impact on the quality of life of the various types of antidepressants compared to placebo.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antidepressants in GAD in adults, specifically: to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of GAD compared to placebo and to review the acceptability of antidepressants in GAD in terms of adverse effects, including the general prevalence of adverse effects compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Health Disorders (CCMD) register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cluster-RCTs that randomly assigned participants to receive either an antidepressant or placebo for the treatment of GAD. There were no restrictions on dose, frequency, intensity, or duration of treatment. The studies included adults of either sex with a primary diagnosis of GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Psychiatric comorbidities were allowed as long as GAD was the primary diagnosis. We excluded studies investigating psychotherapies and those that included participants who had regular use of benzodiazepines. There were no restrictions on setting, country, or language.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. A third review author resolved disagreements between the two primary review authors. We extracted study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures regarding efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 37 unique RCTs with 12,226 participants in the review. The studies included adults with moderate-severe GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Few studies included participants with secondary psychiatric comorbidities. The double-blind treatment duration ranged from four weeks to 28 weeks. Antidepressants have a benefit over placebo on rate of treatment response measured as a reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.55; 20 studies, 7267 participants; high-certainty evidence). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 5 to 9). Antidepressants have no difference in acceptability compared to placebo, measured as the number of participants who dropped out during the trial as a proportion of the total number of randomised participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 33 studies, 11,294 participants; high-certainty evidence). Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50; 29 studies, 11,007 participants; high-certainty evidence) with an NNTB of 27 (95% CI 24 to 32), and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.61; 32 studies, 11,793 participants; high-certainty evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 17 (95% CI 13 to 112). We observed similar findings when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. The certainty of the evidence for the analyses comparing different classes of antidepressants to placebo was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This review added to the growing literature on antidepressants in the treatment of GAD. We have high confidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo at improving treatment response and that antidepressants have similar acceptability to placebo. Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo. We are highly confident in this evidence. This review identified some important gaps in the literature on antidepressants for GAD and can be used as a tool to guide future research. Future studies may be more transparent with their methodology and outcome reporting. Future reviews may also include people with comorbidities, and explore other sources of heterogeneity.

### Pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder [^115VwRSw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Less than one third of people afflicted with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experience spontaneous remission, and the symptoms of GAD wax and wane throughout a person's life. The burden of GAD may be reduced with psychopharmacologic therapy. The medications with the most evidence of efficacy in GAD are the benzodiazepines, including a new long-acting formulation of alprazolam. These drugs have a low incidence of side effects but may cause physical dependence, withdrawal, and sedation. Antidepressants are also efficacious in GAD but act less quickly than benzodiazepines. Tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine may substantially reduce symptoms of anxiety but are not considered a first-line therapy because of their side effects spectrum. The extended-release formulation of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline are also efficacious in GAD. While their association with sexual dysfunction may be intolerable for some adults, these drugs may be more appropriate than the benzodiazepines because their chronic use does not lead to dependence. Buspirone also significantly reduces symptoms of GAD and is associated with less sexual dysfunction than SSRIs and less sedation than benzodiazepines. Combining antidepressant and benzodiazepine therapy or medication treatment and psychotherapy may lead to an increase in improvement in patients not responding to 1 treatment approach alone. The most effective treatment for managing the recurrent symptoms of this chronic disorder will remain unknown until more long-term studies using both drug and nondrug therapies are conducted. Remission rates are still only about 40%, signifying the need for improved treatment interventions.

### Switching from long-term benzodiazepine therapy to pregabalin in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116X3NEc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in facilitating taper off chronic benzodiazepines, outpatients (N = 106) with a lifetime diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (current diagnosis could be subthreshold) who had been treated with a benzodiazepine for 8–52 weeks were stabilized for 2–4 weeks on alprazolam in the range of 1–4 mg/day. Patients were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pregabalin 300–600 mg/day or placebo while undergoing a gradual benzodiazepine taper at a rate of 25% per week, followed by a 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase during which they continued double-blind study treatment. Outcome measures included ability to remain benzodiazepine-free (primary) as well as changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM)-A and Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). At endpoint, a non-significant higher proportion of patients remained benzodiazepine-free receiving pregabalin compared with placebo (51.4% vs 37.0%). Treatment with pregabalin was associated with significantly greater endpoint reduction in the HAM-A total score versus placebo (-2.5 vs +1.3; p < 0.001), and lower endpoint mean PWC scores (6.5 vs 10.3; p = 0.012). Thirty patients (53%) in the pregabalin group and 19 patients (37%) in the placebo group completed the study, reducing the power to detect a significant difference on the primary outcome. The results on the anxiety and withdrawal severity measures suggest that switching to pregabalin may be a safe and effective method for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

### Generalized anxiety disorder in primary care: emerging issues in management and treatment [^115xpGpW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly prevalent in primary care patients and is a source of major morbidity. The low rate of recognition and diagnosis of GAD is often the result of insufficient knowledge on the part of primary care physicians, time pressures, and competing demands during patients' visits. Patient attribution of symptoms and the stigma related to mental illness also contribute to underrecognition. Other contributing factors include the natural history of GAD, the bimodal age of presentation, a chronic but waxing and waning course, frequent comorbidity with other anxiety and depressive disorders, and the controversy regarding the best diagnostic criteria. However, proper diagnosis is critical to appropriate management. Primary care management of GAD and associated comorbidities includes education about the nature of GAD as a medical disorder that is amenable to treatment and counseling about treatment alternatives and coping strategies. Most patients with GAD suffer from insomnia, and treating insomnia can be of great benefit to them. While cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation therapy are effective in treating GAD, most patients in primary care settings are likely to require pharmacologic treatment. Although commonly used, benzodiazepines and their short-term benefits are overshadowed by their decreased long-term effectiveness, their minimal treatment of psychic symptoms, and their degradation of patient performance. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is indicated for the short-term treatment of GAD, although adequate data supporting the use of most SSRIs for GAD are not yet available. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine provides a treatment option resulting in both short- and long-term improvement of symptoms, attaining not only a response but also remission from GAD and prevention of relapse.

### Magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^111NfZSA]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Several medications commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been designated "potentially inappropriate" for use in patients aged ≥ 65 years because their risks may outweigh their potential benefits. The actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however.

Methods

Using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (GP) in Germany, we identified all patients, aged ≥ 65 years, with any GP office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of GAD (ICD-10 diagnosis code F41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 ("GAD patients"). Among GAD-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected TCAs, and hydroxyzine were designated "potentially inappropriate" for use in patients aged ≥ 65 years, based on published criteria.

Results

A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate.

Conclusion

GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with GAD for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks.

### Benzodiazepines: risks and benefits. A reconsideration [^115m6BNC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there have been further developments in our knowledge of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines, and of the risks and benefits of alternatives to benzodiazepines. Representatives drawn from the Psychopharmacology Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Association for Psychopharmacology together examined these developments, and have provided this joint statement with recommendations for clinical practice. The working group was mindful of widespread concerns about benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. The group believes that whenever benzodiazepines are prescribed, the potential for dependence or other harmful effects must be considered. However, the group also believes that the risks of dependence associated with long-term use should be balanced against the benefits that in many cases follow from the short or intermittent use of benzodiazepines and the risk of the underlying conditions for which treatment is being provided.

### Coprescribed benzodiazepines in older adults receiving antidepressants for anxiety and depressive disorders: association with treatment outcomes [^112NGdSo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is a paucity of data on the effects of coprescribed benzodiazepines on treatment response variability and adherence to antidepressant pharmacotherapy for depression and anxiety in late life. The objective of this transdiagnostic analysis was to examine the effect of benzodiazepines on treatment outcomes in older patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

Secondary analyses of data from 2 clinical trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for GAD (escitalopram vs placebo, 2006–2009) or MDD (open treatment with venlafaxine, 2009–2014) were conducted. Participants included 640 adults aged 60+ years with DSM-IV-defined GAD (n = 177) or MDD (n = 463). Benzodiazepine data were collected at baseline. Adherence and treatment response were assessed over 12 weeks. The analysis addressed whether coprescribed benzodiazepines are associated with treatment response, antidepressant medication adherence, dropout, final dose of antidepressant medication, and report of antidepressant-related adverse effects.

Results

Participants with GAD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were treated with a lower mean dosage of escitalopram and were less likely to complete the trial; there was no difference in adherence or treatment response. Participants with MDD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were less likely to tolerate a therapeutic dose of venlafaxine and reported more medication-related adverse effects; there was no difference in adherence, dropout, or treatment response.

Conclusions

Coprescription of benzodiazepines was associated with increased dropout in older patients with GAD and more medication-related adverse effects in older patients with MDD. However, with the systematic clinical attention offered in a clinical trial, they do not impede treatment response. Clinicians should be aware that a coprescribed benzodiazepine may be a marker of a more challenging treatment course.

Trial Registration

Data analyzed were from studies with ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00892047 and NCT00105586.

### Meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of benzodiazepines and antidepressants for psychic versus somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder [^111B4hgE]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are effective agents for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with the HAM-A frequently used as a primary outcome measure. The GAD literature is inconsistent regarding which medications are more effective for somatic versus psychic symptoms of GAD, and treatment guidelines do not advocate for prescribing based on subtype. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether benzodiazepines and antidepressants have a differential impact on the somatic versus psychic subscales of the HAM-A in GAD.

Methods

An electronic search was undertaken for randomized controlled trials of either benzodiazepines or antidepressants for GAD that reported treatment response using the HAM-A subscales. Data were extracted by independent reviewers. A random effects assessment of weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals and subgroup difference was applied. All analysis was done on SPSS 26. An assessment of bias, and of quality of evidence was performed.

Results

24 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria: 18 antidepressant trials, 5 benzodiazepine trials and 1 of both. 14 studies were assessed as having between some and high risk of bias, while 10 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Benzodiazepines (WMD of 1.81 [CI 1.03, 2.58]) were significantly more effective than antidepressants (WMD of 0.83 [CI 0.64, 1.02]) for reducing somatic symptoms of GAD (Chi 2 = 5.81, p = 0.02), and were also more effective (WMD of 2.46 [CI 1.83, 3.09]) in reducing psychic symptoms than antidepressants (WMD of 1.83 [CI 1.55, 2.10]), although this comparison did not reach statistical significance (Chi 2 = 3.31, p = 0.07).

Conclusion

The finding that benzodiazepines were significantly more effective than antidepressants for somatic symptoms needs to be weighed up against potential benefits of antidepressants over benzodiazepines. It may be useful for future treatment guidelines for GAD to explicitly consider symptom subtype.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1141JdpN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Purpose

The following medical and professional societies partnered to develop and disseminate this Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering (hereafter referred to as the Guideline):
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)
American Academy of Neurology (AAN)
American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA)
American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)
American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists (AAPP)
American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT)
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)
American Geriatrics Society (AGS)
American Psychiatric Association (APA)
American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)

This Guideline provides information on evidence-informed and consensus-based strategies to help clinicians determine whether tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medications may be appropriate for a given patient and, if so, how to taper them. This Guideline applies to adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence. Note that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with BZD use and is distinct from BZD use disorder. Additional considerations for patients with substance use disorder (SUD) are discussed separately in the section " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders". Clinicians in palliative and end-of-life care settings are not the intended audience for this Guideline.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a wide range of conditions, including anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures, and are commonly prescribed. They are important therapeutic tools. However, use of these medications is associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcohol or opioids. – The risk–benefit balance of BZD prescribing may shift over time as patients age and their physical or mental health conditions and other prescribed medications change. Because physical dependence is an expected outcome of BZD use, discontinuation can be challenging. When BZDs are used regularly, abrupt discontinuation (i.e. stopping the medication without a taper) or precipitous dose decreases can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.

### Magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^113T6T37]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic condition that is characterized by persistent worry or anxiety that occurs more days than not over a period of at least six months. The condition is frequently difficult to diagnose because of the variety of clinical presentations and the common occurrence of comorbid medical or other psychiatric conditions. Lifetime prevalence has been estimated to be between 4% and 6%; the disease is more common among women than men. GAD is the most common anxiety disorder among patients presenting to primary care physicians.

Several different types of medications are often used to treat GAD – specifically, benzodiazepines (e.g. flurazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide), buspirone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, opipramol), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. paroxetine. escitalopram), and venlafaxine (a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). Among these available therapies, benzodiazepines have long been the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for GAD. While effective, benzodiazepines are associated with excessive sedation and motor impairment; their long-term use is also associated with a risk of physical dependence as well as withdrawal when therapy is discontinued. In one study comparing 4554 persons prescribed benzodiazepines with 13,662 persons receiving other (i.e. non-benzodiazepine) medications who were matched on age, sex, and calendar month in which therapy was initiated, Oster and colleagues found that patients in the former group had a 15% higher risk of an accident-related medical event; those who filled three or more prescriptions for benzodiazepines had a 30% higher risk compared with those who filled only one such prescription.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: common questions and answers [^117UkHzB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### Results of a naturalistic longitudinal study of benzodiazepine and SSRI use in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia [^115TeyJh]. Depression and Anxiety (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has brought major new developments in the psychopharmacologic management of generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia. We examined medication-prescribing patterns for the treatment of these anxiety disorders for 12 years to assess changes in patients' anti-anxiety psychotropic medication usage during that period of evolving practice guidelines. We examined psychotropic medication use in 305 patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 232 with social phobia enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Project (HARP), a prospective, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. Psychotropic treatment patterns seem to have remained relatively stable over 12 years with benzodiazepines the medications most commonly used for both generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia. Comparatively, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and venlafaxine usage as stand-alone medications for these disorders remained low throughout the follow-up period. At the 12-year follow-up, 24% of patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 30% of patients with social phobia were utilizing neither an SSRI/selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) nor a benzodiazepine. Treatment recommendations for use of SSRIs and venlafaxine in the management of generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia initially promulgated in 1998 had a modest impact on changes in psychopharmacologic practice 4–5 years later. Difficulties in the implementation of treatment guidelines are discussed.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111wCmGW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering process — clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation); clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); and clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Attitudes toward benzodiazepines over the years [^117SrbwE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines have been used extensively for the treatment of anxiety and related disorders since the 1960s. Although they have been proven to be effective as first-line treatment for anxiety disorders, during the 1980s public perception and concern for abuse liability and physical dependence with long-term use gave rise to a great deal of controversy. Negative perceptions toward the use of benzodiazepines for treating anxiety not only caused severely ill patients to go untreated or under-treated but also called into question whether the illness itself was worthy of treatment. Although new pharmacologic and psychological treatments for anxiety are available, psychopharmacologists continue to endorse benzodiazepines as primary or adjunct treatment for anxiety disorders. The intent of this article is to provide a historic overview of these issues and to offer some general clinical principles to help minimize the risk of abuse and dependence with benzodiazepine use.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons. For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence). We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence). The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence). Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence). Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement.

### Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^117JwKbi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

No systematic review or meta-analysis using a hard outcome has been conducted on the role of benzodiazepines for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD based on trial drop-out rates. We used a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared any of the three best established benzodiazepines (diazepam, Lorazepam and aLprazolam) against placebo. Our primary outcome for effectiveness was withdrawal for any reason. Our secondary outcome tapping efficacy was withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, and that tapping side effects was withdrawals due to adverse events. We included 23 trials. Pooled analysis indicated less risk of treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy for benzodiazepines, compared to placebo, relative risk (RR) 0.29 (95% CI 0.18–0.45; p < 0.00001). Nevertheless, pooled analysis showed no conclusive results for risk of all-cause patient discontinuation, RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.62–1.00; p = 0.05). Meta-regression model showed that 74% of the variation in logRR across the studies was explained by year of publication (p < 0.001). This systematic review did not find convincing evidence of the short-term effectiveness of the benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD. On the other hand, for the outcome of efficacy, this review found robust evidence in favour of benzodiazepines. Due to the heterogeneity induced by year of publication, three hypotheses are plausibLe when it comes to being able to account for the differences between efficacy and effectiveness observed in the outcomes (publication bias, quality of the trial literature and a non-differential response to the placebo effect).

### Magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Germany among older patients with generalized anxiety disorder [^1171k9S1]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

GAD can be difficult to treat, and several different medications – including benzodiazepines, buspirone, TCAs, and SSRIs – are recommended for use in these patients. Although these therapies are often of benefit, they also can confer significant risks in older adults. Because of these risks, some of these drugs have been designated potentially inappropriate for use in persons aged 65 years or older.

Using the 1997 Beers criteria and subsequent updates, we found that four out of every 10 patients – and two out of every three of those who received any GAD-related therapy – received medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate for use among persons aged 65 years and older. Notably, use of these medications did not differ between the "young" old versus the "old" old (i.e. aged 65–74 years vs ≥ 75 years).

Benzodiazepines have long been the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for GAD, and they were the medication most commonly dispensed among subjects in our study: 44% of patients in our study received these agents. Paradoxically, they also comprise the majority of agents deemed potentially inappropriate for use in the elderly, due in part to an increased risk of falls, hip fractures, drug-induced disorders of cognition, and motor vehicle accidents. We note that GPs dispensed short-acting benzodiazepines at daily doses deemed potentially inappropriate to 10% of study subjects; they also dispensed long-acting benzodiazepines – which are deemed potentially inappropriate in older patients regardless of daily dose – to 31% of patients. About one in 10 patients in our study received TCAs deemed potentially inappropriate – either amitriptyline or doxepin – despite the fact that several other TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline) are available with similar efficacy that are better tolerated by older patients. We are unaware of any other study of potentially inappropriate prescribing in patients (of any age) with GAD. Compared with rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing reported among the elderly in general, the rates we report are considerably higher. This finding is consistent, however, with the fact that many of the medications that have been designated by some experts as potentially inappropriate in the elderly are also commonly recommended by other experts to treat GAD.

### Azapirones for generalized anxiety disorder [^114F8Yie]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Azapirones are a group of drugs that work at the 5-HT1A receptor and are used to treat patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, several studies have shown conflicting results. Whether azapirones are useful as first line treatment in general anxiety disorders still needs to be answered.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and the acceptability of azapirones for the treatment of GAD.

Search Strategy

Initially the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched, incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005), EMBASE (1980 to June 2005), CINAHL (1982 to June 2005), PsycLIT (1974 to June 2005), PSYNDEX (1977 to June 2005), and LILACS (1982 to June 2005). Subsequently the revised Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 21–10–2005. Reference lists of relevant papers and major text books of anxiety disorder were examined. Authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for knowledge of suitable trials, published or unpublished. Specialist journals concerning azapirones were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of azapirones, including buspirone versus placebo and/or other medication and/or psychological treatment, were included. Participants were males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the original reports independently by CC, MA and MT. The main outcomes studied were related to the objectives stated above. Data were analysed for generalized anxiety disorder versus placebo, versus other medication and versus psychological treatment separately. Data were analysed using Review Manager Version 4.2.7.

Main Results

Thirty six trials were included in the review, reporting on 5908 participants randomly allocated to azapirones and/or placebo, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, psychotherapy or kava kava. Azapirones, including buspirone, were superior to placebo in treating GAD. The calculated number needed to treat for azapirones using the Clinical Global Impression scale was 4.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16 to 15.4). Azapirones may be less effective than benzodiazepines and we were unable to conclude if azapirones were superior to antidepressants, kava kava or psychotherapy. Azapirones appeared to be well tolerated. Fewer participants stopped taking benzodiazepines compared to azapirones. The length of studies ranged from four to nine weeks, with one study lasting 14 weeks.

Authors' Conclusions

Azapirones appeared to be useful in the treatment of GAD, particularly for those participants who had not been on a benzodiazepine. Azapirones may not be superior to benzodiazepines and do not appear as acceptable as benzodiazepines. Side effects appeared mild and non serious in the azapirone treated group. Longer term studies are needed to show that azapirones are effective in treating GAD, which is a chronic long-term illness.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

### Pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder [^117JG7sj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines have traditionally been used to treat acute anxiety disorders, but they are not ideal in the treatment of chronic generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Following long-term therapy, benzodiazepines have the potential to produce dependency and withdrawal symptoms. In addition, although agents such as the benzodiazepines and buspirone alleviate anxiety, they have little effect on depression, which is a common comorbidity of GAD. Antidepressants have long been viewed as promising alternatives to benzodiazepines for the treatment of some types of anxiety. Although they have been shown to be useful in the treatment of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder/social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, they have not until recently been regarded as potential therapies for GAD. Treatment with antidepressants has opened up a new area of investigation into the pharmacotherapy of GAD, with a growing body of evidence supporting the role of therapies such as paroxetine and venlafaxine extended release.

Patient preferences vary, with focus group interest because they are effective for short-term anxiety relief, but these medications are ineffective in the long term.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114pu3vn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Many of the topics discussed in this Guideline lacked controlled studies. Our systematic review found no trials comparing BZD tapering strategies or other important aspects of managing patients who are taking prescribed BZDs and likely to have developed physical dependence. Further research into best practices for BZD tapering strategies that support patient safety and optimal outcomes is urgently needed.

### The role of extended-release benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety: a risk-benefit evaluation with a focus on extended-release alprazolam [^114y6iso]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself. The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation. The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation. This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.

### Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for adults with major depression [^113mQrWo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and adding benzodiazepines to antidepressant treatment is common practice to treat people with major depression. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether this combined treatment is more effective and not any more harmful than antidepressants alone. It has been suggested that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence. This is the 2019 updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2005. This update follows a new protocol to conform with the most recent Cochrane methodology guidelines, with the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE evaluations for quality of evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone for major depression in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to May 2019. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. We excluded studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at depression and anxiety disorders concurrently. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at or above the minimum effective dose as presented by Hansen 2009 or according to the North American or European regulations. The combination therapy had to last at least four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We entered data into Review Manager 5. We used intention-to-treat data. We combined continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Regarding the primary outcome of acceptability, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.

Main Results

We identified 10 studies published between 1978 to 2002 involving 731 participants. Six studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), two studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one study used another heterocyclic antidepressant and one study used TCA or heterocyclic antidepressant. Combined therapy of benzodiazepines plus antidepressants was more effective than antidepressants alone for depressive severity in the early phase (four weeks) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.03; 10 studies, 598 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference between treatments in the acute phase (five to 12 weeks) (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.03; 7 studies, 347 participants; low-quality evidence) or in the continuous phase (more than 12 weeks) (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.35; 1 study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence). For acceptability of treatment, there was no difference in the dropouts due to any reason between combined therapy and antidepressants alone (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For response in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.35; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 1 study, 52 participants). For remission in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90, 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.16; 1 study, 52 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between combined therapy and antidepressants alone for anxiety severity in the early phase (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.14; 3 studies, 129 participants) or in the acute phase (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.10; 3 studies, 129 participants). No studies measured severity of insomnia. In terms of adverse effects, the dropout rates due to adverse events were lower for combined therapy than for antidepressants alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, participants in the combined therapy group reported at least one adverse effect more often than participants who received antidepressants alone (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; 7 studies, 510 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Most domains of risk of bias in the majority of the included studies were unclear. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting were problematic due to insufficient details reported in most of the included studies and lack of availability of the study protocols. The greatest limitation in the quality of evidence was issues with attrition.

Authors' Conclusions

Combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression severity, response in depression and remission in depression in the early phase. However, these effects were not maintained in the acute or the continuous phase. Combined therapy resulted in fewer dropouts due to adverse events than antidepressants alone, but combined therapy was associated with a greater proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. The moderate quality evidence of benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in the early phase must be balanced judiciously against possible harms and consideration given to other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant monotherapy may be considered inadequate. We need long-term, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to compare combination therapy against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114Krj2d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODOLOGY

ASAM's Quality Improvement Council (QIC) and Clinical Practice Guideline Methodology and Oversight Committee (CPG-MOS) oversaw the development of this Guideline. The FDA provided guidance on the content and development of the Guideline but did not dictate the content. The QIC, working with partner professional societies and the FDA, oversaw the appointment of a Clinical Guideline Committee (CGC) comprised of clinicians representing ten medical and professional societies with broad subject matter expertise across medicine, psychiatry, and pharmacology. A panel of individuals who have lived experience with BZD tapering (the Patient Panel) provided input during the development of the Guideline.

The following key clinical questions were addressed in the systematic literature review:
What is the efficacy and/or safety of tapering strategies for BZDs?
What factors influence the outcomes of BZD tapering and should be monitored?
How can shared decision-making and patient-centered health care be utilized to support the effectiveness and safety of BZD tapering?

These questions were used to develop a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework for identifying relevant research literature to answer each of the key clinical questions.
Population: Adults who have been using one or more BZD medication for at least 2–4 weeks, including those with benzodiazepine use disorder
Intervention: two types of interventions were considered: Interventions that promote the successful discontinuation of BZD use Interventions that manage withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing BZDs
Comparator: alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition
Outcome: BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g. insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events

### Antidepressant and benzodiazepine for major depression [^115zzuhb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety frequently coexists with depression. Adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants is commonly used to treat people with depression, although there has been no convincing evidence to show that such a combination is more effective than antidepressants alone and that there are suggestions that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and that their chronic use carries risks of dependence.

Objectives

To determine whether, among adult patients with major depression, adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants brings about any benefit in terms of symptomatic recovery or side-effects in the short term (less than 8 weeks) and long term (more than 2 months), in comparison with treatment by antidepressants alone.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1972 to September 1997), EMBASE (1980 to September 1997), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1972 to September 1997), Biological Abstracts (1984 to September 1997), LILACS (1980 to September 1997), PsycLIT (1974 to September 1997), the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 1997) and the trial register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched March 1999), combined with hand searching, reference searching, SciSearch and personal contacts.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant-benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressant alone for adult patients with major depression. Exclusion criteria are: antidepressant dosage lower than 100 mg of imipramine or its equivalent daily and duration of trial shorter than four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility and quality of the studies. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. Standardized weighted mean differences and relative risks were estimated with random effects model. The dropouts were assigned the least favourable outcome. Two sensitivity analyses examined the effect of this assumption as well as the effect of including medium quality studies. Three a priori subgroup analyses were performed with regard to the patients with or without comorbid anxiety and with regard to the type.

Main Results

Aggregating nine studies with a total of 679 patients, the combination therapy group was less likely to drop out than the antidepressant alone group (relative risk 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.81). The intention-to-treat analysis (with people dropping out assigned the least favourable outcome) showed that the combination group was more likely to show improvement in their depression (defined as 50% or greater reduction in the depression scale from baseline) (relative risk 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.27 at one week and relative risk 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.66 at four weeks). The difference was no longer significant at six to eight weeks. None of the included RCTs lasted longer than eight weeks. The patients allocated to the combination therapy were less likely to drop out from the treatment due to side effects than those receiving antidepressants alone (relative risk 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.86). However, these two groups of patients were equally likely to report at least one side effect (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.07).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The potential benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant must be balanced judiciously against possible harms including development of dependence and accident proneness, on the one hand, and against continued suffering following no response and drop-out, on the other.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111WUNaY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — implementation considerations: When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process. When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent) and discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) that may be more effective and carry less risk (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia). The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.

### Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents [^117JrqZt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Comparative safety of chronic versus intermittent benzodiazepine prescribing in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^111h36bw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

In illustrating excess risks for chronic use over intermittent use, we have captured an issue with benzodiazepines, which cannot be revealed by studies that simply undertake meta-analysis of side effects in short-term trials. A good example of such a study is the recent meta-analysis of, which compared the side effect burden of benzodiazepines in panic disorder treatment trials of up to 12 weeks duration to that of SSRIs, concluding that incidence of adverse effects was slightly lower in people randomized to benzodiazepines. While such a meta-analysis is informative, it cannot address the issue of excess harms of benzodiazepines with chronic use over the longer periods we have examined in this study.

While this study illustrates that chronic benzodiazepine use carries enhanced risks of most of the adverse outcomes relative to intermittent use, especially in older men, it must be recognized that the excess risk described is merely one factor to be taken into consideration when deciding whether ongoing benzodiazepine use is acceptable or unacceptable for a given patient who has been taking these drugs for long periods and is deriving benefit, especially where there has been no evidence of dose escalation or tolerance to the therapeutic effect. Clearly, when discussing the way forward with patients in this situation, the excess risks we have enumerated here must be considered against the risks of withdrawal and rebound of symptoms of their original disorder which may occur if established benzodiazepine treatment is reduced in dose and/or frequency, as well as the potential adverse effects of other medications that might be introduced to allow this to happen.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111UY244]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — scope and exclusions states that the Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, including assessing risks and benefits, partnering with patients, level of care, and tapering strategies with withdrawal management. It pertains to patients taking BZDs regularly and at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, and addresses population-specific considerations including co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, SUD, other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients. It is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly, nor to those prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal); non-BZD medications acting on GABA receptors and children and adolescents (i.e., < 18 years old) are beyond the scope.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112EKKmp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

### New research on anxiety disorders in the elderly and an update on evidence-based treatments [^114oQJyN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are frequently encountered in the elderly, but they are largely undetected and untreated. Epidemiological studies indicate a prevalence ranging from 1.2 to 15%. With the exception of generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, which can often start in late life, most anxiety disorders in older patients are chronic and have their onset earlier in life. Anxiety disorders are an often unrecognized cause of distress, disability, and mortality risk in older adults, and they have been associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cognitive decline. The mechanisms of anxiety in older adults differ from that in younger adults due to age-related neuropathology, as well as the loss and isolation so prominent in late life. Our review intends to provide a comprehensive summary of the most recent research done in the field of anxiety disorders in the elderly. Recent findings in clinical research, neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, and neuropsychology are covered. An update on treatment options is discussed, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological alternatives.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

### Comorbidity of depression and anxiety in the elderly [^1161YQdG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with depression commonly suffer from concurrent symptoms of anxiety or comorbid anxiety disorders. Such comorbidity is associated with a more severe presentation of depressive illness, including greater suicidality. Additionally, most antidepressant treatment studies of elderly individuals with depression have found poorer treatment outcomes in those with comorbid anxiety, for example, delayed or diminished response and increased likelihood of dropout from treatment. In terms of treatment of anxious depression, there is evidence that tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not different from each other in terms of efficacy or tolerability. Rather than the specific choice of antidepressant medication, it appears that quality of clinical management has the greatest impact on likelihood of remission in anxious depressed elderly individuals. Co-prescription of benzodiazepines is sometimes warranted for severe anxiety, but increases the risk of cognitive or motor impairment. Psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, which are efficacious for late-life depression in general, should also be considered for treatment alone or in combination with appropriate medication. Future research areas are also addressed in this paper.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ccKRN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage a wide range of conditions, including acute conditions (e.g. panic and acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures) and common chronic conditions (e.g. anxiety disorders, primary insomnia). These medications are commonly prescribed and represent important therapeutic tools; however, data on long-term safety and efficacy are limited. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids. –

Since 2000, fatal overdoses involving BZDs have increased nearly tenfold, often involving the combination of opioids and BZDs. Although prescribing rates for BZDs have fallen since the most recent peak in 2013, in the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.1% of US adults reported use of BZDs in the past year, with more than 15% of those reporting BZD misuse. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling BZD prescriptions increased from 4.1 to 5.6%, while the total quantity of BZD prescriptions filled more than tripled, from 1.1 to 3.6 kg lorazepam equivalents per 100,000 adults. Over this time, emergency department (ED) visits related to BZDs also tripled, and BZD-related overdose deaths quadrupled. Since 2013, however, BZD prescriptions dispensed from outpatient and mail-order pharmacies have fallen by approximately 33%.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114bTsdh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long-term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team, as appropriate. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. As emphasized in an FDA advisory, buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system. Whereas the combined use of these medications increases risks, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks.

If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine therapy at current dosages, decisions about tapering medications (e.g. whether to taper opioids first, taper benzodiazepines first, or consider carefully transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine before tapering benzodiazepines) should be individualized and reevaluated over time. Considerations include patient priorities, the patient's clinical considerations, the patient's response to therapeutic changes, consultation with other clinicians managing the patient's care, and, consultation with other specialists (e.g. an addiction specialist) if needed. Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. Tapering rates should be individualized. Examples of benzodiazepine tapers and tips for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal are available. Cognitive behavioral therapy increases tapering success rates and might be particularly helpful for patients struggling with a benzodiazepine taper. If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered. Clinicians should communicate with mental health professionals managing the patient to discuss the patient's needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

Recommendation 12

Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1178XPmj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Older adults — The AGS Beers Criteria recommends avoiding the use of both long- and short-acting benzodiazepines (BZD) in adults over 65 years of age; clinicians should generally consider alternative treatment options with more favorable safety profiles. The CGC recommends that clinicians make every effort to taper BZD use in older adults unless there are compelling reasons for continuation; however, they noted that the decision to taper should still be made based on a careful assessment of risks and benefits for the patient, and BZD are sometimes prescribed to control agitation in older adults when the benefits of controlling the patient's agitation may outweigh the potential adverse effects of the BZD and be a compelling reason for continuing the medication.

### Are benzodiazepines still the medication of choice for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia? [^112F2Ehv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, pharmacological treatment guidelines for panic disorder have changed as newer treatment options have become available. The authors examined how the use of psychotropic drugs has shifted over the course of 10 years to determine if prescribing patterns have changed to reflect these revised treatment guidelines.

Method

A total of 443 patients with panic disorder were enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project, a prospective longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. These patients were interviewed over the course of 10 years to examine their use of psychotropic medications.

Results

Despite efforts aimed at increasing the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with panic disorder (e.g. APA's practice guideline for panic disorder, Food and Drug Administration approval of particular SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder), only a modest increase in their use was found. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder. In comparison, SSRI use throughout the follow-up period has remained low. Patients using an SSRI did not have a more favorable clinical course than those using a benzodiazepine, nor were there significantly better rates of remission in patients using SSRIs and benzodiazepines concomitantly.

Conclusions

These results highlight a gap between pharmacological treatment guidelines and actual delivery of care in that recommendations to use SSRIs to treat panic disorder are not being followed. Factors potentially associated with promoting and ignoring treatment recommendations are discussed.

Benzodiazepine tapering implementation — level of care and follow-up: Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so. When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed, and should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

Benzodiazepine risk–benefit assessment and misuse screening — clinicians should first consider the risks and benefits of continued benzodiazepine (BZD) use, and if the risks outweigh the benefits, clinicians should then consider the potential risks associated with tapering. Risk–benefit assessments should include regular screening for signs of BZD misuse and use disorder; if patients exhibit signs of potential BZD misuse (such as frequently requesting early refills, increased dosage, or number of pills), clinicians should assess the possibility of BZD misuse, related risks, and if tapering is indicated, and drug testing may help differentiate between medication misuse and diversion; patients who are misusing medications should be assessed or referred for further assessment and treatment for potential BZD use disorder. When determining the balance of risks and benefits, the page lists guiding questions regarding benefits of ongoing prescribing versus taper, the significance and imminence of risks and ability to manage them, and whether alternative interventions could achieve similar benefits, and notes that risks evolve with age and with changes in health, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, nicotine/tobacco use, and other medications.

Patient engagement and shared decision-making — benzodiazepine tapering "can be a challenging process for both clinicians and patients", and decisions "relating to whether, when, and how to taper are often complex and need to consider a variety of factors, including each patient's needs, preferences, and concerns"; many patients "will be anxious about tapering a medication they believe to be beneficial" and "may be understandably afraid of the potential for withdrawal symptoms or recurrence of physical or mental health symptoms", so "Patient education is critical during the BZD tapering process".

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, CGS 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain careful monitoring for acute BZRA withdrawal symptoms and consider using validated tools (such as Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepine) for guidance, and manage with symptom-driven judicious use of an appropriate BZRA.

Adjunctive interventions during benzodiazepine tapering — clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation), and clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when symptoms significantly interfere with the taper; however, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Screening for anxiety disorders in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115Xjo3o]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — Two randomized clinical trials (n = 918) directly evaluated screening for anxiety disorders in primary care adults, and neither trial found differences in anxiety, depressive, or general psychological symptom severity at 13 to 22 weeks of follow-up. Regarding treatment, 24 RCTs (n = 5307) and 8 systematic reviews (44 RCTs; n = 11 030) assessed psychological interventions; in primary care patients with anxiety disorders they showed a small but statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.41 [95%CI, −0.58 to −0.23]) but not in mixed anxiety/depression populations (SMD, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.39 to 0.03]). Existing systematic reviews reported reduced anxiety symptoms, including SMD among persons with generalized anxiety disorder of −0.80 [95% CI, −0.93 to −0.67], and functional status improvements (SMD, −0.63 [95% CI, −0.83 to −0.43]; 33 RCTs [n = 3063]). In older adults, only 7 RCTs (n = 215) were found with a pooled SMD of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.94 to −0.38). Pharmacotherapy evidence in primary care included only 2 RCTs (venlafaxine and escitalopram), both showing a benefit; broader reviews reported improved outcomes with antidepressants versus placebo, with generalized anxiety disorder SMD for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.90 to −0.43; 23 studies [n = 2142]).

### Lorazepam [^113yuhcX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind; benzodiazepines should not be used in such patients without adequate anti-depressant therapy.

Lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea syndrome).

Elderly or debilitated patients may be more susceptible to the sedative effects of lorazepam. Therefore, these patients should be monitored frequently and have their dosage adjusted carefully according to patient response; the initial dosage should not exceed 2 mg.

Paradoxical reactions have been occasionally reported during benzodiazepine use. Such reactions may be more likely to occur in children and the elderly. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.

The usual precautions for treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed. As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; therefore, lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy. Dosage for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency should be adjusted carefully according to patient response; lower doses may be sufficient in such patients.

In patients where gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disorders coexist with anxiety, it should be noted that lorazepam has not been shown to be of significant benefit in treating the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular component.
