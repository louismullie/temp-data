## Question

Mavenclad therapy guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Mavenclad (cladribine) therapy guidelines for multiple sclerosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and limitations of use. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and why it supports a pulsed, two-course regimen. Next, I will review the exact dosing schedule and administration details, followed by pre-treatment assessments and safety monitoring. After that, I need to examine key safety warnings, including malignancy, teratogenicity, infections, and lymphopenia, and their management. Finally, I will consider special populations, long-term strategy, and patient counseling, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding with a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication and scope. Mavenclad is indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults, including relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, but it is not recommended for clinically isolated syndrome due to its safety profile, and its use is generally reserved for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or cannot tolerate, an alternate MS therapy, which frames it as a high-efficacy option with important safety considerations [^113XNhfq] [^113fFATg].

> I will now examine the mechanism to ensure the dosing paradigm makes sense. Cladribine is a purine nucleoside analog prodrug that, once phosphorylated, impairs DNA synthesis and repair in lymphocytes lacking efficient purine salvage pathways, leading to selective B- and T-cell apoptosis; this produces a dose-dependent, delayed nadir in lymphocytes around 2–3 months with subsequent immune reconstitution, supporting a pulsed, two-year induction strategy rather than continuous therapy [^111g1G8m] [^1131MS8g].

> Wait, let me verify the exact dosing schedule because I recall conflicting day counts. The FDA-labeled regimen is a cumulative 3.5 mg/kg divided into two yearly treatment courses of 1.75 mg/kg each; each course consists of two cycles separated by 23–27 days, with the second course given at least 43 weeks after the last dose of the first course, and no additional treatment during the next two years; administration is 1–2 tablets once daily for 4–5 consecutive days per cycle, with tablets swallowed whole and separated by at least 3 hours from other oral medications during dosing weeks [^115Swri9]. Hold on, I initially thought some sources said 4 days and others 5 days; yes, different summaries list 4 or 5 days, but the core principle is the same: the total per-cycle dose is delivered over 4–5 days depending on the exact tablet schedule, always totaling 1.75 mg/kg per course, so the variation is in the daily tablet count, not the total dose [^1164Bfcy] [^112y61sY] [^1156p8YT].

> Next, I should review pre-treatment assessments to mitigate foreseeable risks. I need to ensure pregnancy is excluded in females of reproductive potential, screen for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis, assess for active infections and delay therapy until controlled, obtain a baseline MRI to contextualize future PML risk, check a CBC with differential including lymphocytes, and obtain liver enzymes and bilirubin. I should also confirm that live or live-attenuated vaccines are given at least 4–6 weeks prior to starting, and that VZV seronegative patients are vaccinated and VZV seropositive patients receive recombinant zoster vaccine, ideally before initiation [^116dNNkA] [^112vXEUE].

> I need to check the malignancy risk and boxed warning carefully. Mavenclad carries a boxed warning for increased malignancy risk; in trials, malignancies occurred more frequently with cladribine than placebo, and additional treatment within two years after the two standard courses increased malignancy incidence, so no additional treatment should be given during the two-year treatment-free interval; patients with current malignancy should not receive Mavenclad, and those with prior malignancy or elevated risk require individualized risk–benefit assessment with adherence to standard cancer screening guidelines [^1168tMpQ] [^114a8Ait].

> Let me consider teratogenicity and reproductive planning next. Mavenclad is contraindicated in pregnancy and in women and men of reproductive potential who will not use effective contraception; pregnancy must be excluded before each course, and effective contraception is required during dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each course; if pregnancy occurs, therapy should be stopped and the pregnancy safety study should be notified, and breastfeeding should be avoided on treatment days and for 10 days after the last dose [^1131MS8g] [^112US8CK] [^111dgHeb].

> I should double-check infection risk and prophylaxis because this drives monitoring. Serious infections, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases, are increased, with higher risk during severe lymphopenia; herpes zoster is notably more frequent, and anti-herpes prophylaxis is recommended if lymphocytes fall below 200/µL; I need to ensure that patients with lymphocytes below 500/µL are monitored closely for infection and that any active infection is treated before or during therapy as indicated [^111yZyRc] [^116SUKqZ] [^115pJZxJ].

> Now, I will review hematologic monitoring and thresholds. Lymphopenia is expected and dose dependent, with nadirs around 2–3 months; hold therapy if lymphocytes are below 200/µL, and before the second course, lymphocytes should be at least 800/µL; if recovery to 800/µL takes more than 6 months, further Mavenclad treatment should not be given; I should confirm that CBC with differential is checked before each course, at 2 and 6 months within each course, and periodically thereafter, with monthly checks if lymphocytes are below 200/µL [^1131MS8g] [^115pJZxJ] [^116dNNkA].

> But wait, what about liver injury and hepatic impairment. I need to ensure liver enzymes and bilirubin are obtained prior to each cycle and course, and that therapy is interrupted if clinically significant liver injury is suspected; Mavenclad is not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), whereas mild impairment (Child-Pugh A) may be acceptable with monitoring, so I should verify baseline hepatic status and concomitant hepatotoxins before proceeding [^114zN1C7] [^111MbMAH] [^113ijgFB] [^1156ps7P].

> Let me verify special populations and contraindications so I do not miss anything critical. Pediatric use is not established and not recommended due to malignancy risk, geriatric patients require caution given comorbidities, and patients with prior hypersensitivity to cladribine should not be retreated. I should also remember that irradiated blood products are advised if transfusion is needed to mitigate transfusion-associated GVHD risk, and that cardiac failure, though rare, has been reported, so new cardiopulmonary symptoms warrant evaluation [^111dgHeb] [^114zN1C7] [^112Lygrp].

> Next, I should review long-term strategy and what to do after the two-year treatment-free interval. No additional treatment is administered in years 3–4, and the safety and efficacy of reinitiating beyond two years have not been established. Real-world and expert groups suggest that if disease activity recurs, individualized decisions may include retreatment or switching to alternative DMTs, but I need to ensure shared decision-making and careful risk–benefit review given the malignancy signal with earlier re-exposure in trials [^115Swri9] [^112c7EuY] [^116tgNj7].

> I will now examine patient counseling and administration safety because errors here can cause harm. Patients must be told about malignancy and teratogenicity risks, infection precautions, contraception requirements, and the need to avoid breastfeeding on treatment days and for 10 days after the last dose; tablets are cytotoxic and must be handled with dry hands, swallowed whole, and kept in the blister until use, with a 3-hour separation from other oral medications during dosing weeks; if a dose is missed, it should be taken the next day and the cycle extended rather than doubling up [^112US8CK] [^115Swri9] [^112Lygrp].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency I noticed earlier regarding CIS. Some guideline summaries list cladribine as probably effective for delaying conversion from CIS to MS, but the FDA labeling explicitly states Mavenclad is not recommended for CIS due to safety concerns. To reconcile this, I will prioritize the FDA label for U.S. practice and avoid use in CIS despite earlier guideline statements, documenting the rationale for risk–benefit in exceptional circumstances [^114bNkeM] [^113XNhfq].

> In summary, Mavenclad is a pulsed, high-efficacy immune reconstitution therapy for adults with relapsing MS and active secondary progressive MS, delivered as two annual 1.75 mg/kg courses totaling 3.5 mg/kg, with no additional treatment in years 3–4. Success depends on meticulous pre-treatment screening, vigilant infection and hematologic monitoring, strict adherence to contraception and pregnancy avoidance, and careful handling and counseling, all aligned with its boxed warnings and FDA labeling to balance efficacy against malignancy, teratogenicity, and infection risks [^115Swri9] [^1168tMpQ] [^113XNhfq].

---

Mavenclad (cladribine) is indicated for **highly active relapsing-remitting MS** [^113s7oJN] and active secondary progressive MS in adults, typically after inadequate response or intolerance to other DMTs [^113XNhfq]. The recommended regimen is **3.5 mg/kg total**, given as 1.75 mg/kg in year 1 and 1.75 mg/kg in year 2, with no treatment in years 3–4 [^115Swri9]. Before each course, obtain CBC with differential, liver function tests, and infection screening (HIV, HBV, HCV, TB, VZV) [^116dNNkA]; monitor lymphocytes monthly if < 500/µL and provide anti-herpes prophylaxis if < 200/µL [^115pJZxJ]. Mavenclad is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with current malignancy; effective contraception is required during treatment and for 6 months after each course [^1168tMpQ]. Common adverse effects include lymphopenia, infections, and transient liver enzyme elevations; rare risks include malignancy, PML, and severe hepatic injury [^113S5bC5] [^114a8Ait] [^112vXEUE] [^114zN1C7].

---

## Indications and patient selection

Mavenclad is indicated for **highly active relapsing-remitting MS** [^113s7oJN] and active secondary progressive MS in adults, typically after inadequate response or intolerance to other DMTs [^113XNhfq]. It is not recommended for clinically isolated syndrome due to safety concerns [^113XNhfq].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Total dose**: 3.5 mg/kg body weight, divided into two yearly treatment courses of 1.75 mg/kg each [^115Swri9].
- **Year 1**: 1.75 mg/kg administered in two cycles (week 1 and week 5).
- **Year 2**: 1.75 mg/kg administered in two cycles (week 1 and week 5), at least 43 weeks after the last dose of year 1 [^115Swri9].
- **Years 3–4**: No treatment; retreatment after year 4 is not established [^115Swri9].

---

## Pre-treatment assessments and monitoring

Before initiating Mavenclad, perform the following assessments:

| **Assessment** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) with differential | Baseline and before each treatment course; monitor lymphocytes closely [^116dNNkA] |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) | Baseline and before each treatment course [^116dNNkA] |
| Infection screening | - HIV <br/> - Hepatitis B and C <br/> - Tuberculosis <br/> - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [^116dNNkA] |
| Pregnancy test | Required for women of reproductive potential before each course [^116dNNkA] |
| MRI baseline | Baseline MRI recommended to monitor disease progression and detect potential PML [^112vXEUE] |

---

During treatment, monitor **lymphocyte counts monthly** if < 500/µL and provide anti-herpes prophylaxis if < 200/µL [^115pJZxJ].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **pregnancy**, **current malignancy**, **active infections** (HIV, active TB, hepatitis B or C), and hypersensitivity to cladribine [^1168tMpQ] [^111yZyRc]. Precautions include **moderate to severe hepatic impairment** (Child-Pugh B or C) [^111MbMAH] [^113ijgFB], **renal impairment** (use with caution) [^1145Ys1w], and **cardiovascular disease** (monitor for cardiac failure) [^112ZDH7N].

---

## Adverse effects and safety profile

Common adverse effects include **lymphopenia** (87% of patients), **upper respiratory tract infections**, **headache**, and **transient liver enzyme elevations** [^113S5bC5] [^1131MS8g]. Serious adverse effects include **malignancies** (rare but increased risk) [^114a8Ait], **progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)** (rare, monitor closely) [^112vXEUE], and **severe hepatic injury** (rare, monitor liver function) [^114zN1C7].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Contraindicated; effective contraception required during treatment and for 6 months after each course [^1168tMpQ] [^111dgHeb].
- **Pediatric patients**: Safety and efficacy not established [^111dgHeb].
- **Elderly patients**: Use with caution due to increased risk of infections and malignancies [^111dgHeb].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Mavenclad significantly reduces **annualized relapse rate (ARR)** [^114a3Txr], **MRI lesion activity**, and **disability progression** in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS [^111UYHzV]. Its efficacy is comparable to other high-efficacy DMTs, with the advantage of a short treatment duration (two annual courses) followed by a treatment-free period [^115Swri9].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

After completing the two treatment courses, patients should be monitored regularly for disease activity, lymphocyte recovery, and potential adverse effects. Retreatment after year 4 is not established and should be considered only in cases of significant disease recurrence after careful risk–benefit assessment [^115Swri9].

---

Mavenclad is a **high-efficacy DMT** for highly active relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS, characterized by a short treatment duration and a favorable efficacy–safety balance. Careful patient selection, pre-treatment assessments, and ongoing monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks.

5.1 Malignancies

Treatment with MAVENCLAD may increase the risk of malignancy. In controlled and extension clinical studies worldwide, malignancies occurred more frequently in MAVENCLAD-treated patients [10 events in 3,754 patient-years (0.27 events per 100 patient-years)], compared to placebo patients [3 events in 2,275 patient-years (0.13 events per 100 patient-years)]. Malignancy cases in MAVENCLAD patients included metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma (2 cases), ovarian cancer, compared to malignancy cases in placebo patients, all of which were curable by surgical resection [basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ (2 cases)]. The incidence of malignancies in United States MAVENCLAD clinical study patients was higher than the rest of the world [4 events in 189 patient-years (2.21 events per 100 patient-years) compared to 0 events in United States placebo patients]; however, the United States results were based on a limited amount of patient data.

After the completion of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In clinical studies, patients who received additional MAVENCLAD treatment within 2 years after the first 2 treatment courses had an increased incidence of malignancy [7 events in 790 patient-years (0.91 events per 100 patient-years) calculated from the start of cladribine treatment in Year 3]. The risk of malignancy with reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after the completion of 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of MAVENCLAD on an individual patient basis. Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with MAVENCLAD.

2.1 Assessments Prior to Starting Each MAVENCLAD Treatment Course

Cancer Screening

Follow standard cancer screening guidelines because of the risk of malignancies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pregnancy

Exclude pregnancy prior to treatment with MAVENCLAD in females of reproductive potential [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Complete Blood Count (CBC)

Obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Lymphocytes must be:

within normal limits before initiating the first treatment course
at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment course

If necessary, delay the second treatment course for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of lymphocytes to at least 800 cells per microliter. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive further treatment with MAVENCLAD.

Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

Exclude HIV infection.
Perform tuberculosis screening.
Screen for hepatitis B and C.
Evaluate for acute infection. Consider a delay in MAVENCLAD treatment until any acute infection is fully controlled.
Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for VZV is recommended prior to initiation of MAVENCLAD.
Vaccination of patients who are seropositive to VZV is recommended with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted. Patients may be administered zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted at any time prior to or during the year 1 or year 2 course of MAVENCLAD treatment. These patients may also be administered the vaccine if their lymphocyte counts are ≤ 500 cells per microliter.
Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting MAVENCLAD. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting MAVENCLAD.
Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

Liver Injury

Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

WARNING: MALIGNANCIES AND RISK OF TERATOGENICITY

Malignancies

Treatment with MAVENCLAD may increase the risk of malignancy. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of MAVENCLAD on an individual patient basis. Follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with MAVENCLAD [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception because of the potential for fetal harm. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals. Exclude pregnancy before the start of treatment with MAVENCLAD in females of reproductive potential. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Stop MAVENCLAD if the patient becomes pregnant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

WARNING: MALIGNANCIES and RISK OF TERATOGENICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Malignancies

MAVENCLAD may increase the risk of malignancy. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy; evaluate the benefits and risks on an individual basis for patients with prior or increased risk of malignancy. (5.1)

Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception because of the risk of fetal harm. (5.2)

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in pregnant women and in females and males of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of MAVENCLAD in pregnant women. Cladribine was embryolethal when administered to pregnant mice and produced malformations in mice and rabbits [see Data]. The observed developmental effects are consistent with the effects of cladribine on DNA [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

There is a pregnancy safety study that monitors the pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to cladribine. Physicians and patients are encouraged to report pregnancies of women with multiple sclerosis exposed to oral cladribine during pregnancy or within 6 months before conception as well as pregnancies fathered by men with multiple sclerosis who had taken oral cladribine within 6 months before conception by calling EMD Serono's Adverse Event reporting line at 1–800–283–8088 ext. 5563 or by faxing 1–781–681–2961.

Data

Animal Data

When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and malformations (including exencephaly and cleft palate) and embryofetal death were observed at the highest dose tested. An increase in skeletal variations was observed at all but the lowest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity.

When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, fetal growth retardation and a high incidence of craniofacial and limb malformations were observed at the highest dose tested, in the absence of maternal toxicity.

When cladribine was administered intravenously (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/day) to mice throughout pregnancy and lactation, skeletal anomalies and embryolethality were observed at all but the lowest dose tested.

Cladribine

Cladribine is an oral cytolytic agent, which is metabolized and taken up by lymphocytes resulting in selective accumulation of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5' -diphosphate (2-CdATP) due to lack of 5′ nucleotidases in these cells. Incorporation of 2-CdATP into cellular DNA interferes with DNA synthesis and repair leading to cell death. Cladribine is taken orally in two courses a month apart dosed according to weight. After 48 weeks, the dosing cycle is repeated. In a randomized clinical trial, cladribine reduced annualized relapse rates to 0.14 for the approved 3.5 ​mg/kg dose arm compared to 0.33 in placebo treated individuals, reduced new MRI lesion activity, and reduced risk of three month confirmed disability progression by 33 ​%. In an extension trial in participants who were given no additional active therapy, 75 ​% remained relapse free over 2 years. A separate study in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event was terminated by the sponsor before completion, however, it did show a reduction in the number of individuals with subsequent relapse of 13 ​% in the 3.5 ​mg/kg treatment group compared to 34 ​% in the placebo group. In a retrospective observational study of a prospective cohort, cladribine treatment was associated with a lower annualized relapse rate than fingolimod, but a higher rate than natalizumab, alemtuzumab, or ocrelizumab. Risk of disability worsening for cladribine did not differ from fingolimod or alemtuzumab but was higher than natalizumab and ocrelizumab.

Potential adverse effects of cladribine include immune suppression, infections, hepatotoxicity, persistent lymphopenia and teratogenicity. Transfusion associated graft versus host disease has rarely been observed in MS patients who have been treated with cladribine and it is recommended that only irradiated blood be administered to individuals who have been treated with this agent. Cladribine carries a black box warning for malignancy and teratogenicity, and the US FDA considers it generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. It is not recommended for use in clinically isolated syndrome because of its safety profile.

Results and discussion

Three hundred and eighty-four patients affected by classic HCL (including 3 patients with HCL variant) were diagnosed and followed between 1969 and 2018. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 25–85 years). Male patients represented 86.5% of the sample. Splenomegaly was found in 53% of the cases. Median BM cellularity before treatment was 50%, with a median leukemic infiltration of 90%. All patients received cladribine as upfront systemic therapy (12 patients underwent previous splenectomy), either subcutaneously or by IV, according to era- and site-specific guidelines and experience. Most patients were treated in the decade 2000 to 2009 (54%), then between 2010 and 2019 (27%), and between 1990 and 1999 (18%). Before 1990, cladribine was considered experimental in Europe, and only 1% of the patients (5 in total) received it.

The overall response rate (sum of CR and partial response rates) was 94%, ranging between 86% and 100%, according to the experience of the different centers. A CR was obtained in 276 cases (72%), ranging from 54% to 85% (supplemental Table). Two hundred and ninety-three patients (76%) received no more therapy besides the initial course as they did not require further treatment for their disease. Among these patients, 208 (54%) displayed no further relapse or progression over time, within a range of follow-up of 1 to 22 years (median, 8.5 years). A continuous CR, which indicates a hematologic CR maintained for ≥ 5 years, was documented in 76 patients (20%), which corresponds to 28% of all complete responder subjects (supplemental Figure).

NCCN Hairy Cell Leukemia suggested treatment regimens footnotes — All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated, and treatment recommendations apply to histologically confirmed cHCL, not HCLv (ICCC)/SBLPN (WHO5). BRAF inhibitors are highly effective in patients with BRAF V600E-positive HCL, particularly in relapsed/refractory settings or when standard therapies are unsuitable. For infection considerations, standard-dose purine analogs should not be administered to patients with active life-threatening or chronic infection; treat active infection prior to initiating treatment with standard-dose purine analogs, and if it is not possible to control infection, consider initiating treatment with low-dose pentostatin before using standard-dose purine analogs to secure a durable response. Cladribine and pentostatin have not been compared head-to-head in clinical trials, but appear to show comparable therapeutic activity. Rituximab and hyaluronidase human injection for subcutaneous use may be used in patients who have received at least one full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous route, and an FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for rituximab. Anti-CD20 mAbs include: rituximab or obinutuzumab. Selected agents were studied for primary refractory disease and early relapse (1–2 y) after first course of purine analogue, and peginterferon alfa-2a may be substituted for other interferon preparations.

5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during MAVENCLAD dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course.

In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD and prevented by the use of effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with MAVENCLAD should discontinue treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception.

5.3 Lymphopenia

MAVENCLAD causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks.

Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if MAVENCLAD is administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%).

Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with MAVENCLAD. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient's lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections).

### Specific patterns of immune cell dynamics may explain the early onset and prolonged efficacy of cladribine tablets: a MAGNIFY-MS substudy [^114xtuS8]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS for which several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are available to reduce the risk of relapse and worsening disability. Although the pathogenesis of MS is not fully established, numerous immune cell subtypes are believed to play a role in demyelination and neuroaxonal damage. Indeed, MS has been historically associated with T cells, specifically T helper cells. However, more recently there is increasing evidence of the contribution of B cells, microglial cells, and potentially natural killer (NK) cellsin the pathogenesis of MS.

Current generation DMTs for MS include a range of immune depletion and repopulating agents. Such treatments include cladribine tablets 10 mg (MAVENCLAD, the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; 3.5 mg/kg cumulative dose over 2 years), a highly efficacious DMT that is approved for the treatment of MS in > 80 countries worldwide. Evidence suggests that cladribine tablets act as an immune reconstitution therapy, causing a reduction of lymphocytes with predominance in B-cell and T-cell counts followed by reconstitution occurring at different times and rates according to cell subtype. While cladribine tablets selectively reduce adaptive immune cell counts, the effects on the innate immune system are negligible.

Some long-term evaluations of the effect of treatment with cladribine tablets on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subtype dynamics have been completed in previous clinical trials (CLARITY [CLAdRIbine Tablets treating multiple sclerosis orallY], CLARITY Extension, Prospective observational long-term safety registry of multiple sclerosis patients who have parti-cipated in cladribine clinical trials [PREMIERE] and the oral cladribine for early multiple sclerosis trial [ORACLE-MS]). However, the results described only major cell types and effects of cladribine tablets on a range of immune cell subtypes while a deeper immune phenotyping was not determined in these studies.

In this study, as part of an exploratory substudy, our research question concerned PBMC subtype dynamics and immunoglobulin (Ig) levels during the first 12 months after patients had initiated treatment with cladribine tablets for highly active relapsing MS. The substudy was part of MAGNIFY-MS (NCT03364036), which has previously shown significant reductions in active MRI lesions from month 2 (day 60) onward after treatment initiation with cladribine tablets.

Therapeutic sequence management

In managing MS treatment sequences (Statement 8.1), cladribine and anti-CD20 therapies achieved 100% consensus, with most HE DMTs, except for alemtuzumab and natalizumab, receiving positive consensus. Among ME DMTs, only dimethyl fumarate obtained positive consensus, while the others did not. The result for interferons and glatiramer acetate were somewhat surprising in the context of sequencing, as these therapies typically allow for easier transitions to subsequent treatments. This may be attributed to perceptions of lower efficacy, leading to them being avoided from the outset unless specific patient needs justify their use.

The full consensus on the future management of therapeutic sequences underscores the need for a strategic, long-term approach to MS treatment. Managing treatment sequences involves balancing clinical and MRI activity control, safety, and tolerability, reflecting the complexity of MS management. Neurologists must reassess and adjust treatment plans over time, considering both short-term and long-term goals as patient needs evolve. Personal considerations, such as family planning, should be integrated into sequencing decisions to ensure treatments align with patients' life goals and do not hinder personal plans.

Cladribine (Mavenclad)

Oral cladribine is a purine nucleoside analog prodrug, which interferes with cellular metabolism, inhibits DNA synthesis and repair, and induces apoptosis preferentially in lymphocytes. e39 This results in a rapid and persistent reduction in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with a significant effect also on B cells and more minor and transient effects on innate immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells. e39, e40 Lymphopenia (most often mild to moderate) was an expected and common adverse event in both the initial phase III clinical trial and extension study with rare cases of severe neutropenia. One year after the initial dosing of cladribine, ≥ grade 2 lymphopenia (< 800 cells/μL) prohibited the scheduled retreatment in 8%. e41 After both cycles of therapy, median absolute lymphocyte counts recover to normal and CD19 + B cells to threshold values by week 84, although often at levels below baseline values. e42 NK cells are transiently reduced after administration of cladribine. e43 Overall risk of infection with cladribine was comparable to placebo except for higher rates of reactivated herpes virus infections in patients with grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. e44, e45 The incidence of infection was higher in patients with the lowest absolute lymphocyte count. e44, e45 With respect to other infections, there was 1 fatal case of reactivation of latent tuberculosis in a cladribine-treated patient. Given the substantial and sustained effect on lymphocyte count, there is a theoretical concern for increased SARS-CoV-2 infection with oral cladribine, but the real-world experience suggests that infectious risk is low. The published literature presently precludes meaningful comment on the potential effects of cladribine on the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 ARDS.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the clinical trial program of cladribine in MS, 1,976 patients received cladribine for a total of 9,509 patient years. The mean time on study including follow-up was approximately 4.8 years, and approximately 24% of cladribine-treated patients had approximately 8 years of time on study including follow-up. Of these, 923 patients aged 18 to 66 years received MAVENCLAD as monotherapy at a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg per kg.

Table 2 shows adverse reactions in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] with an incidence of at least 5% for MAVENCLAD and higher than placebo. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions reported in Study 1 are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia.

Hypersensitivity

In clinical studies, 11% of MAVENCLAD patients had hypersensitivity adverse reactions, compared to 7% of placebo patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Alopecia

Alopecia occurred in 3% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo patients.

Myelodysplastic Syndrome

Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in patients that had received parenteral cladribine at a higher dosage than that approved for MAVENCLAD. These cases occurred several years after treatment.

Herpes Meningoencephalitis

Fatal herpes meningoencephalitis occurred in one MAVENCLAD-treated patient, at a higher dosage and longer duration of therapy than the approved MAVENCLAD dosage and in combination with interferon beta-1a treatment.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)

SJS and TEN are identified risks of parenteral cladribine for the treatment of oncologic indications.

Seizures

In clinical studies, serious events of seizure occurred in 0.3% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients compared to 0 placebo patients. Serious events included generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus. It is unknown whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to MAVENCLAD, or to a combination of both.

Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) requiring prioritization of the SM component (eg, 1 or more C-findings) is managed with the following algorithm: Preferred regimens are Clinical trial, Avapritinib (if platelets ≥ 50 x 10^9/L), or Midostaurin, and other recommended regimens are Cladribine or Peginterferon alfa-2a ± prednisone; Avapritinib is not recommended for the treatment of patients with platelet counts of less than 50 x 10^9/L. With an adequate response, continue treatment and/or consider evaluation for allogeneic HCT. For progression of AHN, use AHN-directed therapy (including consideration of allogeneic HCT with concurrent management of SM) and see NCCN Guidelines relevant to AHN. For inadequate response or intolerance/no response or loss of response, re-stage, consider subsequent-line therapy and consider allogeneic HCT; for re-staging, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, serum tryptase level, and additional staging studies should be performed as clinically indicated (if supported by increased symptoms and signs of progression). Additional notes state that for patients with advanced SM, cladribine may be useful when rapid debulking of disease is required whereas peginterferon alfa-2a may be more suitable for patients with slowly progressive disease without the need for rapid cytoreduction, and clinical benefit may not reach the threshold of the clinical trial response criteria. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Access and alternatives when approved DMTs are unavailable — DMTs should be available to all people with relapsing forms of MS, and where access is limited DMTs may be obtained with support from the pharmaceutical industry or from organizations, so clinicians may direct people with MS who are candidates for DMTs to support programs (Level C) and clinicians may recommend azathioprine or cladribine for people with relapsing forms of MS who do not have access to approved DMTs (Level C). The rationale notes azathioprine has mixed results and evidence for which confidence is low to support efficacy in relapsing forms of MS and that cladribine has evidence of benefit for both the oral and parenteral formulations, but currently only the parenteral formulations are available.

### Comprehensive systematic review summary: disease-modifying therapies for adults with multiple sclerosis: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116qRfkT]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review evidence on starting, switching, and stopping disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and progressive MS forms.

Methods

Relevant, peer-reviewed research articles, systematic reviews, and abstracts were identified (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE searched from inception to November 2016). Studies were rated using the therapeutic classification scheme. Prior published Cochrane reviews were also used.

Results

Twenty Cochrane reviews and an additional 73 full-text articles were selected for data extraction through an updated systematic review (completed November 2016). For people with RRMS, many DMTs are superior to placebo (annualized relapses rates [ARRs], new disease activity [new MRI T2 lesion burden], and in-study disease progression) (see summary and full text publications). For people with RRMS who experienced a relapse on interferon-β (IFN-β) or glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab is more effective than IFN-β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous 3 times per week in reducing the ARR. For people with primary progressive MS, ocrelizumab is probably more effective than placebo (in-study disease progression). DMTs for MS have varying adverse effects. In people with CIS, glatiramer acetate and IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times per week are more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS. Cladribine, immunoglobulins, IFN-β-1a 30 μg intramuscular weekly, IFN-β-1b subcutaneous alternate day, and teriflunomide are probably more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS. Suggestions for future research include studies considering comparative effectiveness, usefulness of high-efficacy treatment vs stepped-care protocols, and research into predictive biomarkers.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is no experience with overdose of MAVENCLAD. Lymphopenia is known to be dose- dependent. Particularly close monitoring of hematological parameters is recommended in patients who have been exposed to an overdose of MAVENCLAD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5)].

There is no known specific antidote to an overdose of MAVENCLAD. Treatment consists of careful observation and initiation of appropriate supportive measures. Discontinuation of MAVENCLAD may need to be considered. Because of the rapid and extensive intracellular and tissue distribution, hemodialysis is unlikely to eliminate cladribine to a significant extent.

### Comparative effectiveness of cladribine and S1P receptor modulators in treatment-naive relapsing-remitting MS [^111RgnL3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with inflammatory and neurodegenerative components, requiring long-term therapy to control inflammation and delay progression. These processes may start before the first clinical event, highlighting the importance of early treatment.

Early initiation of high-efficacy, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) reduces disability, improves quality of life, and lowers socioeconomic burden. Although treatment has traditionally followed an escalation approach, evidence supports earlier use of high-efficacy agents. Choosing the optimal DMT at diagnosis remains challenging due to prognostic uncertainty, differences in efficacy and safety, lack of head-to-head data, and constraints from guidelines and reimbursement policies.

Among oral DMTs for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PRMs), and cladribine tablets, show higher efficacy than placebo and lower-efficacy agents, but in many health care systems, including the European Union, their use is largely limited to patients for whom prior therapies failed or those with highly active disease. Empirical evidence suggests that early use of cladribine or S1PRMs, either first-line or early in the disease, may provide greater benefit than delayed initiation, with lower switching rates in treatment-naive patients with RRMS. Some observational studies indicate cladribine may yield better persistence and lower relapse rates than fingolimod, while others report comparable outcomes. One analysis found cladribine superior for disability improvement. Comparative data with ozanimod and ponesimod, especially in treatment-naive patients with RRMS, are lacking.

To address this gap, we assessed the effectiveness of cladribine vs S1PRMs specifically in patients with treatment-naive RRMS, using the Italian Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders Register. A propensity score (PS)–matched design compared relapse risk, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, and disability progression, aiming to inform early therapeutic strategies.

5.4 Infections

Serious, including life-threatening or fatal, bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections have been reported in patients receiving MAVENCLAD. MAVENCLAD reduces the body's immune defense, and an increased risk of infections has been observed in patients receiving MAVENCLAD.

Infections occurred in 49% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients compared to 44% of placebo patients in clinical studies; serious or severe infections occurred in 2.4% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients and 2.0% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent serious infections in MAVENCLAD-treated patients included herpes zoster and pyelonephritis (see Herpes Virus Infections). Fungal infections were observed, including cases of coccidioidomycosis.

In the postmarketing setting, serious infections have been reported, including nocardiosis, varicella zoster, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. The majority of patients with these infections who had an available absolute lymphocyte count at the time of the event had concurrent lymphopenia, consistent with the mechanism of action of MAVENCLAD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

HIV infection, active tuberculosis, and active hepatitis must be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD [see Contraindications (4)].

Delay initiation of MAVENCLAD in patients with an acute infection until the infection is fully resolved or controlled.

Initiation of MAVENCLAD in patients currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Concomitant use of MAVENCLAD with these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression.

Tuberculosis

Three of 1,976 (0.2%) cladribine-treated patients in the clinical program developed tuberculosis. All three cases occurred in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. One case of tuberculosis was fatal, and two cases resolved with treatment.

Perform tuberculosis screening prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of MAVENCLAD. Latent tuberculosis infections may be activated with use of MAVENCLAD. In patients with tuberculosis infection, delay initiation of MAVENCLAD until the infection has been adequately treated.

### Managing MS in a changing treatment landscape [^113aNyHu]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Increasing options are dictating the development of new algorithms to provide guidance in the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). There is a wealth of evidence on the safety and efficacy of interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate, which have been used in Europe and in the United States for more than 10 years. The spectrum of approved indications for these conventional disease modifying therapies includes the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, and the clinically isolated syndrome. Beyond these therapies we already have the recently introduced antibody natalizumab and, in some countries, the immunosuppressive agent mitoxantrone. Oral therapies are expected in the near future, with the sphingosin-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod approved in the US and the EU and the purine nucleoside analogue cladribine in Australia and Russia. The evidence on all of these conventional and novel therapeutics is reviewed in this paper to provide an overview of the changing landscape of MS treatment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^115dcy9D]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Cytoreductive therapy options — advanced systemic mastocytosis options include avapritinib, midostaurin, cladribine, or peginterferon alfa-2a, with specific use constraints and cautions. Peginterferon alfa-2a is an option for ASM and SM-AHN when the SM component requires prioritization over the AHN component but is not recommended for MCL with or without an AHN. Cladribine or peginterferon alfa-2a may also be useful in select symptomatic ISM or SSM with severe, refractory symptoms related to mast cell mediator release or bone disease not responsive to anti-mediator drug therapy or bisphosphonates. Given potential toxicities with cladribine, including drug-related myelosuppression and infections, the risks and potential benefits need to be weighed in this non-advanced SM population. In SM-AHN, an initial assessment is undertaken to determine whether the SM component or the AHN component requires prioritization.

Cytoreductive therapy — Regimen categories and options: In the NCCN Guidelines, regimens for cytoreductive therapy are stratified into three categories — preferred regimens, other recommended regimens, and useful in certain circumstances. For symptomatic indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) or smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM), anti-mediator drug therapy is recommended; enrollment in a clinical trial is a preferred option, and avapritinib (if platelet counts are ≥ 50 x 10^9/L) is also a preferred option. For symptomatic ISM or SSM, cladribine or peginterferon alfa-2a may be useful in certain circumstances for select patients with severe, refractory mediator symptoms or bone disease not responsive to anti-mediator therapy or bisphosphonates. For advanced disease, enrollment in a clinical trial, avapritinib (if platelet counts are ≥ 50 x 10^9/L), and midostaurin are preferred regimens and cladribine and peginterferon alfa-2a are other recommended regimens for patients with ASM, SM-AHN (when the SM component requires prioritization over the AHN component), and MCL (with or without AHN) (except for peginterferon alfa-2a ± prednisone). Imatinib is included as a useful in certain circumstances treatment option for rare patients with ASM defined on the page.

The combination of cladribine with rituximab decreases the MRD positivity rate versus cladribine monotherapy in first-line therapy. Rituximab, however, has an additional immunosuppressive effect. While the combination of cladribine and rituximab is often used for cHCL patients in relapse, there has been a trend to use them as initial induction in an effort to reduce the extent of residual disease. Considering the potential contribution of rituximab to further impairment in immunity and its ability to decrease the effectiveness of subsequent immunization for many months, some hematologists are re-considering the risk–benefit assessment of using this combination of a purine analog and a monoclonal antibody at this time in the midst of a pandemic. An additional challenge is the treatment of cHCL patients with active infection and a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In these patients with the current extent of the pandemic, alternatives to nucleoside analogs are being considered:

### Effects of cladribine on intrathecal and peripheral B and plasma cells [^112wvzF4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We used SClad, rather than the oral formulation (Mavenclad®) licensed for pwMS. However, we and others before us have shown that the two formulations are pharmacodynamically very similar. The dose of the licensed oral formulation was modelled on parenteral cladribine data. Likewise, the dosing schedule of CLADRIPLAS was based on the pivotal CLARITY study, including allowance for the enhanced bioavailability of subcutaneous cladribine. We therefore expect that the information shown in this study, which shows that the influences on plasma cells are much more limited than on memory B cells, applies to the licensed formulation. Indeed, consistent biology is emerging in relation to the effects on therapy, immunodepletion of cell subsets, and also vaccination and OCB responses. There was a machine switch/lab switch during the study related to flow cytometry, as described earlier; however, this was not a major focus of the current study and changes in B cell levels conformed with that seen in other studies. Importantly, the intended number of pwMS eligible for treatment was not achieved. The small number of people recruited to the treatment arm in CLADRIPLAS was in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our conclusions are supported by the recently completed CLAD-B study.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

No case of PML has been reported in clinical studies of cladribine in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients treated with parenteral cladribine for oncologic indications, cases of PML have been reported in the postmarketing setting.

Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initiating the first treatment course of MAVENCLAD. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold MAVENCLAD and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms.

Vaccinations

Administer all immunizations (except as noted for VZV) according to immunization guidelines prior to starting MAVENCLAD. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting MAVENCLAD, because of a risk of active vaccine infection (see Herpes Virus Infections). Avoid vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines during and after MAVENCLAD treatment while the patient's white blood cell counts are not within normal limits.

### Current and emerging disease-modulatory therapies and treatment targets for multiple sclerosis [^113s7oJN]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Anti‐CD52 monoclonals

Both subsets of T and B cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS, providing a rational for therapeutic targeting. The CD52 antigen, targeted by the monoclonal alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), is present on a variety of immune cells, including memory T and B cells [93]. In the Care‐MS I and II trials, an induction cycle of five repeated infusions of 12 mg alemtuzumab at baseline followed by three infusions after one year was compared with continuous subcutaneous IFN‐β‐1a over two years, showing a 54% and 50% reduction in ARR, respectively [94, 95]. A minority of patients required an additional treatment cycle due to continued disease activity, and long‐term follow‐up of the Care‐MS cohorts has shown long‐term durability of treatment effects, including low brain atrophy rates [96, 97]. Unfortunately, important safety concerns have arisen, which include a high rate of non‐MS autoimmune conditions, composed mostly thyroid disorders, as well as acute infusion‐related cardiovascular events [98, 99]. Given the need for careful patient selection in order to maintain an acceptable benefit‐risk, the label for alemtuzumab has recently been revised (Table 1). A modified anti‐CD52 monoclonal, GZ402668, has undergone early testing in MS with the objective to reduce infusion‐related reactions (NCT02977533).

Cladribine

An alternative induction type of DMT is cladribine (Mavenclad), a purine antimetabolite with selectivity for lymphocytes lacking a rescue pathway for purine synthesis. A phase III trial in RRMS showed that a body weight‐adjusted dose cycle of oral 3.5 mg tablets given at baseline and after one year reduced ARR with 58% compared with placebo [100]. In a second trial, cladribine significantly reduced the risk of conversion to definite MS in patients with CIS compared with placebo [101]. Adverse events include lymphopenia and herpes reactivation, but there was also an imbalance in the number of detected malignancies, however, not exceeding the expected rate during long‐term follow‐up [102]. In the EU, Mavenclad is indicated for patients with highly active RRMS, whilst the US label recommends it to be used in patients with an inadequate response to a prior DMT (Table 1).

### Cladribine tablets added to IFN-β in active relapsing MS: the ONWARD study [^1136ZnXW]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Primary research question: what are the effects of adding cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg to IFN-β in patients still experiencing active relapsing MS despite IFN-β treatment? This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with active relapsing MS despite IFN-β treatment, cladribine tablets added to IFN-β reduced relapses and MRI lesion activity over 96 weeks and increased the incidence of lymphopenia. Patients treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg/IFN-β were 63% less likely to have a qualifying relapse than placebo/IFN-β recipients (relative risk [95% CI] 0.37 [0.22–0.63], p = 0.001). The cladribine 3.5 mg/kg/IFN-β group was 90% less likely to have a new T1 Gd+ lesion (relative risk 0.10 [0.03–0.37], p < 0.001). There was an increased incidence of lymphopenia reported as an AE for cladribine/IFN-β recipients (40.3% vs 0% of placebo/IFN-β recipients).

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents

ONWARD (NCT00436826) was a 96-week, randomized, double-blind, phase IIb study conducted between November 2006 and March 2012 at 50 centers: United States (25 sites), Russia (10), Spain (9), and Italy (6). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and local regulations.

### Expert consensus opinion on the management of hairy cell leukemia in elderly patients [^111Ydxko]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in elderly patients is becoming increasingly important as more patients are diagnosed at advanced ages (≥ 75years) due to longer life expectancy. This expert consensus, based on a survey of international specialists from the Hairy Cell Leukemia Consortium, explores management strategies for this age group. Cladribine monotherapy remains the preferred first-line treatment, but its application varies, with dosage adjustments common to improve tolerability. Experts stress a holistic approach that considers advanced age, comorbidities, and individual patient circumstances. Although functional status and comorbidities are routinely assessed, structured frailty tools are rarely used. For relapsed cases, targeted therapies, including BRAF inhibitors with anti-CD20 antibodies, are favored. Challenges include managing comorbidities, infection risks, and a lack of geriatric-specific evidence. While current treatments are effective, the findings highlight the critical need for data exclusively derived from elderly HCL patients to develop tailored guidelines and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Cladribine [^1147CLKU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first 4 to 8 weeks post-treatment, is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., infection or bleeding). As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Fever was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study. Since the majority of fevers occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated. Although 69% of patients developed fevers, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented infection. Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active infections (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Development of acute renal insufficiency in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described. Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic insufficiency (see WARNINGS).

Rare cases of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden.

Cladribine injection must be diluted in designated intravenous solutions prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Laboratory Tests

During and following treatment, the patient's hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 × 109/L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1500 × 106/L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8. After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine. Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies. Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

A 2-year Prospective Study to Evaluate the Onset of Action of Mavenclad in Subjects With Highly Active Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIFY-MS) (NCT03364036) was a 2-year, phase IV, open-label, single-arm study in which eligible patients are scheduled to receive cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg cumulative dose over 2 years (eFigure 1). Patients receive 2 weeks of active treatment per course (week 1 and week 5 of each year), the start of the first week of treatment in year 1 being considered baseline.

Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤ 5 and a diagnosis of highly active relapsing MS were enrolled between May 28, 2018, and April 23, 2019. In this study, highly active relapsing MS was defined as 1 relapse in the previous year and ≥ 1 T1 gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesion or ≥ 9 T2 lesions while on treatment with another DMT or ≥ 2 relapses in the previous year whether on DMT or not.

Patients were excluded if they had previous exposure to DMT (fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, or ocrelizumab); a lymphocyte count not within normal laboratory limits; presence of signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; tested positive for HIV, hepatitis B or C, or active/latent tuberculosis; had an active malignancy or had an allergy or hypersensitivity to gadolinium; and/or any other contraindication to perform MRI.

### Early and unrestricted access to high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies: a consensus to optimize benefits for people living with multiple sclerosis [^114H7Qqq]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex chronic disease characterized by inflammation, neurodegeneration and inevitable progression, is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) among young adults. Approximately 85% of people living with MS (PLwMS) are diagnosed with relapsing MS (RMS), which includes relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) that may later turn to secondary progressive MS. MS may be seen as a dynamic continuum of phenotypic phases, with each phase being linked to a change in disability worsening that could result from poorly recovered relapses and progression.

According to the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and European Academy of Neurology (EAN) guidelines, MS disease management aims to reduce the risk of relapses and potentially disability progression; however, no curative treatment is available to date. Currently available disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are commonly distinguished as moderate-efficacy (ME) DMTs (interferon-beta [IFNβ], glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) and high-efficacy (HE) DMTs (alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, siponimod and the newly approved ozanimod and ofatumumab).

### The treatment of hairy cell leukemia with a focus on long lasting responses to cladribine: a 30-year experience [^111zdAgF]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has considerably changed over years. Purine analogues, namely cladribine, now represent the treatment of choice. One hundred and eighty-four patients were followed between 1986 and 2018 and treated according to era-specific guidelines. Responses were classified by combining Consensus Resolution criteria and marrow immunohistochemistry. Patients were grouped according to the number of treatment lines they received. Patients treated first line responded in 86% of cases, with complete response (CR) in 44% of cases. Response rates remained high throughout the first four lines (84%, 81%, 79% for the second line onward, with CR in 38%, 37%, 15% of cases respectively). One hundred and twenty-two patients received cladribine as first line treatment, with a response rate of 86% and a CR rate of 54%. Among the 66 CR patients, 45 (68%) have never received further therapy: 11 patients are in continuous CR between 5 and 10years after treatment, 14 between 10 and 20years and three patients at more than 20years. Median time-to-next treatment (TTNT) for frontline cladribine-treated patients was 8.2years: partial responders had a significantly shorter median TTNT than CR patients (5.3years vs median not reached at 25.8years, p < 0.001). Patients with HCL require subsequent lines of therapy in more than 50% of cases. Purine analogues allow significant response rates when applied first line and upon retreatment. Some patients may enjoy long lasting treatment-free intervals after one course of cladribine.

### Practical recommendations on treatment of multiple sclerosis with cladribine: an Israeli experts group ‏ viewpoint [^112c7EuY]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cladribine tablets (Mavenclad ®) were approved by the European Union in 2017 as high-efficacy therapy for highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In Israel, Mavenclad ® was approved in 2018. Real-life experience has confirmed the efficacy of cladribine tablets over at least 4 years from the initial course. During the last years, several questions were raised concerning the management of people with MS who show disease activity during years 3 and 4 post-cladribine initiation and what treatment decisions are needed beyond year 4. A few expert boards have tried to provide insight based on research data and to suggest recommendations on the therapeutic dilemmas and treatment decisions with cladribine. However, there is currently no widely accepted consensus about these issues. The vast clinical experience gained in Israel in the past 5 years in several MS centers across the country allows for a broad perspective of the outcomes with long-term cladribine use. This article summarizes previously published recent recommendations and describes the insights of Israeli neurology key opinion leaders that convened for an advisory board meeting on January 29th, 2023, with the aim of reaching a consensus regarding cladribine long-term treatment and follow-up.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Cladribine (Mavenclad) [^114a3Txr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Additional outcome measures included the proportion of patients with confirmed disability progression, the time to first qualifying relapse, the mean number of MRI T1 Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, and new or enlarging MRI T2 hyperintense lesions. Disability progression was measured in terms of a 3-month sustained change in EDSS score of at least one point, if baseline EDSS score was between 0.5 and 4.5 inclusively, or at least 1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was at least 5, over a period of at least 3 months.

MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg significantly lowered the annualized relapse rate. The results from Study 1 are presented in Table 4.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in breastfeeding women because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Advise women not to breastfeed during dosing with MAVENCLAD and for 10 days after the last dose.

There are no data on the presence of cladribine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before the initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Contraception

Females

Females of reproductive potential should prevent pregnancy by use of effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during MAVENCLAD therapy should discontinue treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Males

As cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on human gametogenesis could be expected. Therefore, male patients of reproductive potential should take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their partner during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients (below 18 years of age) have not been established. Use of MAVENCLAD is not recommended in pediatric patients because of the risk of malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies with MAVENCLAD did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Caution is recommended when MAVENCLAD is used in elderly patients, taking into account the potential greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, concomitant diseases, and other drug therapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^111jidXu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — mast cell leukemia ± associated hematologic neoplasm: initial management and treatment options include referral to specialized centers, patient counseling, trigger avoidance, anaphylaxis preparedness, and defined regimens. Referral to specialized centers with expertise in mastocytosis is strongly recommended, and patients should be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of disease while avoiding known triggers of mast cell activation; patients should carry injectable epinephrine (2 auto injectors) to manage anaphylaxis. Preferred regimens are: Clinical trial or Avapritinib (if platelets ≥ 50 x 10^9/L) or Midostaurin; other recommended regimens are Cladribine or AML-based therapy with consideration of cladribine or midostaurin in regimen. Avapritinib is not recommended for the treatment of patients with platelet counts of less than 50 x 10^9/L. Patients with chronic MCL have no organ damage; however, treatment should be considered given the poor prognosis of MCL. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of MAVENCLAD was demonstrated in a 96-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing forms of MS (Study 1; NCT00213135).

Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median age was 39 years (range 18 to 65) and the female-to-male ratio was approximately 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study enrollment was 8.7 years, and the median baseline neurological disability based on Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score across all treatment groups was 3.0. Over two thirds of the study patients were treatment-naive for drugs used to treat relapsing forms of MS.

1,326 patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dosage of MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg per kg body weight (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. Patients randomized to the 3.5 mg per kg cumulative dose received a first treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the first year and a second treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the second year [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Patients randomized to the 5.25 mg per kg cumulative dose received additional treatment at Weeks 9 and 13 of the first year. Higher cumulative doses did not add any clinically meaningful benefit, but were associated with a higher incidence in grade 3 lymphopenia or higher (44.9% in the 5.25 mg per kg group vs. 25.6% in the 3.5 mg per kg group). Ninety-two percent of patients treated with MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg and 87% of patients receiving placebo completed the full 96 weeks of the study.

Hepatitis

One clinical study patient died from fulminant hepatitis B infection. Perform screening for hepatitis B and C prior to initiation of the first and second treatment course of MAVENCLAD. Latent hepatitis infections may be activated with use of MAVENCLAD. Patients who are carriers of hepatitis B or C virus may be at risk of irreversible liver damage caused by virus reactivation. In patients with hepatitis infection, delay initiation of MAVENCLAD until the infection has been adequately treated.

Herpes Virus Infections

In controlled clinical studies, 6% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients developed a herpes viral infection compared to 2% of placebo patients. The most frequent types of herpes viral infections were herpes zoster infections (2.0% vs. 0.2%) and oral herpes (2.6% vs. 1.2%). Serious herpes zoster infections occurred in 0.2% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients.

Vaccination of patients who are seronegative for varicella zoster virus is recommended prior to initiation of MAVENCLAD. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting MAVENCLAD. Vaccination with zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted is recommended for patients who are seropositive to VZV, either prior to or during MAVENCLAD treatment, including when their lymphocyte counts are less than or equal to 500 cells per microliter.

The incidence of herpes zoster was higher during the period of absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells per microliter, compared to the time when the patients were not experiencing this degree of lymphopenia. Administer anti-herpes prophylaxis in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells per microliter.

Patients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells per microliter should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of infections, including herpes infections. If such signs and symptoms occur, initiate treatment as clinically indicated. Consider interruption or delay of MAVENCLAD until resolution of the infection.

### Therapeutic choices and disease activity after 2 years of treatment with cladribine: an Italian multicenter study (cladStop) [^116tgNj7]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a radical change in the therapeutic scenario of multiple sclerosis (MS). The new knowledge of the disease has enabled the development of new disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs), with different mechanisms of action, greater efficacy, and different safety and tolerability conditions. The current generation of DMTs include a wide range of immune modulators, immune depletion, and repopulating agents.

Such treatment comprises cladribine tablets, a small purine analogue antimetabolite that mimics adenosine, inhibits the action of the adenosine deaminase enzyme, and causes an interim reduction of lymphocytes with predominance in B cell and T cell counts followed by reconstitution of adaptive functions.

In 2017, cladribine was licensed by the European Medicines Agency as the first oral pulsed therapy for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing MS.

Each tablet contains 10 mg cladribine, and the recommended total dose is 3.5 mg/kg body weight administered through two short courses at the beginning of the first and second year. Following completion of the two courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in years 3 and 4, but it is not contraindicated (summaries of product characteristics (SmPCs) Mavenclad April 2022). During the clinical trials, repeating the dose routinely beyond year 2 was not associated with significantly improved disease control (SmPCs Mavenclad April 2022).

This treatment‐free window offers different opportunities compared to continuous therapy regimens, such as patients' flexibility in family planning and attenuating or active vaccine administration, albeit real‐world data confirm a normal humoral and cell‐mediated immune response to vaccination following cladribine treatment regardless of the time of application and the lymphocyte count.

### Cladribine plus rituximab is an effective therapy for newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma [^116RhXua]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2011). Low credibility.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is incurable with standard chemotherapy. There is no consensus on the best initial therapy, especially for elderly patients, who are not candidates for aggressive treatment approaches. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines include rituximab (R) plus cladribine for the initial treatment of MCL. However, few data are available to substantiate this recommendation. Therefore, to further define the role of R-cladribine for the initial treatment of MCL, we performed a retrospective chart review of 31 patients with MCL (median age, 67) treated with R-cladribine. The majority of responding patients also received R maintenance. The overall response rate was 87%, with 61% of patients achieving a complete remission (CR/CRu). The estimated median follow-up was 32.5 months, median PFS was 37.5 months, and median OS was 85.2 months. One of 19 (5.3%) subjects in CR/CRu relapsed (median follow-up of 23 months). CR/CRu was associated with improved survival (p < 0.0001), while a high mantle cell international prognostic index (MIPI) was associated with worse survival (p = 0.05). There was one toxic death (neutropenic pseudomonal sepsis) related to treatment. R-cladribine is an effective therapy for previously untreated MCL, and these results validate the use of R-cladribine for the initial treatment of MCL.

With cladribine as initial therapy, relapse occurred in 37% of responders with a median time to relapse of 42 months; among relapsed patients retreated with cladribine, the CR rate after first relapse was 75% (median response duration 35 months) and after subsequent relapse was 60% (median response duration 20 months). Retreatment with the same purine analog may yield a reasonable duration of disease control in patients with relapsed HCL after an initial durable remission to purine analog therapy.

5.7 Liver Injury

Mavenclad can cause liver injury. In clinical studies, 0.3% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients had liver injury (serious or causing treatment discontinuation) considered related to treatment, compared to 0 placebo patients. Onset ranged from a few weeks to several months after initiation of treatment with MAVENCLAD. Signs and symptoms of liver injury, including elevation of serum aminotransferases to greater than 20-fold the upper limit of normal, were observed. These abnormalities resolved upon treatment discontinuation.

Clinically significant and life-threatening liver injury has been reported in patients treated with MAVENCLAD in the postmarketing setting. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and patients taking other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for developing liver injury when taking MAVENCLAD. Most reported cases of liver injury associated with MAVENCLAD occurred approximately 30 days after initiation (i.e., course 1, cycle 1) of treatment.

MAVENCLAD is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 6) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to each treatment cycle and course [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If a patient develops clinical signs, including unexplained liver enzyme elevations, or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with MAVENCLAD, as appropriate.

5.8 Hypersensitivity

In clinical studies, 11% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients had hypersensitivity reactions, compared to 7% of placebo patients. Hypersensitivity reactions that were serious and/or led to discontinuation of MAVENCLAD (e.g., dermatitis, pruritus) occurred in 0.5% of 13 MAVENCLAD-treated patients, compared to 0.1% of placebo patients. One patient had a serious hypersensitivity reaction with rash, mucous membrane ulceration, throat swelling, vertigo, diplopia, and headache after the first dose of MAVENCLAD.

If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue MAVENCLAD therapy. Do not use MAVENCLAD in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cladribine [see Contraindications (4)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been fully elucidated but is thought to involve cytotoxic effects on B and T lymphocytes through impairment of DNA synthesis, resulting in depletion of lymphocytes.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

MAVENCLAD causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment cycle and were lower with each additional treatment cycle. At the end of Year 2, 2% of patients continued to have absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter. The median time to recovery from lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Cladribine is a prodrug that becomes active upon phosphorylation to its 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd-ATP) metabolite.

The pharmacokinetic parameters presented below were assessed following oral administration of cladribine 10 mg, unless otherwise specified. The cladribine mean maximum concentration (Cmax) was in the range of 22 to 29 ng/ mL and corresponding mean AUC was in the range of 80 to 101 ng∙h/mL.

The Cmaxand AUC of cladribine increased proportionally across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg.

No accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma was observed after repeated dosing.

Absorption

The bioavailability of cladribine was approximately 40%. Following fasted administration of cladribine, the median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was 0.5 h (range 0.5 to 1.5 hours).

Effect of Food

Following administration of cladribine with a high fat meal, the geometric mean Cmax decreased by 29% and AUC was unchanged. The Tmaxwas prolonged to 1.5 hours (range 1 to 3 hours). This difference is not expected to be clinically significant.

Distribution

Cladribine mean apparent volume of distribution ranges from 480 to 490 liters. The plasma protein binding of cladribine is 20% and is independent of concentration, in vitro.

Intracellular concentrations of cladribine and/or its metabolites in human lymphocytes were approximately 30 to 40 times extracellular, in vitro.

Cladribine has the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A cerebrospinal fluid/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.25 was observed in cancer patients.

### Hairy cell leukemia and COVID-19 adaptation of treatment guidelines [^114FLBaS]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of a BRAF inhibitor either with a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody or a MEK inhibitor can further increase the rate of durable remissions without inducing severe myelosuppression. Therefore, selection of the optimal induction therapy for the newly diagnosed patient should consider these "off-label" options that may avoid excessive myelosuppression during the current pandemic. It may also be prudent to avoid the use of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody during this time as well if the patient is scheduled to be soon vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (see section on prevention) or if the benefit of adding rituximab in terms of depth and rapidity of response is offset by the perceived risk of rituximab-induced immune suppression.

Newly diagnosed cHCL — choice of treatment

Primary treatment over the past two decades includes either cladribine or pentostatin. Both nucleoside analogs are effective and may induce long-term complete remissions. Purine nucleosides have been the established approved therapy for cHCL either as front-line therapy or for those in relapse. Their use has resulted in marked improvement in survival in patients with HCL, but both agents are very immunosuppressive. Different schedules have been proposed for cladribine. The administration on 5 consecutive days of cladribine is frequently used as highly effective induction, but is myelosuppressive. Other schedules have been explored in an effort to reduce myelosuppression, but have been equivalent with respect to infectious complications. Pentostatin can also be myelosuppressive, but the schedule of administration enables dose titration to reduce the depth and length of myelosuppression. Both cladribine and pentostatin cause serious and prolonged immunosuppression and their use requires careful consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic.
