## Question

management of ulcerative colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management framework for ulcerative colitis, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about disease classification and risk stratification. Then, I should verify treat-to-target goals and monitoring cadence. Next, I will examine induction strategies by severity, including mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe disease, and I must not forget acute severe UC. After that, I should review maintenance therapy and de-escalation principles. I will then consider special populations and extraintestinal manifestations, followed by surgical indications and perioperative planning. Finally, I need to integrate emerging therapies, adherence strategies, and a concise algorithm summary, while double-checking areas of controversy and evidence strength throughout [^113Ueo4a] [^1133EkY5].

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification and risk stratification elements because everything downstream depends on them. I need to check extent (proctitis, left-sided, extensive/pancolitis), activity (clinical remission, mild, moderate, severe, fulminant), and prognostic features such as early age of onset, deep ulcers, steroid dependence, prior hospitalizations, and elevated biomarkers, since these factors guide intensity of therapy and urgency of escalation [^113Ueo4a] [^112uueFa]. Hold on, I should verify biomarker thresholds; fecal calprotectin greater than 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP increase the likelihood of endoscopic inflammation and help refine risk, though they are not perfect surrogates for mucosal healing and should be integrated with symptoms and endoscopy when discordant [^113tUnNy] [^116NnRQW].

> Next, I should review treat-to-target goals and monitoring cadence, and I need to ensure I am precise about targets and timelines. Deep remission, defined as both symptomatic remission and endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic score 0–1), is the preferred target because it associates with sustained steroid-free remission and reduced colectomy risk; histologic remission is desirable but not yet a validated primary target in guidelines, so I should be cautious not to overstate it as mandatory [^1133EkY5] [^115FP6i9]. Wait, let me verify monitoring intervals; in remission, biomarker checks every 6–12 months plus annual clinical review are reasonable, whereas active disease warrants tighter intervals and endoscopic reassessment at 3–6 months to confirm response and guide escalation [^114xNeJg].

> For mild-to-moderate disease, I will now examine induction with 5-ASA, and I should double-check dosing and formulation nuances. Oral mesalamine at 2–4.8 g/day combined with rectal therapy (enema or suppository) is superior to oral alone for left-sided or extensive disease, and rectal 5-ASA is preferred over rectal steroids for distal disease; adherence is improved with once-daily dosing when feasible, and if appropriately dosed 5-ASA fails, switching to another 5-ASA formulation is not advised — escalate class instead [^114czpzQ] [^1171KUFN] [^1169438b] [^111mU1Eg]. Hold on, I should verify steroid positioning; budesonide MMX or rectal steroids can be used short-term for induction if 5-ASA is inadequate, but systemic steroids should be avoided for maintenance given risks and lack of sustained benefit [^113SepQY] [^113Ueo4a].

> For moderate-to-severe disease, I need to ensure I do not delay effective therapy, and I should confirm the stance on early advanced therapy. Guidelines suggest early use of advanced therapies (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, JAK inhibitors) rather than prolonged step-up after 5-ASA failure, especially in high-risk patients, with infliximab often preferred for rapid onset and inpatient utility; combination with an immunomodulator can improve durability, though evidence varies by agent and context [^114BBWTb] [^114j9hV6] [^111NdPeT] [^116sLxn2]. Wait, let me verify combination specifics; for TNF antagonists, combination with thiopurine or methotrexate is favored over monotherapy in many settings, whereas for non-TNF biologics, evidence for routine combination is insufficient, so I should individualize and avoid blanket rules [^116sLxn2] [^114qUqBM] [^1136EWqE].

> I should confirm steroid strategy in moderate-to-severe flares and avoid implying maintenance roles. Oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day is standard for induction with a planned taper once remission is achieved, and I must emphasize that steroids are not maintenance agents; repeated or prolonged courses increase harm without durable benefit, reinforcing the need for steroid-sparing maintenance from the outset [^111qCkN8] [^113Ueo4a]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk for infections or malignancy? In that case, vedolizumab or anti-IL-23 strategies may be preferable due to more favorable systemic immunosuppression profiles, which I should discuss during shared decision-making [^111NdPeT].

> Now, acute severe UC requires a different tempo and multidisciplinary coordination, and I need to ensure I get the sequence right. Hospitalize, correct fluids/electrolytes, obtain C. difficile and pathogen testing, and start IV corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours or methylprednisolone 60 mg/day); reassess rigorously at 3–5 days, and if there is no meaningful improvement, escalate to rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine, with early surgical consultation in parallel to avoid delays if rescue fails [^116C6zk4] [^115wyyvy] [^116FhLee]. Hold on, I should verify rescue choices; both infliximab and cyclosporine are acceptable, but infliximab is often favored for dosing flexibility and post-induction maintenance options, while cyclosporine requires close drug level monitoring and transition to thiopurine or vedolizumab maintenance to mitigate relapse risk [^116FhLee] [^116VevPQ].

> Next, I should review maintenance therapy and de-escalation, and I need to check which combinations to continue and which to simplify. In general, the drug that achieved induction should be continued for maintenance; for example, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or anti-TNF responders should remain on that agent, with TNF-based combination therapy favored over monotherapy in selected patients to reduce immunogenicity and loss of response, though I must balance infection risk and patient preference [^113j97zC] [^116N263f] [^1165KVxg] [^112n7AEp]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said thiopurine monotherapy is fine for moderate-to-severe maintenance; I should correct that — guidelines advise against thiopurine or methotrexate monotherapy for maintenance in moderate-to-severe UC, reserving thiopurines for milder disease or as part of combination strategies when appropriate [^111qEnHx] [^114aJBuT]. I also need to ensure 5-ASA is discontinued after escalation to advanced therapies in moderate-to-severe disease, as it adds little and may complicate adherence, and when de-escalating a successful TNF plus immunomodulator combination, stopping the TNF rather than the immunomodulator may better preserve remission in some contexts [^115dEkV5] [^115APQVn] [^114d1Coj].

> I will now examine special populations and extraintestinal manifestations, and I should confirm where evidence is strong versus limited. In pregnancy, prefer 5-ASA maintenance, avoid methotrexate, and use biologics such as TNF inhibitors or vedolizumab when disease control is necessary, with shared decision-making given evolving but generally reassuring safety data; in pediatrics, treat-to-target with early effective therapy is emphasized, and growth and bone health must be monitored closely [^1143SdgU]. For extraintestinal manifestations, I need to check which therapies have dual efficacy; TNF inhibitors benefit arthropathy and certain skin manifestations, whereas vedolizumab is gut-selective and may be less effective for systemic EIMs, which should influence agent selection when EIMs are prominent [^notfound].

> Surgical indications and perioperative planning require careful timing and multidisciplinary input, and I should double-check staging recommendations. Medically refractory disease, dysplasia or cancer, and acute severe UC failing rescue therapy are key indications for colectomy; in the biologic era, a three-stage IPAA (total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy, then IPAA, then ileostomy closure) is typically preferred to minimize morbidity, and preoperative biologic exposure is generally safe but should be integrated into timing and infection risk mitigation plans [^115VKQna] [^1148GkUn] [^112ye89e]. Hold on, I should verify the acute severe timeline; an initial 7-day window of intensive medical therapy with readiness for colectomy if no response is a pragmatic approach to balance rescue opportunity with safety [^115xtQJY].

> Emerging therapies and strategies are evolving, and I need to ensure I separate proven from investigational. JAK inhibitors such as upadacitinib are recommended in BSG 2025 for induction and maintenance in moderate-to-severe UC, and dual-targeted therapy is an attractive concept for refractory disease, though robust prospective data are limited and patient selection is key; fecal microbiota transplantation shows signals in mild-to-moderate UC but remains investigational outside trials pending standardized protocols and durability data [^116WdNv5] [^114MrCv8] [^116RXzs4] [^116rXHry]. Let me reconsider the therapeutic ceiling; with remission rates often 20–30% in induction trials, combination strategies, earlier effective therapy, and treat-to-target monitoring are pragmatic ways to push beyond apparent plateaus while we await next-generation mechanisms [^112zfQ79].

> I should confirm adherence and lifestyle strategies because nonadherence undermines even the best regimens. Once-daily 5-ASA formulations, clear taper plans, and education on early recognition of flares improve adherence; screening for anxiety and depression and addressing nutrition, bone health, and vaccination needs are integral to comprehensive care and should be embedded in routine follow-up [^1169438b] [^1133EkY5] [^116x83uH]. Wait, let me verify that we also emphasize shared decision-making around testing burden and biomarker use; patients valuing convenience may reasonably choose symptom-based monitoring in some contexts, which I should acknowledge to align care with preferences [^116NnRQW].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise algorithm and double-check internal consistency. Classify extent and severity, stratify risk, and select induction accordingly: mild-to-moderate disease starts with optimized 5-ASA plus rectal therapy and short-term steroids only if needed; moderate-to-severe disease favors early advanced therapy, often anti-TNF with consideration of combination immunomodulator, with prednisone for induction tapers; acute severe UC mandates hospitalization, IV steroids, and timely rescue with infliximab or cyclosporine plus early surgical involvement. Continue the effective induction agent for maintenance, discontinue 5-ASA after escalation in moderate-to-severe disease, and pursue treat-to-target monitoring with endoscopy at 3–6 months if active and annual review in remission, adjusting therapy based on symptoms, biomarkers, and endoscopic healing to sustain steroid-free deep remission [^114xNeJg] [^115FP6i9].

---

Ulcerative colitis (UC) management centers on **inducing and maintaining steroid-free remission** with mucosal healing to reduce relapse, hospitalization, and colectomy risk [^1133EkY5] [^115FP6i9]. Therapy is tailored to **disease extent and severity**, with 5-ASA for mild disease [^1169438b], corticosteroids for flares, and early advanced therapies (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, JAK inhibitors) for moderate–severe or steroid-dependent disease [^114BBWTb] [^114j9hV6]. Maintenance with 5-ASA or advanced therapies is continued long term, and treat-to-target strategies using biomarkers and endoscopy guide adjustments [^116NnRQW] [^111TBLB2]. Acute severe UC requires hospitalization, IV corticosteroids, and rescue therapy or colectomy if refractory [^116C6zk4] [^116FhLee]. Multidisciplinary care, patient education, and monitoring for complications and colorectal cancer are essential [^115VKQna] [^1133EkY5].

---

## Disease classification and assessment

UC is classified by **extent and severity**: extent includes proctitis, left-sided, and extensive (pancolitis), and severity spans mild, moderate, severe, and fulminant. Assessment uses clinical scores (Mayo, UCDAI), endoscopy (Mayo endoscopic subscore), and biomarkers (fecal calprotectin, CRP) to guide therapy and monitoring [^1133EkY5] [^113tUnNy].

---

## Induction of remission

### Mild to moderate UC

- **5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)**: First-line; oral ≥ 2 g/day [^114czpzQ] ± rectal therapy [^114czpzQ] [^112XwXkq].
- **Rectal therapy**: Enemas or suppositories for distal disease [^115Mg8Db]; rectal 5-ASA preferred over rectal corticosteroids [^1171KUFN].
- **Corticosteroids**: Short-term for flares; avoid maintenance [^113SepQY] [^113Ueo4a].

---

### Moderate to severe UC

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Prednisone 40–60 mg/day [^notfound] until remission, then taper [^notfound].
- **Advanced therapies**: Early anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab), vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) [^114BBWTb] [^114j9hV6] [^116WdNv5].
- **Combination therapy**: Anti-TNF + immunomodulator (azathioprine, methotrexate) can improve efficacy [^116sLxn2] [^112n7AEp].

---

### Acute severe UC (ASUC)

Hospitalization with **IV corticosteroids** (hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours or methylprednisolone 40–60 mg/day) [^116FhLee] is first-line. Rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine is indicated for steroid-refractory cases [^111jX2xi] [^116FhLee]. Colectomy is recommended for refractory cases or at 3–5 days without improvement [^115xtQJY].

---

## Maintenance of remission

- **5-ASA**: ≥ 1.5 g/day for mild disease [^115FXMbR].
- **Immunomodulators**: Thiopurines or methotrexate for moderate–severe UC or steroid dependence [^111xt2pr] [^1149H4MY].
- **Advanced therapies**: Continue effective induction agent (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, JAK inhibitors) [^113j97zC] [^116N263f] [^114MrCv8].
- **De-escalation**: Consider after 6–12 months of remission; stop 5-ASA if escalated to advanced therapies [^114d1Coj] [^115dEkV5].

---

## Monitoring and treat-to-target approach

Regular clinical, endoscopic, and biomarker monitoring guides therapy toward **mucosal healing** and steroid-free remission [^1133EkY5] [^115FP6i9]. Biomarkers (fecal calprotectin, CRP) help detect subclinical inflammation and inform adjustments [^116NnRQW] [^113tUnNy]. Endoscopy at 6–12 months confirms mucosal healing and directs therapy [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Treat concurrently; anti-TNFs benefit arthropathy and skin disease [^notfound].
- **Colorectal cancer surveillance**: Colonoscopy every 1–3 years after 8–10 years of disease.
- **Surgery**: Colectomy for refractory disease, dysplasia, or cancer; IPAA is common [^115VKQna].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Education on disease course, medication adherence, and lifestyle (smoking cessation, diet, stress) improves outcomes [^notfound]. Adherence to 5-ASA and advanced therapies reduces relapse and complications [^116x83uH].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **S1P modulators**: Ozanimod and etrasimod are approved options [^notfound].
- **Fecal microbiota transplantation**: Under study for mild–moderate UC [^116rXHry].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers and genetics may guide therapy selection [^1116NRQs].

---

UC management is **individualized**, with therapy matched to extent and severity, and anchored in treat-to-target monitoring to achieve and maintain steroid-free remission with mucosal healing.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^112ijUva]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by growing incidence and prevalence around the world in the last few decades. The range of available existing treatment and strategies for its management is being implemented. Given the introduction of newly developed molecules and the lack of specific guidelines, drug positioning may represent a tough clinical challenge. UC management is mostly medical, and it has been shifting toward a more personalized approach with the aim to create a tailored strategy depending on the patient's profile. A treat-to target strategy seems to be the best approach to reach disease control as it allows to carry out therapeutic choices based on objective and specific parameters: histological, ultrasonographic, and molecular targets may add to the already used clinical, endoscopic, and biochemical targets. In addition, dual-targeted therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for patients not achieving remission. This review aims to provide an overview of the available strategies to raise the bar in UC.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^112Di3KC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the imperative for early initiation of therapy emerges as a pivotal strategy in optimizing UC management, facilitated by prompt diagnosis. Regrettably, many patients with UC face diagnostic delays postsymptom onset, posing a risk for adverse outcomes and significant bowel damage in IBD. Clinical evidence consistently underscores the superior response rates to drugs in patients with shorter disease duration. Thus, raising awareness of UC symptoms in primary care settings is crucial to ensure timely access to specialized care and appropriate treatment. Early disease identification enables patients to commence suitable medications promptly, with studies consistently linking timely access to immunosuppressants or biologics to improved outcomes.

Moreover, the expanding array of new therapeutic agents presents a challenge in selecting the most suitable drug for UC management. With numerous therapeutic options available for mild-to-moderate as well as moderate-to-severe forms of UC, choosing the right agent for each patient has become increasingly complex and personalized. The T2T strategy offers guidance in identifying the optimal treatment solution for individual patients in a tailored manner. Additionally, proper patient profiling is essential, involving the assessment of patient risk stratification and prognostication. Validated prognostic and predictive tools, such as biomarkers, have the potential to enable personalized therapy and facilitate the targeted use of treatments. This approach ensures that patients at lower risk receive less intensive medical therapy, while those at higher risk of disease progression are treated with more intensive strategies. However, a significant challenge lies in the time required to develop, validate, and commercialize biomarkers, highlighting the need for ongoing research and innovation in this area.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^114WGKGs]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^116NnRQW]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Symptomatically active ulcerative colitis — evaluation strategy for treatment adjustment: In patients with symptomatically active UC, the AGA suggests an evaluation strategy that combines biomarkers and symptoms, rather than symptoms alone, to inform treatment adjustments. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence) Patients, particularly those with severe symptoms, who place a high value on avoiding the burden of biomarker testing, over a potentially higher risk of inappropriate overtreatment, may reasonably choose symptom-based evaluation for treatment decisions. Evidence informing this recommendation did not identify any RCTs directly comparing the two strategies; instead, cross-sectional data show that 85%–90% of patients with RBS 2 or 3 and SFS 2 or 3 had moderate to severe inflammation on endoscopy, implying an FP rate of 10%–15%, while in similar patients the absence of elevated biomarkers decreases the FP rate to < 5%. Potential benefits of symptom-based management include convenience and faster decisions, whereas potential harms of a biomarker-based approach include costs, inconvenience of stool-based testing, and possible delays due to test completion.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^112qSrhf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

---

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1133EkY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — goals for managing patients — UC is a chronic condition for which therapy is required to induce and maintain remission; therapeutic decisions should be categorized into those for (i) induction and (ii) maintenance, and strategies for management of UC should reflect the patient's and provider's goals and recognize the chronic nature of the disease. Symptomatic remission relates to improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) while endoscopic mucosal healing is defined as restoration of intact mucosa without friability; deep remission implies both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and should be assessed as a preferred goal of management, and corticosteroid-free remission is defined based on symptomatic and endoscopic response during a steroid-free period of time (usually more than 12 wk). Initial treatment of UC should focus on restoration of normal bowel frequency and control of the primary symptoms of bleeding and bowel urgency; an endoscopically healed mucosa is associated with sustained remission and reduced risk of colectomy. Histologic remission is associated with some improved clinical outcomes but has not yet been validated prospectively as a preferred target for treatment, and control of mucosal inflammation may reduce dysplasia risk. Given the chronic nature of UC and the therapies for UC, monitoring for disease-related and drug-related complications is important, routine visits are recommended to monitor for relapse and address health maintenance needs, and patients with UC should be screened for coexistent anxiety and depressive disorders with resources provided when identified.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^1143SdgU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which most commonly presents during the third and fifth decades of life, impairs quality of life, and causes disability. Moreover, patients suffering from UC are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer throughout their life. –

UC follows a relapsing and remitting course, and its management is mostly medical. Nowadays, the UC therapy is being more and more tailored based on factors like severity and extension of disease, patient's age, comorbidities, safety and efficacy of drugs, patient's preferences, route of administration, rapidity, costs, extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), and specific settings such as pregnancy, surgical patients, and pediatric population. Various treatment options are available for managing mild-to-moderate active UC, encompassing 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants such as thiopurines and methotrexate. In cases of moderate-to-severe UC, the therapeutic approach shifts toward the utilization of advanced biological agents (including anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), anti-α4β7 integrin biologic agents, and anti-interleukin (IL)-12–23, selective IL-23 inhibitors), as well as small-molecule drugs like Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulators. However, these advanced therapies may present challenges such as primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, and immunogenicity. Addressing these challenges necessitates a precise and rational selection of therapy aimed at achieving sustained disease control, preventing complications, and ensuring long-term improvements in quality of life.

Given the progressive nature of UC, timely intervention is paramount. Early diagnosis facilitates prompt treatment initiation, increasing the likelihood of achieving remission, as optimal response rates are typically observed in patients with shorter disease durations. Furthermore, advancements in monitoring techniques are essential for optimizing treatment regimens and tailoring them to individual patient needs. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the intricate molecular pathways underlying UC pathogenesis holds promise for identifying novel therapeutic targets and refining treatment strategies. By integrating these approaches, we can maximize the efficacy of emerging therapeutics and potentially surpass the limitations associated with attaining maximal long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with UC, thus transcending the concept of a "therapeutic ceiling". This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the available strategies to raise the bar in UC management.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^1158pRmU]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — research needs for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis emphasize a better understanding of dosing and escalation strategies. The guideline notes that "Better understanding of optimal dosing regimens, in particular, which patients might benefit from initial use of high-dose mesalamine or topical mesalamine, is also required", identifies "a need to better understand the relative effectiveness and side effects of budesonide and systemic corticosteroids in patients who do not respond adequately to 5-ASAs", and states that "studies to identify the appropriate patient and timing for escalation to immunomodulators and/or biologics would help with targeting therapy appropriately".

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^1147sek8]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Biomarker-based treat-to-target strategy in ulcerative colitis — In ulcerative colitis (UC), there is a paucity of high-quality data confirming the value of a biomarker-based treat-to-target strategy. Indirect support comes from evidence in which persistent biomarker elevation, despite symptomatic remission, is associated with a higher risk of relapse; however, direct evidence is lacking. There have not been any studies comparing a biomarker-based strategy with an endoscopy-based strategy for assessment and monitoring of endoscopic remission, and this was identified as a knowledge gap by the panel.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^111b3wvi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA living clinical practice guideline — PICO questions for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis outline comparisons of pharmacologic strategies and key outcomes. Immunomodulator monotherapy options listed are thiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and methotrexate (oral or SC). For tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, combination therapy with a TNF antagonist and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is assessed with outcomes including induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. For non-TNF biologics, combination therapy with a non-TNF antagonist biologic and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is compared with non-TNF antagonist biologic monotherapy and immunomodulator monotherapy (thiopurines or methotrexate), with outcomes of induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. Among patients in steroid-free remission on combination therapy, discontinuation of an immunomodulator or discontinuation of a biologic is contrasted with continuation of combination therapy, focusing on prevention of relapse. Treatment strategies are also contrasted as top-down therapy (upfront use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy; upfront use of biologic-based combination therapy) versus step therapy (acceleration to advanced therapy only after failure of 5-ASA; initial use of immunomodulator or advanced therapy).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114Yxu3v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^113tUnNy]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Biomarkers are used frequently for noninvasive monitoring and treatment decision making in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of biomarkers for the management of UC.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, and conduct an evidence synthesis on the clinical performance of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin as biomarkers of disease activity in patients with established UC in symptomatic remission or with active symptoms. The guideline panel used the Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for the use of biomarkers for monitoring and management of UC and provided implementation considerations for clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 7 conditional recommendations. In patients with UC in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests the use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over a symptom-based monitoring strategy. For patients in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and/or normal CRP to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP to inform treatment decisions and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. However, in patients in symptomatic remission but elevated biomarkers, and in patients with moderate to severe symptoms with normal biomarkers, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease to inform treatment decisions. In patients with UC with mild symptoms, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity to inform treatment decisions. The panel identified the use of a biomarker-based monitoring strategy over an endoscopy-based monitoring strategy as a knowledge gap. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of biomarkers, and identified areas for future research.

Conclusions

In patients with UC, noninvasive biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum CRP can inform disease monitoring and management.

### What does disease progression look like in ulcerative colitis, and how might It Be prevented? [^113rwPvJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been characterized by inflammation limited to the mucosa. Although sustained and durable remission has been associated with mucosal healing, the recurrent phenomenon of persistent clinical disease activity despite mucosal healing has been observed in clinical practice and across pivotal trials. Over time, UC appears to confer an increased risk of progression, defined as changes of disease phenotype; adverse transmural effects on the bowel wall; increased risk of neoplasia development; worsening colorectal function; and increased risk of colectomy, hospitalizations, and other extraintestinal comorbidities. Although the treatment paradigm for Crohn's disease has shifted toward early aggressive intervention to prevent disease progression and irreversible bowel damage, such urgency in efforts to halt disease progression in UC have been largely overlooked. This review summarizes the multiple facets of UC contributing to a modified perception of the disease as a progressive one. We propose further study of the natural history and priorities for further treatment goals that include these considerations.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^116K3ahp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The history of UC is flagged by several clinical trials that underpin and influence our current clinical practice (Figure 1). The biological era is considered the fulcrum that is propelling current and anticipated developments in the field. Given the associated drawbacks with immunosuppressive therapies, additional treatment options are being explored and progressing to clinical trials. With this in mind, we anticipate the therapeutic landscape and current treatment paradigms to undergo marked transformation over the proceeding decade.

### Up-to-date surgery for ulcerative colitis in the era of biologics [^114Gj12e]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: In recent decades, biologics have resulted in significantly improved medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC). Rates of surgery for UC are declining. However, there is still a controversial question of the relation of biologics to postoperative adverse outcomes and the most appropriate timing for operative intervention. Areas covered: In this review, we explore the updated treatment algorithm of acute severe colitis, describe postoperative outcomes in patients exposed to biologics preoperatively, and discuss the primary indications for staging surgery in chronic refractory cases, largely with prolonged medical therapy. Expert opinion: Delaying pouch construction to when patients are in better health is suggested as a safer strategy over the long term. The surgical management of UC patients in the biologic era needs to be individualized, and a case-based multidisciplinary decision is critical for improved outcomes and a reduction of morbidity and mortality.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112g1wMy]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline — scope, biomarkers evaluated, and knowledge gaps in UC management: The guideline panel made 7 conditional recommendations and focused on serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin as biomarkers of disease activity in established UC with symptomatic remission or active symptoms. The panel identified the use of a biomarker-based monitoring strategy over an endoscopy-based monitoring strategy as a knowledge gap. In conclusions, the guideline states that in patients with UC, noninvasive biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum CRP can inform disease monitoring and management.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^116PwdXJ]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — early biologic therapy strategy. The AGA suggests early use of biologic agents with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASA (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence). Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-ASA therapy, and lower value on the efficacy of biologic agents, may reasonably choose gradual step therapy with 5-ASA therapy. Evidence notes there were no studies comparing upfront biologic-based therapy or tofacitinib vs gradual step-up therapy, that 5-ASAs have not been specifically studied in moderate to severe disease activity and are limited to mild to moderate disease, and that delaying effective treatment in moderate to severe UC at high risk of colectomy may be harmful; overall evidence supporting this recommendation was rated as very low due to serious indirectness and imprecision.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) surgical management — Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with UC still require colectomy for medically refractory disease and/or neoplasia of the colon or rectum. Complete removal of all at-risk tissue (ie, the colon and the rectum) is considered curative for the intestinal manifestations of UC. Operative strategies for patients with UC may include a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy or ileoproctostomy or total proctocolectomy with a permanent end ileostomy, a continent ileostomy, or construction of an IPAA, all of which are increasingly performed using minimally invasive techniques. Optimal management involves a multidisciplinary team approach including colorectal surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, pathologists, nutritionists, and enterostomal therapists.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^112XwXkq]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### The future of clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^112xigFV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been transformed over the past few decades by the approval of multiple classes of advanced therapies and the integration of more targeted treatment strategies for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These changes have been driven by an increasing number of pivotal randomized controlled trials, which have grown in size and complexity over time. Several landmark studies that are anticipated to change current IBD management paradigms have recently been completed or are on-going, including the first head-to-head biologic trials, advanced combination treatment trials, therapeutic strategy and treatment target trials, and multiple phase 3 registrational programs of novel compounds. Despite these advances, the future of IBD trials also faces major challenges with respect to cost, feasibility, and recruitment. Accordingly, innovative methods for early and late phase randomized controlled trials must be adopted. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of modern IBD trials, discuss methods for improving trial efficiency in early and late phase development, and provide insights into the interpretation and implications of these data for clinical care.

### Is there room for immunomodulators in ulcerative colitis? [^115tMVyz]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has evolved over the past few decades. While aminosalicylates remain the mainstay of induction and maintenance therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, the advent of biologic agents and novel oral small molecules has substantively changed the treatment landscape for patients with moderate-to-severe disease and confounded the role of traditional immunomodulators (IMMs) such as thiopurines and methotrexate in the UC management algorithm. Areas covered: We summarize the mechanism of action of thiopurines and methotrexate, identify clinical parameters for their use, and appraise the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of IMMs in UC as both monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, emphasizing on prospective, controlled data. Expert opinion: With the advent of several classes of highly effective treatments for UC, emergence of data demonstrating no benefit of IMMs over placebo, and concerns about the relative safety profile of long-term IMM exposure, we propose that the role of thiopurines or methotrexate be restricted to patients with milder disease failing to maintain corticosteroid-free remission on aminosalicylates alone or in combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists in patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117JQCQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

### Perioperative and postoperative management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^112ye89e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the number of available therapies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) continues to expand, a significant portion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease will require surgical intervention. Surgery remains an integral part of the treatment algorithm for patients with ulcerative colitis and CD, and thus multidisciplinary approaches to the perioperative and postoperative management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease are critical to improving outcomes during these periods. New mechanisms of biologic therapies are emerging and new treatment strategies focused on earlier and potentially more aggressive use of immunosuppressive therapies are advocated in the current treatment era. In this review, we outline multidisciplinary strategies for the preoperative management of immunosuppressive therapies, including a discussion of the most recent evidence regarding the safety of biologic therapy in the preoperative period. We also discuss the postoperative medical management of patients undergoing intestinal resection for CD, with a particular focus on risk stratification and appropriate therapy selection in the immediate postoperative setting. Finally, we review potential postoperative complications after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and their management.

### Quality improvement education to improve performance on ulcerative colitis quality measures and care processes aligned with national quality strategy priorities [^114GSYFp]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We observed small to substantial post-education increases in rates of performance of national quality measures for IBD and other care processes aligned with NQS priorities. In addition, the survey data reflected improvements in self-reported understanding and intentions to change practice for better patient outcomes, as well as more positive perceptions regarding barriers to the provision of high-quality ulcerative colitis care. The results of this project indicate the potential for QI education to support community-based gastroenterologists in improving their performance of clinical skills that relate to priorities of the U.S. National Quality Strategy. The project results and lessons learned offer insights into designing future programs with educational interventions that address barriers to quality improvement in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111NdPeT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### Ulcerative colitis: current medical therapy and strategies for improving medication adherence [^116x83uH]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is chronic inflammation of large intestine and often requires lifelong medication. Medical therapy aims to induce and maintain a clinical remission, reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and improve quality of life. Aminosalicylates are currently the first choice therapy both for the induction and the maintenance of remission in the patients with mild-to-moderate UC. For moderate-to-severe cases or those who do not respond to aminosalicylate therapy, additional treatment options including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biological agents, cyclosporin, tacrolimus and surgery are available. Poor adherence to medication has been an important barrier to successful management of UC. Nonadherence has been associated with increased relapse rates, higher risk of colorectal cancer, poor quality of life and significantly increased healthcare costs. Therefore, improving adherence to medication is an important approach for a better care of the patients with UC. Definitive strategies are required to help the patients effectively self manage their disease and improve adherence. This review examines current medical therapy for UC, research progresses on medication adherence and the possible strategies for improving adherence in these patients.

Regardless of the therapeutic choices made, it is also essential to ensure optimal patient engagement and compliance, which in turn will lead to a better recognition of flare symptoms and self-management. Additionally, monitoring everyday life aspects and disease burden, such as nutritional status and diet, is crucial. Several emerging studies are investigating the role of diet in patients with IBD and the potential benefits of nutritional counseling in UC management. Future clinical research is needed to evaluate the impact of dietary recommendations on therapeutic outcomes and maintain adequate nutrition(Figure 1).

Another relevant aspect in current and future UC management is the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on clinical practice. As infrastructure evolves, AI-powered disease measurement tools may enable procedures to be performed locally and analyzed via cloud-based platforms, enhancing standardization and objectivity of care. Recent advancements have seen AI replicate expert endoscopic interpretation with efficiency and near-perfect reproducibility. Moreover, AI holds promise for histologic interpretation of remission and provides real-time histologic information to IBD endoscopists without the need for biopsy.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting and potentially progressive form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of uncertain aetiology, characterised by inflammation localised in the mucosa of the rectum and colon. A number of aetiological factors, such as genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, perturbations in the gut microbiome and immune dysregulation, have been implicated. The term 'ulcerative colitis' was first coined by Sir Samuel Wilks in 1859, distinguishing it as a separate entity from infectious diarrhoeal illnesses, a condition that would, in fact, be called Crohn's disease today. Until the realisation that corticosteroid therapy induced remission, surgery was the mainstay of management. There has been an evolution in therapies since the 1950s, and conventional management evolved into the use of broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, such as amino-salicylates and corticosteroids, or immunomodulators, such as thiopurines, often sequentially with the aim of relieving symptoms and achieving remission to prevent long-term complications.

Unprecedented advances in the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of IBD in the last 2–3 decades have translated into a dramatic increase in our therapeutic armamentarium with biological and 'small molecule' therapies intercepting and abrogating the immune-inflammatory cascade. Consequently, we have seen clinical response and remission rates that have emboldened our definitions of meaningful disease control. In this paper, we undertake a journey in the pharmacological therapy of UC from corticosteroids to modern biological, small molecule and other novel therapies.

### Therapeutic strategies for the management of ulcerative colitis [^114EcNx7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Induction and maintenance of remission, mucosal healing, the avoidance of surgical intervention, and decreasing the likelihood of cancer developing are the primary therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC). For the traditional therapies, 5-aminosalicylic acid (including mesalamine), corticosteroids, and thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine), there are major changes evolving in terms of formulation, patterns of use, and appreciation of long-term benefits and toxicities. The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and tacrolimus, and infliximab, have recently defined, well-established roles. Preliminary supportive evidence is emerging in relation to novel antiinflammatory molecules such as curcumin, manipulation of the bacterial flora, enhancement of the mucosal barrier, and direct epithelial restoration. For patients in whom the disease is resistant to standard simple therapies, strategies are required to integrate these developing and new therapies into clinical practice. This review aims to highlight the evidence supporting new patterns of use of existing therapies and new therapies, and to devise therapeutic pathways that incorporate these new treatments. We propose how treatment might be optimized to improve the outcome in patients with mild-to-moderately active UC, chronic active UC, resistant proctitis, and fulminant UC.

Medical management of UC

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^116RXzs4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The criteria for defining "difficult-to-treat" patients serve as valuable indicators prompting intensified and specialized care and monitoring, referral to expert centers, or multidisciplinary approaches. In this context, early patient stratification and proactive therapeutic approaches are crucial strategies in modern IBD management. To overcome the limitations of current medications and break through the "therapeutic ceiling", selecting appropriate combination therapies may prove to be a more practical and effective strategy in real-world settings.

Combination therapies represent novel therapeutic approaches with promising outcomes in terms of both safety and efficacy for patients with IBD. The rationale behind these treatments lies in drug interactions and patient-to-patient variability. Through either additive or synergistic effects, combination therapies can offer therapeutic benefits or increase the likelihood of a patient responding to a specific drug.

One such approach is DTT, which involves combining two or more targeted therapies. DTT has emerged as an appealing option for selected patients with IBD who have not achieved remission despite undergoing advanced therapy with either biologic agents or small molecule monotherapy. DTT may be a reasonable choice in patients with IBD refractory to conventional strategies or with coexisting EIMs, like the rheumatologic ones.

### Ulcerative colitis: current treatment strategies and future prospects [^114ZdBKr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by inflammation of the mucosa and occasionally the submucosa of the colon. Conventional drug therapy for UC involves use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporine and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Alternative therapies include probiotics, nicotine and fish oil. Drugs like tacrolimus, rosiglitazone and Trichuris suis ova are being evaluated for use in UC patients. With the new biologic agents, new treatment options for UC continue to evolve. In this article we will discuss the conventional drugs, the alternative therapies and the management strategies according to the severity and extent of UC.

### Breaking the therapeutic ceiling in drug development in ulcerative colitis [^112zfQ79]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Increased knowledge of the intricate pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis has triggered an advance in drug development during the past two decades, resulting in the advent of several biological agents and small-molecule therapies. Although the increase in therapeutic options is positive, remission rates of patients with ulcerative colitis given new therapeutic agents in induction trials remain at a modest 20–30%, seemingly facing a so-called therapeutic ceiling. This therapeutic ceiling requires a critical appraisal and highlights the need for alternative strategies for drug development. In this Review, we objectively itemise the boundaries of therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis, provide possible explanations for the shortcomings of current strategies, and propose solutions to achieve better therapeutic outcomes in ulcerative colitis.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^114BBWTb]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) — upfront advanced therapy versus step-up: In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASAs [Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence]. Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and lower value on the efficacy and risks of adverse effects of advanced therapies and immunomodulators, may reasonably decline early use of these therapies. Since the last guideline published in 2020, no new randomized controlled trials comparing upfront advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy versus step-up therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC were identified, and 5-ASAs are not indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that typically affects the rectum and variable lengths of the colon. Its chronic nature, younger age at its onset, together with its increasing incidence, impose a huge impact on the quality of life of these patients as well as on the health care system. Recent epidemiological data suggest IBD as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world. The incidence of UC in the United Kingdom (UK) has been regarded as one of the highest in Western Europe.

The symptom profile of UC is usually characterised by bloody diarrhoea, urgency and abdominal pain. A 'treat to target' approach is the widely adopted strategy in the management of UC. Medical treatment options continue to evolve, and biologics have emerged as an effective treatment modality over the past decade. However, in spite of these advanced medical therapies, surgical interventions continue to play an important role in the management of UC. Studies have suggested that approximately 10–40% of patients with UC will subsequently require surgery during the course of their disease.

### Guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113YbUw5]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

The management of inflammatory bowel disease represents a key component of clinical practice for members of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). There has been considerable progress in management strategies affecting all aspects of clinical care since the publication of previous BSG guidelines in 2004, necessitating the present revision. Key components of the present document worthy of attention as having been subject to re-assessment, and revision, and having direct impact on practice include: The data generated by the nationwide audits of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management in the UK in 2006, and 2008. The publication of 'Quality Care: service standards for the healthcare of people with IBD' in 2009. The introduction of the Montreal classification for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The revision of recommendations for the use of immunosuppressive therapy. The detailed analysis, guidelines and recommendations for the safe and appropriate use of biological therapies in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The reassessment of the role of surgery in disease management, with emphasis on the importance of multi-disciplinary decision-making in complex cases. The availablity of new data on the role of reconstructive surgery in ulcerative colitis. The cross-referencing to revised guidelines for colonoscopic surveillance, for the management of metabolic bone disease, and for the care of children with inflammatory bowel disease.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^115Mg8Db]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with mild or moderate distal colitis may be treated with: oral aminosalicylate. If patients do not respond to mesalamine enemas or suppositories, oral prednisone should be administered. Patients with mild or moderate extensive colitis should begin therapy with oral sulfasalazine in daily doses titrated up to 4 to 6 g per day, or an alternative ASA in doses up to 4. 8 g per day of the active 5-ASA moiety. Oral steroids should be reserved for patients whose disease does not respond to other therapies or for patients with troubling symptoms that demand immediate improvement, and patients who receive steroids should be observed for signs of toxicity.

When the inflammation extends beyond the reach of topical therapy, oral therapy should be used, with sulfasalazine at 4 to 6 g per day being the first line of treatment. At this dosage, 80 percent of patients will experience clinical remission or improvement within four weeks. The following drug regimens were all found to be effective in maintaining remission in distal disease: sulfasalazine, 2 g per day; olsalazine, 1 g per day, Eudragit-S–coated mesalamine, 3. 2 g per day, balsalazide, 3 to 6 g per day. The combination of oral mesalamine and mesalamine enema is more effective than oral mesalamine alone. Topical corticosteroids have not been proved effective for maintaining remission. In patients with mild to moderate extensive colitis, remission is maintained by treatment with sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalamine, or balsalazide.

If patients do not respond to this first-line therapy, steroids may be administered.

### Ulcerative colitis: rapid evidence review… [^11746arc]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION The goal of managing patients with ulcerative colitis is to attain mucosal healing with symptom control so that sustained steroid-free remission can be achieved and prevent hospitalizations and surgeries. Initiation of treatment begins with stratifying disease activity into mild vs. moderate to severe. The American College of Gastroenterology Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index provides a set of criteria to help determine if the disease is in remission, mild, moderate to severe, or fulminant. TREATMENT OF MILD DISEASE The 2019 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend treatment of mild ulcerative proctitis with rectal 5-amino-salicylic acid therapies. 1 Mild to moderate colitis should be treated with a combination of rectal 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA therapies. Rectal 5-ASA enemas are preferred to rectal steroid formulations. Mesalamine is more potent than sulfasalazine for inducing remission.

TREATMENT OF MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE First-line therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is biologics. 14 Biologic agents with or without glucocorticoids and immune modulators should be used to induce and maintain remission. Thiopurines or methotrexate should not be used as monotherapy. 1 Systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission, but dosages and treatment duration should be limited. Other options for inducing remission include tumor necrosis factor–alpha antibodies, anti-integrin antibodies, anti-interleukin antibodies, and Janus kinase inhibitors 1. Fecal microbiota transplantation induces remission in some patients with ulcerative colitis, but current use is limited to clinical trials. 15–17. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE One probiotic modestly improves symptoms.

It also helps to prevent pouchitis, an abnormal immune response in patients susceptible to autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation of the rectal pouch fashioned after a colectomy. 19–21 A systematic review of six small studies found that curcumin promotes clinical and endoscopic improvement when added to conventional therapy in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. 22 Acupuncture is considered safe in addition to conventional treatment, but high-quality evidence of effectiveness is lacking. 25.

### Medical and surgical management of chronic ulcerative colitis… [^116FhLee]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In those patients with mild to moderate pancolitis, topical therapy is not an effective sole treatment modality, because enemas rarely pass the splenic flexure. Again, aminosalicylates are the cornerstone of medical therapy. In patients with active mild to moderate pancolitis, oral 5-ASA compounds at therapeutic doses, alone or combined with enema administration, will induce remission or symptomatic improvement in 60% of patients within 4 weeks. 28 For those patients who do not achieve significant symptomatic improvement or who are intolerant of aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids are very effective. Medical therapy consists of fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolytic and hematologic abnormalities. Blood transfusions may be necessary. The patient should be given nothing by mouth. Nasogastric tube decompression may be required if colonic distention is a component of the presentation.

Stool samples for Clostridium difficile toxin and cultures for enteric pathogens should be obtained. The primary treatment of either severe or fulminant CUC consists of intravenous corticosteroids. Truelove and Witts4 demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids for severe/fulminant CUC in 1955 by showing a reduction in mortality from as high as 60% to 3%. Subsequent modifications of their regimen showed that nearly three quarters of patients treated with intravenous corticosteroids will achieve remission of their symptoms within 5 days. The usual dosage depends on the intravenous corticosteroid preparation being administered. If the patient's condition improves, then they start a diet to determine whether their symptoms recur. Full-dose aminosalicylate therapy is also resumed. Eventually, the patient makes the transition to high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy. At this point, the patient may also begin mercaptopurine or azathioprine therapy.

Before starting therapy, the patient's cholesterol level should be higher than 100 mg/dL to decrease the risk of seizure activity. If the patient responds to intravenous therapy, then he or she can switch to oral cyclosporine at a daily divided oral dose that is twice the amount given intravenously that induced remission within 24 hours. These patients should also begin mercaptopurine or azathioprine therapy, as cyclosporine monotherapy has a very high rate of relapse. 30.
