## Question

treatment for moderate calcium oxalate in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat moderate calcium oxalate in urine, i.e., moderate hyperoxaluria, to prevent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and defining "moderate" severity. Then, I should determine likely etiologies that change management. Next, I will prioritize high-yield lifestyle measures and then layer targeted pharmacotherapies. After that, I need to consider special situations and safety caveats. Finally, I will outline monitoring, individualization, and escalation strategies if stones recur despite initial therapy [^117C3ee1] [^112toZph].

> Let me first confirm what "moderate hyperoxaluria" means and how to verify it. Moderate hyperoxaluria is typically in the 40–60 mg/24 h range; I should not label a patient based on one study because urinary oxalate has high intra-individual variability. Wait, let me verify best practice: at least two 24-hour urine collections on a random diet are recommended to confirm hyperoxaluria and to define the broader metabolic profile, using age-related references for interpretation, and ensuring appropriate sample handling when oxalate is measured. I should also distinguish moderate secondary or idiopathic hyperoxaluria from severe values (> 100 mg/24 h) that raise concern for primary hyperoxaluria and a different treatment pathway [^113qXcmn] [^112EHjLv] [^116ezhUo].

> Next, I should review the likely etiologies because treatment varies meaningfully. Let me think about idiopathic dietary hyperoxaluria, enteric hyperoxaluria due to fat malabsorption states such as IBD or post-bariatric surgery, and primary hyperoxaluria from enzyme deficiencies. I need to ensure I screen for enteric clues in the history and, if oxalate is very high or there are suggestive features, consider targeted testing for primary hyperoxaluria metabolites to avoid missing a genetic cause that requires pyridoxine or RNAi therapy rather than only diet. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment: EAU highlights diet and calcium-with-meals for enteric hyperoxaluria, while ERKNet recommends specialized workup when primary disease is suspected [^117C3ee1] [^1175R6tU] [^114pYzJB].

> Now, fluids are the cornerstone. I initially thought to set a universal urine volume target of 3.0 L/day, but wait, that 3 L target is primarily for cystinuria; for calcium oxalate stone formers, EAU and CUA advise achieving at least 2.5 L urine per day, which is supported by randomized evidence showing about a 55% reduction in recurrence with high fluid intake. I need to ensure the patient has a practical plan to distribute fluids over the day and into the evening to maintain dilute urine, and I will reserve the 3 L/day urine volume target for cystine formers rather than calcium oxalate patients [^116pVWdB] [^114RUawA] [^1114fG34] [^1156gjQ8].

> Let me consider dietary oxalate next. I should confirm that the patient is minimizing high-oxalate foods such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, bran, beets, and cocoa while avoiding extreme, unsupervised restriction. I need to check for hidden sources like vitamin C supplements or herbal products, and I will counsel that a plant-forward diet can still be safe if high-oxalate items are limited and the rest of the plan is balanced. If enteric hyperoxaluria is present, I should add low-fat advice and emphasize oxalate reduction even more stringently [^111bh6VX] [^112J77fm] [^115WL819].

> On calcium intake, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I first thought "high" calcium diets directly reduce stone risk because they reduce oxalate absorption, but wait, I should double-check the evidence. A small crossover study in healthy subjects with liberal oxalate intake showed that higher calcium lowered oxalate excretion but increased urinary calcium and overall raised calcium oxalate supersaturation, so it is not a simple "more is better" message. The guideline-concordant and safer stance is to maintain normal dietary calcium intake around 1.0–1.2 g/day with meals, which binds enteric oxalate without provoking calciuria from supplementation excess or low-calcium pitfalls that increase oxalate absorption [^117Tcyps] [^117FyUZE].

> I should also address dietary sodium. I need to ensure daily sodium is limited to about 1.5 g/day and not more than 2.3 g/day because sodium and calcium excretion track together, so high sodium worsens calciuria and calcium oxalate supersaturation. A randomized trial of a low-salt diet in hypercalciuric calcium stone formers showed significant reductions in urine sodium and calcium, and even a modest reduction in oxalate, which supports this advice in patients with combined abnormalities [^116HQpkH] [^111itbWT].

> Next, I will moderate animal protein and increase fruits and vegetables to provide an alkali load and raise urinary citrate. I need to confirm that the patient's total protein intake is roughly 0.8–1.0 g/kg/day, avoiding high-purine animal proteins that can raise uric acid and acid load, while encouraging fiber, fruits, and vegetables which offer a small protective effect and often improve citrate excretion [^111UPTGq] [^112uJXzK].

> Turning to pharmacotherapy, potassium citrate is my first-line agent when hypocitraturia coexists, and it can be reasonable even with normal citrate if calcium oxalate supersaturation remains high. Wait, I should confirm effectiveness and scope. Randomized data and meta-analyses show that citrate reduces recurrence in recurrent calcium stone formers, though most pronounced for low or relatively low citrate, and I should watch for calcium phosphate stone formers in whom raising urine pH may increase CaP saturation. Typical dosing is about 30–60 mEq/day in divided doses, titrated to increase citrate and reduce calcium oxalate supersaturation while monitoring potassium and gastrointestinal tolerance [^114bcW1T] [^114LZj7F] [^114deg5Y].

> For enteric hyperoxaluria specifically, I should consider elemental calcium or calcium citrate with meals to bind oxalate in the gut, generally 300–500 mg with each oxalate-containing meal. Hold on, I should verify safety. This strategy is recommended for enteric hyperoxaluria but is not a blanket recommendation for idiopathic hyperoxaluria because of the risk of raising urinary calcium; I also need to avoid excessive total calcium and be mindful of calcium carbonate cautions in patients with a history of calcium stones, using shared decision-making and monitoring [^113Z3YzH] [^1175R6tU] [^116LCLjk].

> If primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is suspected or confirmed, I should initiate a trial of pyridoxine given its role with AGXT, and if pyridoxine is ineffective, consider disease-specific therapy such as lumasiran. Let me verify that I am not overextending this to idiopathic cases: while a cautious pyridoxine trial may be considered in select idiopathic patients, robust benefit is clearest in PH1, so I should not generalize outside that context without monitoring urine oxalate response [^117C3ee1] [^113qXcmn].

> I also need to check for concomitant hypercalciuria because if present, thiazide-type diuretics can be added to reduce urinary calcium and lower recurrence risk. Evidence and guidelines support thiazides in recurrent calcium stone formers with high urine calcium, and combined use with citrate is common when both hypercalciuria and low citrate are present, provided blood pressure, electrolytes, and glucose are monitored [^114hUDwr] [^116tSoqN] [^115x1LvW].

> There are a few additional considerations I should not miss. I should advise avoiding high-dose vitamin C supplementation, as ascorbic acid is a metabolic precursor to oxalate and can raise urinary oxalate at doses around or above 1,000 mg/day. I will also consider the gut microbiome's role; colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes has been associated with lower oxalate absorption, but probiotic strategies remain investigational, so I should not overpromise here while encouraging evidence-based measures first [^113PV3fX] [^112JRGx4] [^112rtijF].

> Monitoring is essential to ensure that my plan is actually changing risk. I need to check adherence and repeat 24-hour urine testing about 6–12 weeks after major dietary or pharmacologic changes to assess volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, and creatinine, and then reassess annually if stable. Wait, I should confirm the need for multiple collections given variability: obtaining at least two collections improves confidence, and stone analysis should be pursued when possible to tailor therapy based on verified composition and patient context [^116ezhUo] [^1135BXvG] [^113gPLN1].

> I should individualize therapy based on the composite metabolic profile rather than a single abnormality on a single day. Hold on, I should verify that personalization changes practice: variability in urine chemistries and heterogeneity in stone pathophysiology mean repeated measurements and tailored combinations, for example citrate for hypocitraturia, thiazide for hypercalciuria, and calcium-with-meals specifically for enteric hyperoxaluria, are most rational, with iterative adjustments over time [^1135BXvG] [^1166jPgQ].

> If stones recur despite these steps, I need to double-check adherence, reinforce behavioral strategies, and then consider escalation. I should be cautious with investigational options: for instance, tolvaptan can raise urine volume and reduce supersaturation in the short term for patients who cannot sustain higher fluid intake, but this is not standard long-term prevention and requires careful selection and monitoring. For refractory or complex cases, referral to a tertiary stone center is appropriate, and for confirmed primary hyperoxaluria, disease-specific therapies should be prioritized [^113wh4Y4] [^117C3ee1].

> Putting this together for moderate idiopathic hyperoxaluria, my pragmatic, evidence-aligned prescription is "Volume, Veggies, and Citrates", with normal dietary calcium and sodium restriction as the backbone. Concretely: achieve at least 2.5 L urine/day, reduce high-oxalate foods while maintaining normal calcium intake with meals, limit sodium and moderate animal protein, add potassium citrate especially if citrate is low, and add a thiazide if hypercalciuria coexists, with repeat 24-hour urines to guide fine-tuning and durability of effect [^116pVWdB] [^112uJXzK] [^115x1LvW].

In moderate calcium oxalate crystalluria, the primary goals are to **reduce urinary supersaturation** [^115x1LvW] and **prevent stone recurrence** [^116Vb7hr] using individualized, evidence-based measures [^117FyUZE] [^114RUawA].

- **Hydration**: Achieve ≥ 2.5 L/day urine output [^116pVWdB] with generous fluid intake [^1114fG34], preferably water [^114RUawA].

- **Diet**: Maintain normal calcium intake (1–1.2 g/day) with meals [^117FyUZE], limit sodium to 1.5–2.3 g/day [^116HQpkH] [^111itbWT], moderate animal protein [^111UPTGq], and avoid high-oxalate foods [^111bh6VX] [^112J77fm].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Use thiazide diuretics for hypercalciuria [^114hUDwr] [^117C3ee1], potassium citrate for hypocitraturia [^114bcW1T] [^114LZj7F], and allopurinol for hyperuricosuria [^112toZph] [^115x1LvW].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess with 24-hour urine [^116ezhUo] and adjust therapy to maintain urine calcium < 200 mg/day, oxalate < 40 mg/day, citrate > 320 mg/day, and pH 6.0–6.5.

These measures align with current guidelines [^117C3ee1] [^116Vb7hr] and should be **tailored to the patient's metabolic profile and risk factors** [^1166jPgQ].

### Effects of a low-salt diet on idiopathic hypercalciuria in calcium-oxalate stone formers: a 3-mo randomized controlled trial [^111itbWT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). High credibility.

A direct relation exists between sodium and calcium excretion, but randomized studies evaluating the sustained effect of a low-salt diet on idiopathic hypercalciuria, one of the main risk factors for calcium-oxalate stone formation, are still lacking.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to evaluate the effect of a low-salt diet on urinary calcium excretion in patients affected by idiopathic calcium nephrolithiasis.

- **Design**: Patients affected by idiopathic calcium stone disease and hypercalciuria (> 300 mg Ca/d in men and > 250 mg Ca/d in women) were randomly assigned to receive either water therapy alone (control diet) or water therapy and a low-salt diet (low-sodium diet) for 3 months. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were obtained twice from all patients: one sample at baseline on a free diet and one sample after 3 months of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 210 patients were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (n = 102) or a low-sodium diet (n = 108); 13 patients (2 on the control diet, 11 on the low-sodium diet) withdrew from the trial. At the follow-up visit, patients on the low-sodium diet had lower urinary sodium (mean ± SD: 68 ± 43 mmol/d at 3 months compared with 228 ± 57 mmol/d at baseline; P < 0.001). Concomitant with this change, they showed lower urinary calcium (271 ± 86 mg/d at 3 months compared with 361 ± 129 mg/d on the control diet, P < 0.001) and lower oxalate excretion (28 ± 8 mg/d at 3 months compared with 32 ± 10 mg/d on the control diet, P = 0.001). Urinary calcium was within the normal range in 61.9% of the patients on the low-salt diet and in 34.0% of those on the control diet.

### Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium containing kidney stones in adults [^114LZj7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Kidney stones affect people worldwide and have a high rate of recurrence even with treatment. Recurrences are particularly prevalent in people with low urinary citrate levels, who have a higher incidence of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stones. Oral citrate therapy increases urinary citrate levels, which binds with calcium and inhibits crystallization, thus reducing stone formation. Despite the widespread use of oral citrate therapy for the prevention and treatment of calcium oxalate stones, the evidence to support its clinical efficacy remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium-containing kidney stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register up to 29 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Coordinator, using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium-containing kidney stones in adults treated for a minimum of six months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed studies for inclusion in this review. Data were extracted according to predetermined criteria. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, with mean differences included for continuous outcomes.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^113gPLN1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Participants reported difficulties in obtaining individualized care. They felt that the management strategy for preventing stone recurrence was generic and failed to consider their individual context or underlying diagnosis. It was suggested that stone analysis and metabolic evaluation should be conducted to allow clinicians to tailor the management strategy according to their specific types of kidney stones. Participants indicated that evaluating the metabolic cause and the stone type is not common practice and is often only offered after stone removal.

- **Participants' experiences**: "It's the process of going through and analyzing why the stones came about. In my case, it is only after they did the surgery and took it out they could identify them as calcium oxalate stones… " (Male, 60–69 years old, Auckland).

Participants experienced challenges in finding the 'right' people to tailor treatment to prevent kidney stones. They emphasized that referral pathways across medical specialties and dietetics were crucial to ensure individualized nutrition and pharmacological therapy for preventing the recurrence of kidney stones. Some participants noted poor communication between public and private providers as well as across healthcare disciplines. For instance, it was stated that urologists never passed on information after stone removal procedures to other medical specialists, particularly back to primary care. This limitation hindered their ability to modify their diet and lifestyle for self-management to prevent recurring kidney stones.

### Citrate therapy for calcium phosphate stones [^114deg5Y]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Calcium phosphate (CaP) stones represent an increasingly encountered form of nephrolithiasis, but prophylactic medical regimens are suboptimal. Although hypocitraturia is a well-described risk factor for CaP stones, strategies that enhance citrate excretion have not consistently been effective at reducing CaP saturation and stone recurrence. This review summarizes the role of citrate therapy in CaP nephrolithiasis.

- **Recent findings**: Citrate in urine inhibits CaP stone formation through multiple mechanisms, including the formation of soluble citrate-calcium complexes, and inhibition of CaP nucleation, crystal growth, and crystal aggregation. Recent in vitro studies demonstrate that citrate delays CaP crystal growth through distinct inhibitory mechanisms that depend on supersaturation and citrate concentration. The impact of pharmacological provision of citrate on CaP saturation depends on the accompanying cation. Potassium citrate imparts a significant alkali load that enhances citraturia and reduces calciuria but could worsen urine pH elevation. Conversely, citric acid administration results in minimal citraturia and alteration in CaP saturation.

Citrate, starting at very low urinary concentrations, can significantly retard CaP crystal growth in vitro through diverse mechanisms. Clinically, the net impact on CaP stone formation of providing an alkali load during pharmacological delivery of citrate into the urinary environment remains to be determined.

### Effect of high and low calcium diets on stone forming risk during liberal oxalate intake [^117Tcyps]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that a high calcium diet protects against calcium oxalate stone formation. We compared the effect of high and low calcium diets on urinary saturation of calcium oxalate during liberal oxalate intake.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 10 healthy subjects (5 male, 5 female) participated in a two-phase, randomized, crossover study comparing high (1,000 mg daily) and low (400 mg daily) calcium intake on a liberal oxalate diet (200 mg daily). During each phase, subjects adhered to an instructed diet for three days, followed by a controlled, metabolic diet for four days. Blood and 24-hour urine specimens collected on the last two days of each phase were analyzed for serum biochemistry studies and stone risk factors, respectively.

- **Results**: Urinary calcium was higher (mean ± SD 171 ± 64 vs. 124 ± 49 mg daily, p = 0.002) and oxalate was lower (25 ± 4.8 vs. 27 ± 4 mg daily, p = 0.02) on the high vs. low calcium diet. Overall, the urinary relative saturation ratio of calcium oxalate was higher on the high compared with the low calcium diet (3.3 vs. 2.5, p < 0.0001), even after adjusting for confounding variables.

- **Conclusions**: In normal subjects, urinary saturation of calcium oxalate was higher on a high calcium diet than a low calcium diet during liberal oxalate intake because the decrease in urinary oxalate did not overcome the effect of increased calcium. A high calcium diet during liberal oxalate intake may pose an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

### Short-term tolvaptan increases water intake and effectively decreases urinary calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid supersaturations [^113wh4Y4]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Some patients cannot effectively increase water intake and urine volume to prevent urinary stones. Tolvaptan, a V2 receptor antagonist, blocks water reabsorption in the collecting duct and should decrease urinary supersaturation of stone-forming solutes, although this action has never been proved.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 21 calcium urinary stone formers stratified into majority calcium oxalate (10 patients) and calcium phosphate (11) groups. Patients received 45 mg tolvaptan per day or placebo for 1 week, followed by a washout week and crossover to tolvaptan or placebo for week 3. A 24-hour urine sample was collected at the end of weeks 1 and 3.

- **Results**: Tolvaptan vs placebo decreased urinary osmolality (mean ± SD 204 ± 96 vs 529 ± 213 mOsm/kg, p 0.05 for all interactions).

- **Conclusions**: Tolvaptan increases urine volume and decreases urinary supersaturation.

### Medical management of renal stones [^112UBVsk]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing in industrialized nations, resulting in a corresponding rise in economic burden. Nephrolithiasis is now recognized as both a chronic and systemic condition, which further underscores its impact. Diet and environment play important roles in stone disease, presumably by modulating urine composition. Dietary modification as preventive treatment to decrease lithogenic risk factors and prevent stone recurrence has gained interest because of its potential to be safer and more economical than drug treatment. However, not all abnormalities are likely to be amenable to dietary therapy, and in some cases, drugs are necessary to reduce the risk of stone formation.

Unfortunately, no new drugs have been developed for stone prevention since the 1980s when potassium citrate was introduced, perhaps because the long observation period needed to demonstrate efficacy discourages investigators from embarking on clinical trials. Nonetheless, effective established treatment regimens are currently available for stone prevention.

### Stones. A matter of doubt — how best to evaluate stone formers [^1135BXvG]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Once again, the question of one versus two 24-hour urine collections for diagnosis in kidney stone prevention has been raised. As in all previous studies, no difference is seen in the mean levels of analytes between the first and second collections. However, the variation within patients is so marked that at least two collections are needed for confidence.

### Determination of the calcium oxalate crystallization risk from urine samples: The BONN risk index in comparison to other risk formulas [^1137Ft61]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Regular risk evaluation and monitoring during stone therapy are recommended to reduce recurrence of crystal formation. This strategy optimizes patient treatment with a more individualized approach and decreases the cost of overtreatment. We evaluated the BONN Risk Index (BRI) through data actualization and evaluation refinement. The BRI was compared with other common risk evaluation methods, such as the calculation of relative urinary calcium oxalate (CaOx) supersaturation (RS) and the urine activity product (AP)CaOx index to estimate urine AP with respect to CaOx.

A total of 201, 12 and 24-hour urine samples were collected from 95 healthy volunteers and 106 CaOx stone formers. Crystallization experiments following the BRI method were performed. RS and APCaOx were calculated from urinalysis. Data were indexed and individually grouped into eight classes, and frequency distributions were plotted. A calculation scheme for the BRI-based estimation of the statistical probability of a clinically healthy person being a (still nondetected) CaOx stone former is provided.

Logarithmically arranged BRI groups from healthy subject and patient data showed Gaussian frequency distributions. Compared with RS and APCaOx, BRI allowed optimal distinction between healthy subjects and stone formers. The probability of a healthy subject already being a CaOx stone former strongly increased with increasing BRI.

The BRI for evaluating CaOx crystallization risk allows reliable distinction between healthy subjects and stone formers.

### Medical management of stone disease [^112JRGx4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Dietary manipulation remains one of the most important strategies for therapy. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that severe calcium restriction is inappropriate in patients with nephrolithiasis. Dietary recommendations based on recent evidence and the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis are discussed.

- **Recent findings**: New evidence strongly supports the role of oxalate, salt, and animal protein dietary restrictions in the prevention of calcium stone recurrence. Moderate calcium restriction is only effective in absorptive hypercalciuria. In other etiologies of calcium stones, calcium restriction is not effective, and its implementation can lead to bone demineralization. New evidence has implicated the lack of intestinal bacteria in the degradation of dietary oxalate, with its higher absorption resulting in an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. The role of Oxalobacter formigenes is discussed in this context.

- **Summary**: Metabolic abnormalities responsible for stone recurrence are currently identified in 97% of evaluated patients, and remission rates of medical prophylaxis in calcium stone formers are approaching 80%. Urinary calcium excretion in most renal stone formers depends more on the dietary acid load than on dietary calcium intake itself. Reducing the acid-ash content of the diet significantly impacts decreasing stone recurrence while preventing bone loss. New evidence associates the decolonization of oxalate-degrading intestinal flora with a higher risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

### Diet to reduce mild hyperoxaluria in patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formation: a pilot study [^112zxw6a]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To assess whether a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet is effective in reducing hyperoxaluria in idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis compared with a traditional low-oxalate diet routinely recommended by clinicians, we treated 56 patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formation who presented with mild hyperoxaluria (> 40 mg/d) while consuming a free diet with a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet for a 3-month period. We compared the results obtained with this diet to those of a historical control group of 20 hyperoxaluric patients treated in the traditional way with a low-oxalate diet.

After 3 months of therapy, the mean oxaluria level had decreased from 50.2 to 35.5 mg/d with the normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet and from 45.9 to 40.2 mg/d with the traditional diet (adjusted difference between post-treatment mean value -7.3 mg/d, 95% confidence interval -12.3 to -2.2, P = 0.005). The results suggest that a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet can reduce oxalate excretion in hyperoxaluric patients. This should encourage the undertaking of a randomized-control study to confer more solid evidence in support of our findings.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^112J77fm]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperoxaluria, specifically in terms of dietary oxalate restriction, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend advising oxalate restriction for the prevention of kidney stone formation in patients with hyperoxaluria. Additionally, it is advised to reduce dietary fat and oxalate in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.

### Purslane-induced oxalate nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^116VkLYs]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Regarding treatment interventions, the withdrawal of oxalate-rich foods or precursors after the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), combined with adequate fluid intake and calcium supplementation, is necessary. As calcium intake is low, urinary oxalate excretion increases. A dietary oxalate intake of less than 100 mg/day and adequate dietary calcium intake of 1000–1200 mg/day are recommended. In addition, renal replacement therapy can be administered based on the patient's actual condition. However, some cases require only conservative treatment. We also prescribed steroids for the patient in Case 1 to suppress tubular inflammation. However, steroids appear redundant as there are no reports in the literature specifying their necessity. Furthermore, the prognosis of oxalate nephropathy is variable and may be favorable in cases of acute intake of excessive dietary oxalate. Our patients required temporary hemodialysis and experienced almost complete renal recovery.

The possibility of oxalate nephropathy should be considered in the presence of calcium oxalate stones, calcium oxalate crystals in urine sediment, unexplained renal damage associated with multicentric systemic oxalosis, and calcium oxalate crystallization identified by renal biopsy. Physicians should correlate these features with the patient's clinical details, including history of gastrointestinal surgery, dietary status, medication history, and genetic history. A renal biopsy should also be actively performed if there are no contraindications, even when genetic testing is performed to exclude primary hyperoxaluria, particularly in children.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116ezhUo]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically concerning urine tests, AUA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining metabolic testing. This should consist of one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet. The urine should be analyzed at a minimum for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium, and creatinine in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis, or in high-risk or interested patients with a first episode of nephrolithiasis.

### Dietary therapy for patients with hypocitraturic nephrolithiasis [^111mSj14]. Nature Reviews Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Citrate is an inhibitor of urinary stone formation. Clinical and in vitro data suggest that increasing urine citrate levels will decrease the precipitation of calcium stones. Historically, low urinary citrate has been treated with oral potassium citrate or sodium citrate supplementation. However, recent studies have shown the potential of dietary interventions to raise urine citrate levels. Dietary therapy with commercial or homemade beverages is attractive to patients who would prefer nonpharmacological intervention. At the time of writing, several drinks have shown promise, but no single beverage has been found to consistently raise urine citrate levels in a reproducible fashion. Further research is necessary to develop the ideal dietary therapy for hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis.

### Prospective study on the efficacy of a selective treatment and risk factors for relapse in recurrent calcium oxalate stone patients [^1167QVxZ]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The present study was performed to examine the efficacy of a selective treatment according to the guidelines for the prevention of recurrence in calcium oxalate stone patients and to assess risk factors for stone recurrence.

To investigate the effect of specific diagnostic and therapeutic measures, 134 recurrent calcium oxalate stone formers participated in a prospective study for two years with regular follow-ups at least every six months. Depending on the results of analysis of 24-hour urine, nutrition record, and metabolic situation, selective recommendations were given concerning diet and medication.

Throughout the follow-up period, 57 (43%) of the patients experienced relapses. In recurrence-free patients, the significant increase in urinary volume, as well as urinary pH, potassium, and citrate excretion — three indexes of compliance with alkalization — resulted in a significant decrease in the calculated risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. In patients with recurrences during follow-up, the relative supersaturation with calcium oxalate increased significantly, mainly due to the significant rise in urinary oxalate excretion, which exceeded the significant increases in urinary volume, pH, potassium, and citrate excretion. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed previous ESWL treatment and a history of multiple stones as independent predictors of the risk for recurrence.

The results indicate that compliance with drinking advice and alkalization therapy was highest among both patients with and without recurrences.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^116XjQ6s]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

- **Methods**: Extensive reviews of the literature, combined with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics by a working group of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

- **Results and conclusions**: Recommendations are provided for managing patients with acute stone colic and for the active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### Medical management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: A systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical guideline [^115x1LvW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Optimum management to prevent recurrent kidney stones is uncertain. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.

Data sources included MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other databases through September 2012, as well as reference lists of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

The study selection comprised 28 English-language RCTs that studied treatments to prevent recurrent kidney stones and reported stone outcomes.

Data extraction involved one reviewer extracting data, a second checking accuracy, and two independently rating quality and grading strength of evidence.

Data synthesis indicated that in patients with one past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved the composite stone risk compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84]). Low-strength evidence also demonstrated that reducing soft-drink consumption decreased symptomatic stone risk (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.98]). For patients with multiple past calcium stones, most of whom were receiving increased fluid intake, moderate-strength evidence showed that thiazides (RR, 0.52 [CI, 0.39 to 0.69]), citrates (RR, 0.25 [CI, 0.14 to 0.44]), and allopurinol (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.42 to 0.84]) each further reduced composite stone recurrence risk compared with placebo or control, although the benefit from allopurinol seemed limited to patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Other baseline biochemistry measures did not allow prediction of treatment efficacy.

### Effectiveness of treatment modalities on kidney stone recurrence [^1119afhY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is highly prevalent across all demographic groups in the Western world and beyond, with rising incidence rates. In addition to the morbidity of the acute event, stone disease often becomes a lifelong issue requiring preventative therapy to reduce ongoing morbidity. Across most stone types, increased fluid intake and targeted dietary modifications are mainstays of therapy. Specific dietary interventions associated with reduced calcium stone risk include adequate dietary calcium intake and restriction of sodium, protein, and oxalate intake, among others.

Pharmaceutical therapy may be necessary if lifestyle changes are insufficient to minimize stone recurrence risk and must be tailored to the specific metabolic abnormalities portending risk for a given patient. Therapeutic options for idiopathic calcium stone disease include thiazides, citrate salts, and uric acid-lowering agents. Alkali salts are the treatment of choice for uric acid stone disease. Management of struvite stone disease is largely surgical, but acetohydroxamic acid is a proven second-line therapy. Cystinuria requires lifestyle modifications and may call for thiol-binding agents.

Significant heterogeneity in the clinical population with stone disease has previously limited opportunities for large randomized controlled trials. However, as clinical phenotypes and genotypes are increasingly clarified, opportunities for targeted randomized controlled trials in stone prevention are mounting. In the meantime, the currently available evidence for both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions is critical for patient management and treatment strategies.

### Twenty-four-hour urine chemistries and the risk of kidney stones among women and men [^114Y6Uuf]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Results of a 24-hour urine collection are integral to the selection of the most appropriate intervention to prevent kidney stone recurrence. However, the currently accepted definitions of normal urine values are not firmly supported by the literature. In addition, little information is available about the relationship between risk of stone formation and the levels of urinary factors. Unfortunately, the majority of previous studies of 24-hour urine chemistries were limited by the inclusion of recurrent stone formers and poorly defined controls.

- **Methods**: We obtained 24-hour urine collections from 807 men and women with a history of kidney stone disease and 239 without a history who were participants in three large ongoing cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study I (NHS I; mean age of 61 years), the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II; mean age of 42 years), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; mean age of 59 years).

- **Results**: Mean 24-hour urine calcium excretion was higher and urine volume was lower in cases than controls in NHS I (P ≤ 0.01), NHS II (P ≤ 0.13), and HPFS (P ≤ 0.01), but urine oxalate and citrate did not differ. Among women, urine uric acid was similar in cases and controls but was lower in cases in men (P = 0.06). The frequency of hypercalciuria was higher among the cases in NHS I (P = 0.26), NHS II (P = 0.03), and HPFS (P = 0.02), but 27%, 17%, and 14% of the controls, respectively, also met the definition of hypercalciuria. The frequency of hyperoxaluria did not differ between cases and controls, but was three times more common.

### Diet-induced oxalate nephropathy [^117P2RE1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019).

Because of the rarity of diet-induced oxalate nephropathy, specific treatment guidelines do not exist. However, the management of enteric hyperoxaluria has been described. The recommended management includes a low oxalate diet, high fluid intake, calcium carbonate (to bind oxalate), and potassium citrate (to correct metabolic acidosis). We prescribed a low oxalate diet, high fluid intake, and calcium acetate (to achieve both binding of oxalate and control of phosphate).

- **Patient's perspective**: I am writing on behalf of my father. First, let me say that we are eternally grateful to our doctor for her determination and expertise in investigating and diagnosing the reasons for my dad's sudden kidney failure, and more so, for her careful follow-up of his care from the point of diagnosis such that he has been able to regain kidney function, avoid dialysis, and resume much of his daily routine pre-kidney failure. We joke that she was a real-life 'Columbo'.

To put his case in perspective, prior to falling ill, my dad was the picture of health. Just several weeks prior to his kidney failure, he was clearing heavy brush from his property and cleaning up a small landslide of mud that had run into his neighbor's property. He was not what most think of for an 81-year-old man. Up to the point of his kidney failure, although closely managing type 2 diabetes for approximately 30 years, he had never been hospitalized, never had an intravenous insertion, and never been subjected to tests such as CT scans and biopsies.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^1124wcML]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

All patients satisfying the selection criteria were asked to submit a 24-hour urine collection after one and four months, respectively, for the measurement of 24-hour urine output, and urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, citrate, urea, uric acid, sodium, sulphate, creatinine, and evaluation of urinary pH. The averages of the two measures were taken as baseline. During the second urine submission, patients received a complete physical evaluation, including measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference, and a blood sample was collected for routine hematochemistry as part of the baseline evaluation.

The baseline evaluation also included a visit with a dietician who provided the diet (Table S1) and a questionnaire to assess patient compliance with the diet. Patients allocated to lemon juice supplementation were recommended to drink 60 mL of fresh lemon juice twice daily, an amount expected to provide six grams or 92 mEq of citric acid per day. All patients, regardless of treatment randomisation, were maintained on their standardised diet and advised not to reduce daily fluid intake.

Baseline evaluations, including measurement of 24-hour urine output, urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, citrate, urea, uric acid, sodium, sulphate, creatinine, dietician evaluation, and renal ultrasound, were repeated at six months and then at one and two years after randomisation. X-ray evaluations were not standardised and were performed as deemed clinically appropriate.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^111WNLks]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is the most common form of nephrolithiasis. It may affect two to fifteen percent of the general population, with an incidence rate ranging from 114 to 720 new cases reported every year per 100,000 individuals. Without specific pharmacological therapy, 27 to 50 percent of patients may experience stone recurrence over five years. Notably, in 15 percent of cases, recurrence of stones is associated with clinical symptoms, and many symptomatic patients require surgical intervention annually.

Kidney stone formation requires crystals to form, grow, aggregate, and interact with a non-crystalline organic matrix. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes an increased excretion of urinary lithogenic solutes, including calcium, oxalate, phosphate, uric acid, and sodium, along with a reduced urinary excretion of inhibitors of crystallization such as citrate and magnesium. Moreover, a reduction or an increase in urinary pH may favor the precipitation of uric acid or calcium phosphate salts, respectively.

In addition to genetic and metabolic factors, environmental factors, including diet, play an important role in the development of nephrolithiasis. A diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake, may reduce the risk of stone formation. However, the efficacy in preventing stone recurrences is limited, particularly in chronic stone formers. Potassium citrate is effective in preventing stone recurrence in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, but approximately one third of treated patients experience recurrence.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^114DCHc2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The primary outcome variable of the study was the time to stone recurrence. Based on previous reports, regardless of baseline stratification, 40% of patients in the control arm on diet alone (with or without potassium citrate supplementation) were expected to have at least one new stone formation over a two-year follow-up. Over the same observation period, new stone formation was expected to be observed in 20% of patients on active treatment with fresh lemon juice. A reduction to 20% with fresh lemon juice supplementation was considered a clinically relevant effect. To provide the trial with an 80% power to detect statistically significant differences (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed test) in event rate (40% vs. 20%) between the two treatment groups, 91 patients per group were needed for statistical evaluation. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, 101 patients per group were included. Thus, a total of 202 patients were randomized.

All outcomes were assessed by intention-to-treat analyses. For survival data, the Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot the probability of achieving the endpoints of interest. Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed, with results expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The primary analysis, i.e. time to stone recurrence, was assessed using the unadjusted Cox model. In a post-hoc analysis, an adjusted model taking into account age, sex, and baseline stratification (i.e. normocitraturia or hypocitraturia) was utilized.

### Oxalate and urinary stones [^113PV3fX]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate is a major component of renal stones, and its urinary concentration plays an important role in stone formation. Even a small increase in urinary oxalate has a significant impact on calcium oxalate saturation. Although primary hyperoxaluria is relatively uncommon, patients with calcium oxalate stones often exhibit some degree of hyperoxaluria. To understand the underlying causes of this condition, it is essential to clarify the processes of oxalate synthesis and excretion. This article focuses on determining oxalate levels, calculating its saturation, and examining hyperoxaluric syndromes. Special reference is made to the metabolic precursors of oxalate, including ascorbic acid, glyoxylate, and glycolate.

### Cuprimine [^113C8SNh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Cuprimine is recommended for use alongside conventional therapy for cystinuria patients. By reducing urinary cystine, it helps decrease crystalluria and stone formation. In some instances, it has been reported to decrease the size of, and even dissolve, stones already formed.

The usual dosage of Cuprimine for the treatment of cystinuria in adults is 2 g/day, with a range of 1 to 4 g/day. For pediatric patients, the dosage can be based on 30 mg/kg/day. The total daily amount should be divided into four doses. If four equal doses are not feasible, a larger portion should be administered at bedtime. If adverse reactions require a reduction in dosage, it is crucial to retain the bedtime dose.

Initiating dosage with 250 mg/day and increasing gradually to the requisite amount allows for closer control of the drug's effects and may help reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.

Patients taking Cuprimine should drink copiously. It is particularly important to drink approximately a pint of fluid at bedtime and another pint once during the night, as urine is more concentrated and more acidic at these times. A greater fluid intake reduces the required dosage of Cuprimine.

Dosage must be individualized to limit cystine excretion to 100 to 200 mg/day in those with no history of stones, and below 100 mg/day in those who have experienced stone formation and/or pain. Therefore, when determining dosage, factors such as the inherent tubular defect, patient's size, age, rate of growth, diet, and water intake must be considered.

### Can 24-hour urine stone risk profiles predict urinary stone composition [^111dhZXx]. Journal of Endourology (2014). Low credibility.

Distinguishing calcium oxalate from uric acid stones is critical to identify those patients who may benefit from dissolution therapy and can also help direct preventive measures for stone growth. We aim to study whether 24-hour urine analysis may predict the urinary stone composition.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively identified patients with calcium oxalate and uric acid stone compositions who also had a 24-hour urine collection within 3 months of stone analysis. Patients with calcium phosphate, cystine, and other stone compositions were excluded. Subjects were divided based on their stone type (calcium oxalate vs. uric acid stones) and were compared according to demographic data and 24-hour urine analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between stone composition and covariates. A nomogram was then constructed to predict uric acid stones over calcium oxalate stones.

Results

Of the 1163 patients identified, 1054 (90.6%) had calcium oxalate stones and 109 (9.4%) had uric acid stones. On logistic regression, body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio [OR] 1.351, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.133–1.609; P < 0.001), urinary sodium (OR 1.021, 95% CI 1.004–1.037; P = 0.013), calcium (OR 0.987, 95% CI 0.979–0.996; P = 0.003), oxalate (OR 0.890, 95% CI 0.804–0.985; P = 0.024), and uric acid (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.982–0.997; P = 0.005) were significant predictors for urinary stone composition. The nomogram with the highest concordance index (c-index = 0.855) was obtained using age, BMI, urinary sodium, calcium, oxalate, and uric acid.

### Breaking the cycle of recurrent calcium stone disease [^1166jPgQ]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). High credibility.

Calcium stones are common in nature, yet few therapeutic tools are available for secondary prevention. Personalized approaches for stone prevention have been informed by 24-hour urine testing to guide dietary and medical interventions. However, evidence is conflicting about whether an approach guided by 24-hour urine testing is more effective than a generic one. The available medications for stone prevention, namely thiazide diuretics, alkali, and allopurinol, are not always prescribed consistently, dosed correctly, or tolerated well by patients.

New treatments on the horizon hold the promise of preventing calcium oxalate stones by degrading oxalate in the gut, reprogramming the gut microbiome to reduce oxalate absorption, or knocking down the expression of enzymes involved in hepatic oxalate production. New treatments are also needed to target Randall's plaque, the root cause of calcium stone formation.

### Alkalinizing agents: A review of prescription, over-the-counter, and medical food supplements [^1124ErUL]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney stones affect 1 in every 11 people in the United States each year. There is a significant high recurrence rate without a stone prevention protocol. Alkali citrate is beneficial in decreasing stone recurrence, but due to the cost and gastrointestinal side effects, there is a low adherence rate. This study aims to serve as a review of some of the most commonly used alkalizing over-the-counter supplements advertised to prevent and treat kidney stones.

- **Methods**: Data were gathered through a comprehensive online literature search and company inquiries for kidney stone prevention supplements. An additional informal poll of the authors selected supplements commonly taken by their patients. A total of eight supplements were evaluated for cost, alkali equivalent provided, dosing, and regulatory information.

- **Results**: Eight of the most commonly used supplements were reviewed with a focus on alkalizing agents. Information reviewed revealed dosing recommendations resulting in decreased citrate alkali equivalents per day compared with prescription-strength potassium citrate. Cost, peer-reviewed study results, and regulatory data were reviewed, tabulated, and analyzed. Cost per alkali equivalent was substantially decreased for each supplement compared with the prescribed drug. All supplements were found to be readily available online.

Over-the-counter alkalizing agents are available to patients and may be an appropriate alternative to cost-prohibitive potassium citrate when treating urolithiasis patients. Additional testing will be necessary.

### A new era in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones [^112rtijF]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most prevalent type of kidney stone. The amount of oxalate excreted in the urine is a major risk factor for CaOx stone formation.

### Kidney stones: Pathophysiology and medical management [^114YWGjd]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. It is imperative that clinicians look for the underlying causes of nephrolithiasis to direct management. There have been many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, I provide a brief general background and focus mainly on the pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single-gene defects, the polygenetic causes of kidney stones remain largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on the urinary luminal chemical composition of precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on the combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.

### Water for preventing urinary stones [^1114fG34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Urinary stones are a common condition characterized by high incidence and high recurrence rate. For a long time, increased water intake has been the main preventive measure for the disease and its recurrence. This work updates a review originally published in 2004.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of increased water intake for the primary and secondary prevention of urinary stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Chinese Biomedical Disk using a search strategy developed in conjunction with Cochrane Renal Group's Trials Search Coordinator. No language restriction was applied. The date of the last search was April 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of increased water intake for the prevention of urinary stones and its recurrence were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: No studies of increased water intake for the primary prevention of urinary stones met the inclusion criteria. One study with 199 patients provided results of increased water intake for the recurrence of urinary stones. The stone recurrence was lower in the increased water intake group than in the no intervention group (12% versus 27%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84).

### Changes in renal papillary density after hydration therapy in calcium stone formers [^112g3iAr]. BMC Urology (2018). High credibility.

An adequate intake of fluids is regarded as one of the mainstays of treatment for stone disease; a randomized controlled trial on patients at their first episode of idiopathic calcium stone showed that increasing water intake to obtain 2 L of urine per day or more reduced the risk of recurrence at 5 years by about 55%. Despite the proven efficacy of hydration in stone disease, changes in renal papillary density associated with increased water intake have not been investigated before. The results of our study suggest that increased fluid intake is likely to modify the concentration of lithogenic salts in the renal tissue; whether these changes would reflect in an actual reduction in risk of recurrence remains to be elucidated. Our study also highlights the need to include the HU of the renal papillae in future studies investigating interventions for stone prevention.

- **Strengths of the study**: Our study has several strengths: a cohort composed of phenotypically homogeneous patients (reCalcium oxalate stone formers), whose stone composition was assessed by means of the gold-standard infrared spectroscopy. All patients underwent the same urological procedure and the radiological images were obtained and analyzed prospectively. They all received the same indication in terms of hydration (e.g. at least 2 L per day of hypotonic oligomineral water) and the follow-up was relatively long (at least 12 months). Furthermore, patients were asked and reminded about their increased fluid intake through phone contacts. We also had available data on blood and 24-hour urine chemistries.

### The efficacy of dietary intervention on urinary risk factors for stone formation in recurrent calcium oxalate stone patients [^114iwrkT]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Nutrition is suggested to be the major environmental risk factor in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease. The study was designed to evaluate the effect of dietary intervention on urinary risk factors for recurrence in calcium oxalate stone formers.

A total of 76 men and 31 women with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease collected 24-hour urine on their habitual, self-selected diets and after 7 days on a balanced standardized diet according to the recommendations for calcium oxalate stone formers.

On the usual diet, a urine volume of less than 2.0 liters per 24 hours was observed in 57.9% of patients. Hypercalciuria was present in 25.2%, hypomagnesuria in 18.7%, hyperoxaluria in 14.0%, hyperuricosuria in 41.3%, and hypocitraturia in 57.0% of patients. The frequency of metabolic abnormalities and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation decreased significantly on the ingestion of the balanced diet. This was due to the significant increase in urinary volume, pH, and citrate excretion, along with the significant decrease in urinary calcium and uric acid excretion. No change occurred in urinary oxalate and magnesium excretion.

The evaluation of urinary risk profiles of the patients on their usual dietary habits revealed a high risk for calcium oxalate stone formation. A low fluid intake and an increased intake of protein and alcohol were identified as the most important dietary risk factors. The shift to a nutritionally balanced diet, according to the recommendations for calcium oxalate stone formers, significantly reduced the stone-forming potential.

### Prevention of urinary stones with hydration (PUSH): Design and rationale of a clinical trial [^113JYmxR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Although maintaining high fluid intake is an effective low-risk intervention for the secondary prevention of urinary stone disease, many patients with stones do not increase their fluid intake.

- **Study design**: We describe the rationale and design of the Prevention of Urinary Stones With Hydration (PUSH) Study, a randomized trial of a multicomponent behavioral intervention program to increase and maintain high fluid intake. Participants are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control arm. The target sample size is 1,642 participants.

- **Setting & participants**: Adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a symptomatic stone history and low urine volume are eligible. Exclusion criteria include infectious or monogenic causes of urinary stone disease and comorbid conditions that preclude increased fluid intake.

- **Interventions**: All participants receive usual care and a smart water bottle with a smartphone application. Participants in the intervention arm receive a fluid intake prescription and an adaptive program of behavioral interventions, including financial incentives, structured problem-solving, and other automated adherence interventions. Control arm participants receive guideline-based fluid instructions.

- **Outcomes**: The primary endpoint is the recurrence of a symptomatic stone during 24 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include changes in radiographic stone burden, 24-hour urine output, and urinary symptoms.

- **Limitations**: Periodic 24-hour urine volumes may not fully reflect daily behavior.

Conclusions: With its highly novel features, this study aims to provide insights into effective interventions for preventing the recurrence of urinary stones.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111xPPpV]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to provide novel insights into areas where low consensus exists among guideline panels and where additional evidence may enhance consensus.

- **Methods**: The webpages of the 61 members of the Société Internationale d'Urologie were analyzed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was conducted to determine consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While seven national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we identified several discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

- **Conclusions**: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis.

### Prevention of nephrolithiasis [^111QDiXD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The high incidence of recurrence after an initial stone event underscores the need for an effective medical prophylactic program. Dietary modification and drug therapies have long been advocated to reduce the likelihood of stone recurrence. While the efficacy of a high fluid intake has been validated in a randomized trial, the benefit of other dietary measures is based on the modulation of urinary stone risk factors and outcomes derived from observational studies. Several drug therapies have been evaluated in a limited number of prospective, randomized trials, and efficacy has been demonstrated for thiazides, allopurinol, and alkali citrate in some populations of recurrent stone formers. The role of selective versus nonselective therapy for stone prevention awaits further study.

### Clinical effectiveness of calcium oxalate stone treatments [^113osJRF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Lowering kidney stone risk and urine calcium oxalate supersaturation is a primary clinical focus for kidney stone prevention and can be achieved with multiple strategies. Common strategies include advice to increase fluid intake, restrict dietary sodium, or prescribing a thiazide-type diuretic. We investigated how physicians make these decisions in real-world practice and evaluated their efficacy based on 24-hour urine collections.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical charts for 203 kidney stone formers with idiopathic calcium stones from the University of Chicago Kidney Stone Clinic between 2005 and 2020. Patients had three 24-hour urines before an initial pre-treatment clinic visit and one follow-up 24-hour urine. We analyzed changes in urine composition based on treatment advice using t-tests and ANOVA.

- **Results**: Patients who received advice to increase fluid intake had lower urine volume at baseline (1.5 vs. 2.5 L/day, p < 0.001) and a larger increase in urine volume at follow-up (0.6 vs. 0.1 L/day, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive the advice. Patients who were advised to restrict dietary sodium had a higher urine sodium at baseline (208 vs. 139 mEq/day, p < 0.001), a larger reduction in urine sodium (-28 vs. 13 mEq/day, p = 0.002), and a larger reduction in urine calcium (-74 vs. -28 mg/day, p = 0.005) compared with those not advised to restrict dietary sodium. Patients started on a thiazide had a higher baseline urine calcium (281 vs. 213 mg/day) and a larger reduction in urine calcium (-83 vs. -9 mg/day, p < 0.001) compared with patients not started on a thiazide.

### Adjudication of self-reported symptomatic stone recurrence in the prevention of urinary stones with hydration trial [^113tcJ51]. Urology (2024). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the accuracy of self-reported stone events in a large clinical trial by adjudication against the weight of documentation for spontaneous stone passage or surgical intervention.

- **Methods**: Participants in the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) trial were randomized to a multi-component behavioral intervention or control arm to increase and maintain high fluid intake. The primary endpoint was urinary stone events, including symptomatic stone passage or procedural intervention. An independent adjudication committee, blinded to randomization assignments, reviewed all events. Confirmed clinical stone events required typical stone symptoms and documentation of stone passage (e.g. via photograph, clinical record) and/or surgical intervention. Events with typical symptoms and self-described stone passage but without objective documentation of passage were also considered as meeting the primary endpoint and classified separately as patient-reported passage. Non-events did not meet either criteria.

- **Results**: At the time of this blinded analysis, a total of 1658 participants were randomized and had a median follow-up of 19 months. Self-reported stone events (n = 217) were adjudicated by the committee as either confirmed clinical events (134; 61.8%), patient-reported passage (71; 32.7%), or non-events (12; 5.5%). Confirmed clinical events consisted of stone passage in 66 out of 134 cases and procedural interventions in 68 out of 134 cases (53 for symptoms and 15 without symptoms).

- **Conclusion**: Rigorous adjudication revealed that self-reported stone events in the PUSH trial overwhelmingly…

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^116JHNf2]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, particularly in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone, such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and uric acid stones. However, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention.

Certain medications, like protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of certain types of kidney stones. Patients should be counseled about these risks. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk, but weight loss could hinder prevention if associated with high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration.

For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral water. Conversely, for calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly used alongside fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116Vb7hr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention, and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature.

- **Materials and methods**: The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on nephrolithiasis in adults. To augment and broaden the body of evidence in the AHRQ report, the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori. In total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as clinical principles and expert opinions.

- **Results**: Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients, and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients.

- **Conclusions**: A variety of medications and dietary measures have been evaluated with greater or less rigor for their efficacy in reducing recurrence rates in stone formers. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is recommended.

### Challenges in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nephrolithiasis [^111bF2gs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The incidence of renal stones is rising along with the costs and morbidity associated with this condition. With careful evaluation and management, the great majority of recurrent stones are preventable. The cornerstone of this evaluation remains the 24-hour urine collection. This review details the physiological rationale for commonly requested urine studies and how these results should guide therapy, with special emphasis on recent advances in understanding risk factors for stone disease. The challenges associated with the complicated patient will be addressed.

Long-term follow-up and repeated evaluations are effective at preventing recurrent stones and increasing patient satisfaction. There is growing appreciation of the complexity of dietary risks for stone disease, and traditional risk factors such as dietary oxalate must be reevaluated.

The key to stone prevention is the individualization of therapy to specific patient risk factors, with a recognition that these factors can change over time, leading to a need for alterations in preventive therapies.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^113mM2HC]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Fresh lemon juice has been suggested as a possible alternative to potassium citrate for the treatment of patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, particularly those with hypocitraturia. However, the results of the few studies designed to evaluate the effects of lemon juice supplementation in these patients are flawed by the retrospective, observational design and a small sample size, which is insufficient to test treatment effects with adequate statistical power.

Thus, we designed a pragmatic Prospective, Randomised, Open, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) trial to evaluate the effects of fresh lemon juice supplementation, compared to no supplementation, on the long-term risk of stone recurrence in patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. All participants were prescribed a standard diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake.

### Alkaline water: Help or hype for uric acid and cystine urolithiasis [^114QzeCm]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The consumption of alkaline water, water with an average pH of 8 to 10, has been steadily increasing globally as proponents claim it to be a healthier alternative to regular water. Urinary alkalinization therapy is frequently prescribed in patients with uric acid and cystine urolithiasis, and as such, we analyzed commercially available alkaline waters to assess their potential to increase urinary pH.

- **Materials and methods**: Five commercially available alkaline water brands (Essentia, Smart Water Alkaline, Great Value Hydrate Alkaline Water, Body Armor SportWater, and Perfect Hydration) underwent anion chromatography and direct chemical measurements to determine the mineral contents of each product. The alkaline content of each bottle of water was then compared to that of potassium citrate (the gold standard for urinary alkalinization) as well as to other beverages and supplements used to augment urinary citrate and/or the urine pH.

- **Results**: The pH levels of the bottled alkaline water ranged from 9.69 to 10.15. Electrolyte content was minimal, and the physiologic alkali content was below 1 mEq/L for all brands of alkaline water. The alkali content of alkaline water is minimal when compared to common stone treatment alternatives such as potassium citrate. In addition, several organic beverages, synthetic beverages, and other supplements contain more alkali content than alkaline water, and can achieve the AUA and European Association of Urology alkali recommendation of 30 to 60 mEq per day with ≤ 3 servings/d.

- **Conclusions**: Commercially available alkaline water has negligible alkali content compared to other stone treatment methods.

### Case report: Disease mechanisms and medical management of calcium nephrolithiasis in rheumatologic diseases [^114mdGv2]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The treatment of stones in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on increasing fluid intake to achieve a urine volume above 2 liters. For those with enteric hyperoxaluria, a low oxalate diet is crucial. This diet involves avoiding foods like spinach, rhubarb, almonds, cashews, peanuts, cocoa powder, bran cereal, wheat germ, Swiss chard, beets, and vitamin C. Additionally, a low-fat diet is appropriate to decrease intestinal calcium binding.

For patients with hyperoxaluria, calcium supplements taken with meals can help bind oxalate in the gut and prevent its absorption. A dietary calcium intake of 800–1200 mg daily is suggested. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may help lower urine levels of oxalate and reduce the risk of stone formation. The enzyme alanine glycoxylate aminotransferase, which converts systemic glycoxylate to glycine instead of oxalate, is dependent on pyridoxine as a cofactor. Therefore, pyridoxine deficiency can increase the conversion of glycoxylate to oxalate. The recommended pyridoxine dose is approximately 100 mg daily.

Magnesium repletion is suggested in cases of magnesium deficiency since magnesium can bind urine oxalate and inhibit calcium oxalate formation. For patients with low urine citrate, increased intake of fruits and vegetables, excluding those with high oxalate content, especially citrus fruits, is beneficial. The use of citrate or alkalinizing agents, such as bicarbonate, aims to achieve a target urine pH greater than 6.5. Uric acid stones may even dissolve with the alkalinization of the urine. The use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors is also considered.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1168Jo1a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the comparative effectiveness and safety of preventive dietary and pharmacologic management of nephrolithiasis in adults.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on published literature identified using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (up to March 2014), Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science. Searches were limited to English-language publications. The clinical outcomes evaluated include symptomatic stone recurrence, pain, urinary tract obstruction with acute renal impairment, infection, procedure-related illness, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, and end-stage renal disease. The guideline grades the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using ACP's clinical practice guidelines grading system. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all adults with nephrolithiasis (≥ 1 prior kidney stone episode).

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 liters of urine per day to prevent nephrolithiasis (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends pharmacologic monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol to prevent nephrolithiasis in patients with active disease in which increased fluid intake fails to reduce.
