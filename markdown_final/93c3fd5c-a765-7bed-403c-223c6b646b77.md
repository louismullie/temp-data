## Question

What Type of Ct angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what type of CT angiogram is used to rule out pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology for the CT study. Then, I should verify the standard technical protocol and why it is preferred. Next, I will review diagnostic performance and when a negative study safely excludes PE. After that, I need to consider pretest probability and guideline-based algorithms that determine when to order CTPA. Finally, I should address special populations, alternatives when CTPA is contraindicated, and summarize a practical recommendation with caveats about overuse and safety.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. The correct study is computed tomography pulmonary angiography, also called CT pulmonary angiography or CTPA, which directly visualizes the pulmonary arteries with contrast to detect or exclude emboli; this is the first-line imaging test for suspected acute PE in most adults, replacing invasive pulmonary angiography in routine practice [^5acd6e44] [^1310846e] [^d7e4d745].

> Wait, let me verify the technical protocol so I don't gloss over important details. Modern CTPA relies on multidetector CT with thin collimation, rapid contrast bolus, and careful timing to achieve pulmonary arterial enhancement of roughly 200–250 Hounsfield units; dose-optimization strategies such as kV reduction, iterative reconstruction, and high-pitch modes are used to maintain image quality while minimizing radiation and contrast, and in select scenarios a combined CTPA/CTV study can evaluate for DVT in the same session, though this adds radiation and contrast and should be used judiciously [^13d4e34d] [^4cdcbbb3] [^00d877b4].

> I should confirm diagnostic performance and the meaning of a negative result. In patients with low or intermediate pretest probability, a high-quality negative CTPA effectively rules out clinically significant PE, with sensitivity around 95–100% and specificity around 89–98%; in high pretest probability, sensitivity is lower, about 85–95%, so a negative CTPA may not suffice and additional testing can be considered if clinical suspicion remains high [^a09ac913] [^5acd6e44] [^426913b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering CTPA for everyone. I need to check guideline-based algorithms. For low pretest probability, PERC can obviate testing if all criteria are negative; if PERC is positive or pretest probability is intermediate, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is used, with CTPA reserved for positive results; for high pretest probability, proceed directly to CTPA without D-dimer, and if imaging is delayed, consider interim anticoagulation while awaiting results [^829b3716] [^d6c2e65a] [^d72d989a].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I initially thought CTPA might be contraindicated in pregnancy, but wait, I should double-check the radiation risk. Fetal radiation from thoracic CTPA is extremely low, around 0.02 mGy, and both CTPA and V/Q are considered acceptable; many guidelines prefer V/Q when available because it avoids maternal breast radiation, though CTPA is reasonable if V/Q is unavailable or if the chest radiograph is abnormal, and a pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm can safely reduce imaging in a substantial fraction of patients [^7ce7fec1] [^bb0950d3] [^371dc233].

> Next, I should review pediatrics. Children have a much lower incidence of PE and D-dimer has poor specificity, so routine D-dimer is not recommended; when PE is strongly suspected, CTPA is the diagnostic test of choice, ideally with low-dose protocols to minimize radiation, and lower-extremity ultrasound can be considered given the high rate of concurrent DVT, though a negative ultrasound does not exclude PE [^676197fc] [^75139765].

> I will now examine alternatives when CTPA is contraindicated or unavailable. Ventilation–perfusion scanning remains appropriate, particularly with renal impairment, contrast allergy, or pregnancy, and modern V/Q techniques such as SPECT or SPECT/CT improve diagnostic yield; if V/Q is nondiagnostic, proximal leg ultrasound can be used to look for DVT, and in select unstable patients, bedside echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography can support the diagnosis of central PE when transport is risky [^832f9761] [^692ef4cf] [^4f610c4f].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is broader than PE alone. Triple-rule-out CT can evaluate PE, aortic disease, and coronary disease in a single study, but I need to ensure we don't overuse it; radiation is higher and yield is low unless there is a compelling need to evaluate multiple vascular beds simultaneously, so it should be reserved for carefully selected cases rather than routine practice [^2ea8637d] [^440af51e].

> I should double-check the issue of overuse and incidental findings, because this affects test selection. CTPA utilization has risen dramatically while yield has fallen, and incidental findings are common but rarely change management; adhering to pretest probability assessment, PERC, and D-dimer strategies can safely reduce unnecessary CTPA without missing clinically significant PE, and clinical decision support improves appropriate use and yield [^c26811ca] [^8c1ee5c5] [^f0fe562c].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. The type of CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism is a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography using a multidetector scanner with thin slices, optimized contrast timing, and dose-reduction techniques; when performed and interpreted properly, a negative CTPA in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability safely excludes PE, whereas in high pretest probability a negative CTPA may require additional testing or close follow-up if suspicion remains high [^5acd6e44] [^a09ac913] [^426913b6].

The test to rule out pulmonary embolism is a **CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** [^5acd6e44], which is the first-line imaging modality for suspected PE because it provides high sensitivity and specificity [^a09ac913] and rapid results [^b6517204]. CTPA directly visualizes pulmonary arteries for emboli and can identify alternative diagnoses [^d7e4d745]; however, it requires iodinated contrast and radiation exposure, so use should be guided by pretest probability [^b8e31177] and clinical judgment [^6cc7f548]. In patients with contraindications to CTPA (e.g. contrast allergy, severe renal impairment, pregnancy), a ventilation-perfusion scan or MRI is recommended [^832f9761] [^7ce7fec1].

---

## Indications for CTPA

CTPA is indicated in patients with **intermediate or high pretest probability** of PE [^b8e31177], or when D-dimer is positive in low-probability patients [^f040625c]. It is also used when alternative diagnoses (e.g. aortic dissection, coronary artery disease) must be excluded [^440af51e].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

Contraindications include **severe contrast allergy**, **severe renal impairment**, and **pregnancy** (especially first trimester) [^7ce7fec1]. Limitations include radiation exposure, contrast-related nephropathy, and false positives/negatives due to suboptimal technique or small emboli [^c1db5e6f].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

When CTPA is contraindicated or unavailable, **alternatives include**:

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan | - Contrast allergy <br/> - Severe renal impairment <br/> - Pregnancy | - Lower sensitivity/specificity <br/> - Nondiagnostic in many cases [^a09ac913] |
| Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) | - Contrast allergy <br/> - Pregnancy | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time [^notfound] |
| Echocardiography | - Hemodynamic instability <br/> - Bedside use | - Limited sensitivity <br/> - Operator-dependent [^4f610c4f] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize using **clinical prediction rules** (Wells, Geneva, PERC) [^6cc7f548] to guide testing [^b8e31177]. For high pretest probability, proceed directly to CTPA [^d72d989a]; for low probability, use D-dimer before imaging [^f040625c]. In pregnancy, use a pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm to reduce radiation exposure [^bb0950d3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line test**: CTPA for suspected PE [^5acd6e44].
- **Use clinical prediction rules**: to guide testing [^6cc7f548].
- **Consider alternatives**: V/Q scan or MRA when CTPA is contraindicated [^832f9761] [^7ce7fec1].
- **Balance risks and benefits**: contrast, radiation, and false results [^c1db5e6f].

CTPA is the **preferred test** to rule out PE, but use should be guided by pretest probability and patient-specific factors to minimize harm and maximize diagnostic yield [^5acd6e44].

### State-of-the-art pulmonary CT angiography for acute pulmonary embolism [^b6517204]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging modality of choice in suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Current pulmonary CTA techniques involve ever lower doses of contrast medium and radiation along with advanced postprocessing applications to enhance image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and provide added value in patient management. The objective of this article is to summarize these current developments and discuss the appropriate use of state-of-the-art pulmonary CTA.

Conclusion

Pulmonary CTA is well established as a fast and reliable means of excluding or diagnosing PE. Continued developments in CT system hardware and postprocessing techniques will allow incremental reductions in radiation and contrast material requirements while improving image quality. Advances in risk stratification and prognostication from pulmonary CTA examinations should further refine its clinical value while minimizing the potential harm from overutilization and overdiagnosis.

### The impact of clinical decision rules on computed tomography Use and yield for pulmonary embolism: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^a4021df0]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Validation studies have confirmed the accuracy of clinical decision rules for the evaluation of pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. It has been assumed that clinical decision rules will also decrease testing in actual practice, but the evidence for this is unclear. We perform a systematic review of impact analyses on clinical decision rules for pulmonary embolism.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched without language restriction for studies assessing the effect of clinical decision rules on efficiency (computed tomography [CT] angiography use and yield) and safety (missed pulmonary embolism) through October 2014. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, methods, risk of bias, and outcomes.

Results

Eight studies (n = 6,677) contained sufficient information, including 1 randomized trial and 7 observational studies. Because of heterogeneity, the results of 4 studies of moderate to high quality assessing the Wells criteria were pooled. The pooled CT angiography yield was 9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 12%) in the control group and 12% (95% CI 11% to 14%) in the intervention group, for a 3% increase in yield (95% CI 1% to 5%), relative risk 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.6). We were unable to report a pooled estimate of CT angiography use. Of 2 studies with sufficient information, there was no difference in the rate of missed pulmonary embolism between intervention and control groups. No studies used a cluster-randomized design.

Conclusion

Among participants with suspected pulmonary embolism, implementation of the Wells criteria was associated with a modest increase in CT angiography yield. There is a lack of cluster-randomized trials to confirm the efficacy of clinical decision rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

### The role of multidetector computed tomography angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^947103b1]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

From a radiological point of view, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has effectively become the de-facto first-line imaging test for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE), as patients with a high-quality negative CTPA do not require further examination or treatment for suspected PE. We are likely to see further technical developments in CT technology in the near future. These advances will most likely further improve image quality. Several questions or issues remain, including strategies for further imaging when CT is inconclusive or contraindicated, issues regarding radiation exposure, the prevalence of PE in specific populations, best tests and pathways in specific patient groups, including patients with specific comorbidities such as oncology patients or patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Also, the question whether all PE patients need anticoagulation, the clinical effect of follow-up imaging, and the accuracy of different clinical prediction rules, remains.

### MDCT for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^998c4dde]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

With the advent of multidetector CT, pulmonary CT angiography (MD-CTPA) has substantially gained in spatial resolution and is the accepted method of choice to diagnose and rule out acute pulmonary embolism down to the subsegmental level. This article reviews means to optimize scanning technique and contrast injection protocols dependent on the scanner type used. It summarizes recent publications on the performance of MD-CTPA with special emphasis on the diagnostic accuracy, interpretation and clinical role of (isolated) peripheral emboli. Diagnostic algorithms are outlined that describe the role of CT in context with the pretest probability, the D-Dimer, lower limb sonography and scintigraphy.

### Pulmonary artery CTA [^c8e4b756]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The latest with the introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), CT has been firmly established as the modality of choice for imaging the pulmonary arteries, particularly as the de facto first line test for imaging patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Before the introduction of MDCT, remaining concerns regarding CTs accuracy for diagnosis of isolated peripheral emboli had prevented the unanimous acceptance of this test as the reference standard for imaging PE. After a decade of uncertainty, there is now conclusive evidence that CT, if positive, provides reliable confirmation of the presence of PE and, more importantly, if negative effectively rules out clinically significant PE. Current endeavors to streamline and facilitate workflow for CT diagnosis of PE will further improve the acceptance, utility, and importance of this test. Examples include improvements in workflow, CT derivation of right ventricular function parameters for triage and prognostication of patients with acute PE and the comprehensive assessment of patients with acute chest pain for PE, coronary disease, aortic disease, and pulmonary disease by means of a single, contrast enhanced, ECG-synchronized CT scan. Although the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE is the most common and important application of CT pulmonary angiography, the ease of scan acquisition and the high spatial resolution of modern CT techniques make this test ideally suited for the greatest majority of congenital and acquired, acute and chronic disorders of the pulmonary arteries.

### CT imaging in acute pulmonary embolism: diagnostic strategies [^fb06bfae]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTA) has increasingly become accepted as a widely available, safe, cost-effective, and accurate method for a quick and comprehensive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary catheter angiography is still considered the gold standard and final imaging method in many diagnostic algorithms. However, spiral CTA has become established as the first imaging test in clinical routine due to its high negative predictive value for clinically relevant PE. Despite the direct visualization of clot material, depiction of cardiac and pulmonary function in combination with the quantification of pulmonary obstruction helps to grade the severity of PE for further risk stratification and to monitor the effect of thrombolytic therapy. Because PE and deep venous thrombosis are two different aspects of the same disease, additional indirect CT venography may be a valuable addition to the initial diagnostic algorithm-if this was positive for PE-and demonstration of the extent and localization of deep venous thrombosis has an impact on clinical management. Additional and alternate diagnoses add to the usefulness of this method. Using advanced multislice spiral CT technology, some practitioners have advocated CTA as the sole imaging tool for routine clinical assessment in suspected acute PE. This will simplify standards of practice in the near future.

### How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism [^f69e39fc]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are a-specific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure, several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, and over diagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm. This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^1310846e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — talking points for clinicians to use with patients during PE evaluation: Imaging has risks. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria exclude PE in patients with low pretest probability. D-dimer testing excludes PE in patients at low pretest probability who do not meet the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria or patients at intermediate pretest probability. Alternative diagnostic strategies exist for patients who cannot have CT.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^a09ac913]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^8e59c02f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our data indicate that search for an alternate radiologic diagnosis does not justify what appears to be an indiscriminate use of CTPA. CTPA is being increasingly used as the first and only diagnostic test for suspected PE and the frequency of positive CTPAs has declined significantly over time, with younger and healthier patients being tested.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^b8e31177]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### CT pulmonary angiography of adult pulmonary vascular diseases: technical considerations and interpretive pitfalls [^d24fbf2f]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the primary imaging modality for evaluating the pulmonary arteries. Although pulmonary embolism is the primary indication for CTPA, various pulmonary vascular abnormalities can be detected in adults. Knowledge of these disease entities and understanding technical pitfalls that can occur when performing CTPA are essential to enable accurate diagnosis and allow timely management. This review will cover a spectrum of acquired abnormalities including pulmonary embolism due to thrombus and foreign bodies, primary and metastatic tumor involving the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary hypertension, as well as pulmonary artery aneurysms and stenoses. Additionally, methods to overcome technical pitfalls and interventional treatment options will be addressed.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: policy statement [^75139765]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound can be considered as a first-line test in patients with concern for a deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism (PE). A positive ultrasound may allow for presumptive diagnosis of PE in the appropriate clinical scenario; however, a negative ultrasound study is insufficient to exclude the diagnosis, and depending on the pretest probability, CT would be appropriate. CT pulmonary angiogram is the diagnostic test of choice when there is high clinical suspicion for PE, and low-radiation dosing protocols are important to minimize radiation exposure. Clinicians should consider risk factors and clinical presentation to risk-stratify patients, as decision tools, including the Wells Criteria and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria, have not been validated in children.

### Computer-assisted detection of pulmonary embolism: evaluation of pulmonary CT angiograms performed in an on-call setting [^dbf5ed4a]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the most frequent potentially fatal diseases. Unfortunately, because of its unspecific clinical symptoms, pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose clinically. In two-thirds of the cases the diagnosis is missed if no additional diagnostic procedures are carried out.

The diagnostic imaging method of choice for the detection of PE in most institutions is contrast-enhanced pulmonary multidetector CT angiography (CTPA). However, each CTPA examination produces on average 300–500 axial images. Thin sections need to be reviewed because it is known that small emboli can be missed on thick sections. Meticulous review of all CT slices is therefore time-consuming and requires a high level of attentiveness. The prevalence of PE in patients sent to CTPA is moderate to low, in the range of 10–35% according to current literature. The chance of missing small emboli increases with time pressure and anatomical and technical complexity and decreases as readers become more experienced.

Computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms have been developed to help exclude pulmonary embolism and to improve the detection performance of observers. The purpose of this study was to assess the stand-alone performance of a computer-assisted detection (CAD) prototype on evaluation of pulmonary CT angiograms (CTPA) performed in an on-call setting. Performance of the CAD algorithm as a stand-alone system was compared with a reference standard and the original reports.

### Newer diagnostic modalities for pulmonary embolism. pulmonary angiography using CT and MR imaging compared with conventional angiography [^5a9a9af3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

CTPA is a highly sensitive and excellent primary method for evaluating patients with symptoms of PE. Ongoing studies will demonstrate the good clinical outcome of patients with negative CTPA results. The ability to visualize the lung parenchyma in addition to the pulmonary vasculature, and the smaller number of nondiagnostic scans, make CT more cost effective than V/Q scans, and CT therefore should be used as a first-line evaluation. MR imaging is a continually developing modality with more imaging options that could make it an invaluable or adjunctive test in the near future.

### Targeting the initial investigation and management in cases of acute pulmonary embolism [^d6c2e65a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has a > 10% mortality rate in the early stages if left untreated. Patients presenting with the symptom complex including pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and evidence of venous thromboembolic disease may warrant investigation. A serum d-dimer measurement has high sensitivity and low specificity and thus is useful for ruling out PE as a cause of these symptoms if the diagnosis is unlikely. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is both sensitive and specific and is thus ideal for definitive diagnosis of PE. CTPA is limited by a lack of resources and the high dose of radiation required for this test.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases (published June 2012) advises the use of a 2-level Well's score to determine which of these diagnostic tests is required. A low score (unlikely PE) should be investigated with d-dimer first, and CTPA in the event of a positive d-dimer. A high score (likely PE) should be investigated with a CTPA as soon as possible. In either case, if a CTPA is indicated but has been delayed, an interim therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be given.

Close adherence to this guideline is important for quality of care for several reasons:

Patients with likely PE who have an inappropriate d-dimer test will delay treatment with LMWH significantly. Urgent blood tests can take more than one hour from deciding to take the sample to having the result
Efficiently ruling out PE in patients allows for timely investigation of alternative diagnoses
Needless d-dimer tests in patients with high Well's scores is a waste of resources. Likewise, any CTPA without preceding d-dimer test in cases of low likelihood PE is both a waste of resources and a large inappropriate dose of radiation.

### Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria reduces the need for CT… [^224f3a45]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Can the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria clinical decision rule reduce the need for computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in low-risk patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Bottom Line Use of the PERC clinical decision rule significantly reduces the need for CT pulmonary angiography in adults with an initial low-risk clinical estimate of suspected PE. Synopsis The PERC decision rule is an eight-item set of clinical criteria, including arterial oxygen saturation of 94% or less, pulse rate of at least 100 beats per minute, patient age at least 50 years, unilateral leg swelling, hemoptysis, recent trauma or surgery, prior PE or deep venous thrombosis, and exogenous estrogen use.

These investigators identified all consenting adults who presented to an emergency department with new-onset presence or worsening of shortness of breath or chest pain and a low clinical probability of PE. The patients were cluster-randomized based on emergency department location to a control group or to an intervention group with a diagnostic workup that included an initial calculation of the PERC score. Patients who scored zero had no additional workup for PE. Patients with a PERC score above zero had a standard diagnostic workup that included d-dimer testing, followed by CT pulmonary angiography if the d-dimer result was positive. The control group received only the standard workup without a preceding PERC calculation.

The intervention strategy continued for six months, followed by a two-month washout period, and then the two groups crossed over to the other diagnostic strategy protocol. Individuals who assessed outcomes remained masked to group assignments. Follow-up occurred for 97% of patients at three months. Using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients in the PERC group who were given an initial diagnosis of PE compared with patients in the control group. Only one PE was diagnosed during follow-up in the PERC group; none were diagnosed in the control group. CT pulmonary angiography occurred in significantly fewer patients in the PERC group than in the control group.

### Suspected pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis: a comprehensive MDCT diagnosis in the acute clinical setting [^00d877b4]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Both pulmonary arterial and peripheral venous sides of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can now be efficiently and safely investigated by multi-detector CT (MDCT) at the same time by a combined CT angiography/CT venography protocol. In the emergency setting, the use of such a single test for patients suspected of suffering from VTE on a clinical grounds may considerably shorten and simplify diagnostic algorithms. The selection of patients to be submitted to MDCT must follow well-established clinical prediction rules in order to avoid generalized referral to CT on a generic clinical suspicion basis and excessive population exposure to increased ionizing radiation dose, especially in young patients. Clinical and anatomical wide-panoramic capabilities of MDCT allow identification of underlying disease that may explain patients' symptoms in a large number of cases in which VTE is not manifest. The analysis of MDCT additional findings on cardiopulmonary status and total thrombus burden can lead to better prognostic stratification of patients and influence therapeutic options. Some controversial points such as optimal examination parameters, clinical significance of subsegmentary emboli, CT pitfalls and/or possible falsely positive diagnoses, and outcome of untreated patients in which VTE has been excluded by MDCT without additional testing, must of course be taken into careful consideration before the definite role of comprehensive MDCT VTE "one-stop-shop" diagnosis in everyday clinical practice can be ascertained.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^d72d989a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### The negative predictive value of spiral computed tomography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients with nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion scans [^afdc51fe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There is no noninvasive method to rule out pulmonary embolism when the clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism is high. We did a prospective observational study to determine the negative predictive value of spiral computed tomography (CT) in this situation.

Methods

We performed spiral CT scans of the thorax in consecutive patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism with intermediate or low probability ventilation-perfusion scans. Patients with negative or indeterminate spiral CT results had conventional angiography at the discretion of the attending physician. Only patients with positive spiral CT results or positive conventional angiograms were treated. All patients were observed for 6 months for evidence of venous thromboembolic disease. Clinical outcome without treatment or the results of conventional angiography were used as reference standards. False-negative results were defined as a negative spiral CT with a positive conventional angiogram or any diagnosis of venous thromboembolism within 6 months.

Results

Among the 103 patients who were studied, spiral CT scans were positive in 22 patients, indeterminate in 10 patients, and negative in 71 patients. Twenty-seven (26%) patients had pulmonary embolism by clinical outcome, including 3 of the 71 patients with negative spiral CT scans and 2 of the 10 patients with indeterminate scans. A negative spiral CT result had a likelihood ratio of 0.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.04 to 0.35) with a negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI: 88% to 99%). Using conventional angiography only as the reference standard, a negative spiral CT result had a likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.31) and a negative predictive value of 93% (95% CI: 77% to 98%).

Conclusions

Spiral CT has a high negative predictive value for pulmonary embolism and may replace conventional angiography in the workup of pulmonary embolism. Patients with indeterminate spiral CT results should be considered for conventional angiography.

### Adherence to PIOPED II investigators' recommendations for computed tomography pulmonary angiography [^27d50a0a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography use has increased dramatically, raising concerns for patient safety. Adherence to recommendations and guidelines may protect patients. We measured adherence to the recommendations of Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED II) investigators for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism and the rate of potential false-positive pulmonary embolism diagnoses when recommendations of PIOPED II investigators were not followed.

Methods

We used a structured record review to identify 3500 consecutive CT pulmonary angiograms performed to investigate suspected pulmonary embolism in 2 urban emergency departments, calculating the revised Geneva score (RGS) to classify patients as "pulmonary embolism unlikely" (RGS ≤ 10) or "pulmonary embolism likely" (RGS > 10). CT pulmonary angiograms were concordant with PIOPED II investigator recommendations if pulmonary embolism was likely or pulmonary embolism was unlikely and a highly sensitive D-dimer test result was positive. We independently reviewed 482 CT pulmonary angiograms to measure the rate of potential false-positive pulmonary embolism diagnoses.

Results

A total of 1592 of 3500 CT pulmonary angiograms (45.5%) followed the recommendations of PIOPED II investigators. The remaining 1908 CT pulmonary angiograms were performed on patients with an RGS ≤ 10 without a D-dimer test (n = 1588) or after a negative D-dimer test result (n = 320). The overall rate of pulmonary embolism was 9.7%. Potential false-positive diagnoses of pulmonary embolism occurred in 2 of 3 patients with an RGS ≤ 10 and a negative D-dimer test result.

Conclusions

Nonadherence to recommendations for CT pulmonary angiography is common and exposes patients to increased risks, including potential false-positive diagnoses of pulmonary embolism.

### Optimizing CT pulmonary angiogram utilization in a community emergency department: a pre-and postintervention study [^5a87aea4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Optimizing the utilization of CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) for the diagnosis and workup of acute chest pain can provide an opportunity to reduce unnecessary radiation and health care system expense.

Methods

An attempt to improve CTPA utilization began by measuring overall department and clinician-specific utilization. This was bolstered by retrospectively evaluating patient charts for pulmonary embolism scoring criteria and D-dimer utilization so as to better understand gaps in diagnostic workup. The department-wide and individualized metrics were then provided to each emergency department clinician and differences between the pre- and postintervention data were evaluated.

Results

The percentage of positive CTPAs did not change significantly at 8.7% and 9.2% in the pre- and postintervention groups, respectively. Similarly, the workup of patients based on retrospective PERC and Wells-score criteria did not significantly improve after the intervention. However, the percentage of CTPAs ordered on low D-dimer patients did decrease significantly post-intervention. Further observational analysis uncovered marked variability in clinician ordering behavior and diagnostic rates.

Conclusions

Overall, such an intervention seems to have a limited, though not insignificant, impact on the workup of suspected pulmonary embolism. Calculating provider-specific utilization metrics allows both the radiologist and clinician to better understand opportunities to improve health care delivery.

### Don't perform chest CT (CT angiography) to evaluate for… [^d209b415]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for pulmonary embolism indicate that the cost and potential harms of CT angiography outweigh the benefits for patients with a low pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. In patients with a low clinical prediction score followed by a negative D-dimer measured with a high sensitivity test, pulmonary embolism is effectively excluded and no further imaging is indicated for pulmonary embolism evaluation.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^ff6fc91d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method to confirm or exclude a PE. However the non-selective use of CTPA has several disadvantages. These include long term risks of exposure to high doses of radiation and a small but definite risk of kidney injury due to intravenous contrast. Moreover, CTPA is an expensive test and often leaves behind a trail of incidental findings of indeterminate implication that further increase health care costs. Even with CTPA's technological advances, easy availability and ever shorter scan times, the assessment of clinical pre-test probability remains central to the diagnosis of PE and ideally should influence the initial choice of diagnostic testing. However, it remains unclear how frequently pre-test probability algorithms are followed in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, while the number of CTPA has increased dramatically, the majority of CTPA do not show the presence of PE. Nevertheless, the increase in the use of CTPA is often justified by the discovery of hitherto unknown pathological etiologies; however, review of the literature would indicate that this has not been rigorously examined. In this study we examined the patterns of CTPA use over an eleven year period at a single center and assessed whether the use of CTPA was justified in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability by the finding of an alternative diagnosis that might have explained the patient's symptoms.

### CT angiography in the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolus [^1feef00b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the appropriate use of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

Materials and Methods

We reviewed a total of 575 CT angiograms obtained to evaluate for PE at a large level 1 trauma teaching hospital from January 2004 through March 2005. Various clinical settings were used for 267 inpatient (46%), 258 emergency department (45%), and 50 outpatient (9%) studies. We excluded CTA performed for other reasons, repeated CTA, and patient records with incomplete clinical data. On the basis of chart review in which the investigators were blinded to final diagnoses, pretest probability of PE according to the Wells criteria was retrospectively assigned to each patient. D-dimer values, when obtained, also were reviewed. The diagnosis of PE was based on final CTA reports.

Results

PE was diagnosed in 9.57% of 575 patients. Positivity rates by location were 32 (12%) of the 267 inpatients, 22 (8.5%) of the 258 emergency department patients, and one (2.0%) of the 50 outpatients. Three (< 1%) of the 575 patients had high probability of PE, even though 351 patients had gone directly to CTA. Of the other 572 patients, 158 (28%) had intermediate and 414 (72%) low probability of PE. In the high, intermediate, and low probability groups, two (67%), 24 (15%), and 29 (7%), respectively, of the patients had PE. A D-dimer assay was performed for 224 (39%) of the 575 patients. Thirty-nine (17%) of the 224 patients had normal results (< 0.5 microg/mL); 107 (48%), intermediate results (0.6–2.0 microg/mL); and 78 (35%), abnormal results (> 2.0 microg/mL). In the emergency department cohort, 151 (59%) of 258 patients underwent a D-dimer assay. Thirty-two (21%) of the 151 patients had normal results; 81 (54%), intermediate results; and 38 (25%), abnormal results. Only one patient with a normal D-dimer level and three patients with intermediate D-dimer levels had PE, the equivalent of 3% of each group. The number of CTA examinations ordered for patients with normal and intermediate D-dimer results was 146 (25% of the 575 total studies). Twenty-two (8%) of the 258 emergency department patients had PE, and clinical suspicion of PE was high for 11 (50%), intermediate for 10 (45%), and low for one (5%) of those patients.

Conclusion

Our data showed suboptimal use of the Wells criteria and subjective overestimation of the probability of PE before ordering of CTA. Although a definitive acceptable PE positivity rate for CTA has not been established, the 10% yield represents overuse of CTA as a screening rather than a diagnostic examination.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^3bfb7617]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### Use of multislice CT for the evaluation of emergency room patients with chest pain: the so-called "triple rule-out" [^440af51e]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) technology have made high resolution noninvasive coronary angiograms possible. Multiple studies involving over 2,000 patients have established that coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is highly accurate for delineation of the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The high negative predictive value (> 95%) found in these studies suggests that CCTA is an attractive option for exclusion of coronary artery disease in properly selected emergency department patients with acute chest pain. CT is also a well established and accurate tool for the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism. Recent technical developments now permit acquisition of well-opacified images of the coronary arteries, thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries from a single CT scan. While this so called "triple-rule out" scan protocol can potentially exclude fatal causes of chest pain in all three vascular beds, the attendant higher radiation dose of this method precludes its routine use except when there is sufficient support for the diagnosis of either aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism. This article provides an overview of CCTA, and reviews the clinical evidence supporting the use of this technique for triage of patients with acute chest pain.

### CT pulmonary angiography: using decision rules in the emergency department [^158515ed]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness of utilization and diagnostic yields of CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), comparing two commonly applied decision rules, the pulmonary embolism (PE) rule-out criteria (PERC) and the modified Wells criteria (mWells), in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant, prospective-cohort, academic single-center study. Six hundred two consecutive adult ED patients undergoing CTPA for suspected PE formed the study population. The outcome was positive or negative for PE by CTPA and at 6-month follow-up. PERC and mWells scores were calculated. A positive PERC score was defined as meeting one or more criteria and a positive mWells score as > 4. The percentage of CT pulmonary angiographic examinations that could have been avoided and the diagnostic yield of CTPA using PERC, mWells, and PERC applied to a negative mWells score were calculated.

Results

The diagnostic yield of CTPA was 10% (61 of 602). By applying PERC, mWells, and PERC to negative mWells score, 17.6% (106 of 602), 45% (273 of 602), and 17.1% (103 of 602) of CT pulmonary angiographic examinations, respectively, could have been avoided. The diagnostic yield in PERC-positive patients was higher than in mWells-positive patients (10% [59 of 602] vs 8% [49 of 602], P < .0001). Among PERC-negative and mWells-negative patients, the diagnostic yields for PE were 1.9% (2 of 106) and 4% (12 of 273), respectively (P = 0.004). The diagnostic yield of a negative PERC score applied to a negative mWells score was 1.9% (2 of 103).

Conclusions

The use of PERC in the ED has the potential to significantly reduce the utilization of CTPA and misses fewer cases of PE compared with mWells, and it is therefore a more efficient decision tool.

### High-pitch CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with ultra-low contrast medium volume for the detection of pulmonary embolism: a comparison with standard CTPA [^4cdcbbb3]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial embolism (PE) is the third most frequent acute cardiovascular disease (estimated annual incidence: 39–200 per 100,000 inhabitants), being second only to myocardial infarction and stroke. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of this potentially acutely or chronically life-threatening disease is crucial for the adequate management in order to improve patients' prognosis. However, over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment needs to be avoided.

For several decades, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE due to its high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (96%), availability, and short examination time. Additionally, CTPA may render an alternative diagnosis, if PE is ruled out.

It is well known that ionizing radiation may be harmful and 2% of all newly diagnosed neoplasia have been reported to be a result of radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT). Intravenous iodinated contrast medium may cause contrast-induced nephropathy and has been reported to amplify DNA radiation damage during CT. Despite the potential risks, CT imaging with iodinated contrast medium is indispensable for many CT applications, including vascular CT angiography and CTPA in particular.

So far, there have been numerous studies investigating scan protocols to optimize radiation dose or contrast medium volume without compromising image quality or diagnostic feasibility. For radiation dose, the most effective strategy has been to decrease tube potential, but also lowering tube current and using the high-pitch mode in dual-source CT scanners have been explored. Scanning in high-pitch mode may reduce oversampling and shortens image acquisition time. Furthermore, image acquisition in high-pitch mode may mitigate or avoid motion artifacts without compromising image quality.

Motion artifacts frequently occur in patients with shortness of breath or chest pain, who have difficulty holding their breath. Elderly individuals frequently have hearing or visual impairments that may also lead to a limited compliance during examination.

To mitigate the outlined challenges and risks during CTPA, some studies have combined more than one of these approaches (low tube voltage, high-pitch, low contrast medium volume) for the detection of PE.

In this study, we investigated a CTPA protocol using ultra-fast high-pitch mode (pitch: 3.2), ultra-low contrast volume administration (20 mL), with kVp and tube current adaptation in normal weight, free-breathing patients for the detection of PE. The aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of this protocol in comparison to a standard CTPA in an emergency care setting.

### Pulmonary embolus imaging with multislice CT [^a9b19ad0]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Multiple data support the concept that single-slice and multislice CT have fundamentally modified the diagnostic approach of patients with suspected PE. Although the definitive role of spiral CT angiography in the diagnostic algorithm has yet to be determined, it is clear that CT angiography has numerous advantages compared with other diagnostic tests. Bearing in mind that an effective diagnostic strategy should be as flexible as possible to be applied in every clinical setting, the role of spiral CT angiography in the diagnostic algorithm has to be considered among several practical parameters, such as the experience of the attending physician, degree of severity of the patient's clinical condition, the availability of diagnostic equipment, and specific logistics.

### CTA utilization for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in a tertiary pediatric emergency department [^825e042e]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate changes in the utilization of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for evaluating suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and the positive rate of ancillary for those studies negative for PE in the last 13 years.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of patient ≤ 20 years of age who underwent a chest CT angiography to rule out PE was performed in a 13-year-period. CT angiographies were grouped into three categories: Positive for PE, negative for PE and positive for ancillary findings, and negative for any pathology. From the exams with ancillary findings, we examined how many of these had a chest radiograph perform within 24 h prior to the CTA and how many of them had an impression stating the same conclusion as the CTA.

Results

307 chest CT angiographies for suspected PE were included. 50 (16%) were reported as positive for PE and 91 (30%) were negative for PE but positive for ancillary findings. The most frequent ancillary findings were pneumonia (n = 26) and pleural effusion (n = 11). Out of 91, 73 patients had a previous chest radiograph and 28 of them reported a similar diagnosis than the CTA. The number of CT angiographies indicated for PE increased by 3.2 studies per year. The rate of CT angiographies positive for ancillary findings (slope = 1.5) and positive for PE (slope = 0.3) remained similar throughout the same period.

Conclusions

CTA orders for PE have been increasing without any increased detection of PE or ancillary findings in children.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^710e686a]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

CTPA has a sensitivity of 96–100% and a specificity of 89–98% in diagnosing probable PE. CTPA has several significant benefits that contribute to its general acceptance. The main advantages of this procedure are its accessibility, little invasiveness, and rapidimaging time. CTPA's field of view extends beyond just the pulmonary arteries, which allows the visualization of various causes of shortness of breath and chest pain, including musculoskeletal injuries, pneumonia, pericardial abnormalities, and vascular pathologies. Moreover, if a CTPA is normal in patients with low or intermediate clinical likelihood, the diagnosis of PE can be excluded without further testing. Stepping outside of its benefits we should consider that excessive testing for PE is a significant health issue, particularly at university hospitals. At one center, if the Revised Geneva Score was used, an estimated 9.84% of CTPA could have been avoided. Although improvements in procedures and techniques can optimize diagnostic accuracy while reducing radiation exposure, the primary issue associated with utilizing CT scans is the potential danger of cancer due to ionizing radiation, particularly in young female patients or patients that are frequently seen for recurrent chest pain. Nonetheless, Woo et al. demonstrated a notable benefit-to-risk ratio of CTPA by considering the mean lifetime attributable risk of cancer death. Furthermore, CTPA is conducted using intravenous contrast agents, which can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy, but is much less common than previously thought, but can rarely happen with impaired renal function. For current low-osmolar and iso-osmolar contrast materials, the risk of other adverse events, associated with intravenous iodinated contrast is minimal, falling between 0.2% and 0.7%.

### Follow-up CT pulmonary angiograms in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^e8c7f3e5]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Computed tomographic (CT) angiography is associated with a non-negligible lifetime attributable risk of cancer. The risk is considerably greater for women and younger patients. Recognizing that there are risks from radiation, the purpose of this investigation was to assess the frequency of follow-up CT angiograms in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients aged ≥ 18 years with acute pulmonary embolism seen in three emergency departments from January 2013 to December 2014. Records of all patients were reviewed for at least 14 months. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by CT angiography in 600 patients. At least one follow-up CT angiogram in 1 year was obtained in 141 of 600 (23.5%). Two follow-ups in 1 year were obtained in 40 patients (6.7%), 3 follow-ups were obtained in 15 patients (2.5%), and 4 follow-ups were obtained in 3 patients (0.5%). Among young women (aged ≤ 29 years) with pulmonary embolism, 10 of 21 (47.6%) had at least 1 follow-up and 4 of 21 (19.0%) had 2 or more follow-ups in 1 year. Among all patients, recurrent pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 15 of 141 (10.6%) on the first follow-up CT angiogram and in 6 of 40 (15.0%) on the second follow-up. Follow-up CT angiograms were obtained in a significant proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism, including young women, the group with the highest risk. Alternative options might be considered to reduce the hazard of radiation-induced cancer, particularly in young women.

### Simplified diagnostic management of suspected pulmonary embolism (the YEARS study): a prospective, multicentre, cohort study [^0d6a0898]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Validated diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism are often not used correctly or only benefit subgroups of patients, leading to overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The YEARS clinical decision rule that incorporates differential D-dimer cutoff values at presentation, has been developed to be fast, to be compatible with clinical practice, and to reduce the number of CTPA investigations in all age groups. We aimed to prospectively evaluate this novel and simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, cohort study in 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, including consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism between Oct 5, 2013, to July 9, 2015. Patients were managed by simultaneous assessment of the YEARS clinical decision rule, consisting of three items (clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis, haemoptysis, and whether pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis), and D-dimer concentrations. In patients without YEARS items and D-dimer less than 1000 ng/mL, or in patients with one or more YEARS items and D-dimer less than 500 ng/mL, pulmonary embolism was considered excluded. All other patients had CTPA. The primary outcome was the number of independently adjudicated events of venous thromboembolism during 3 months of follow-up after pulmonary embolism was excluded, and the secondary outcome was the number of required CTPA compared with the Wells' diagnostic algorithm. For the primary outcome regarding the safety of the diagnostic strategy, we used a per-protocol approach. For the secondary outcome regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic strategy, we used an intention-to-diagnose approach. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR4193.

Findings

3616 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were screened, of whom 151 (4%) were excluded. The remaining 3465 patients were assessed of whom 456 (13%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at baseline. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out at baseline and remained untreated, 18 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up (0.61%, 95% CI 0.36–0.96) of whom six had fatal pulmonary embolism (0.20%, 0.07–0.44). CTPA was not indicated in 1651 (48%) patients with the YEARS algorithm compared with 1174 (34%) patients, if Wells' rule and fixed D-dimer threshold of less than 500 ng/mL would have been applied, a difference of 14% (95% CI 12–16).

Interpretation

In our study pulmonary embolism was safely excluded by the YEARS diagnostic algorithm in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The main advantage of the YEARS algorithm in our patients is the absolute 14% decrease of CTPA examinations in all ages and across several relevant subgroups.

Funding

This study was supported by unrestricted grants from the participating hospitals.

### Clinical and imaging aspects of pulmonary embolism: a primer for radiologists [^b814e8a5]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many advancements have been made in imaging modalities that can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is still the preferred gold standard for promptly diagnosing pulmonary embolism by looking for filling defects caused by the embolus lodged within the main pulmonary artery or its respective branches. The diagnosis is made by the radiologists in emergency settings where quick detection of a PE on CTPA helps the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) in quick management. Thus, utmost care is needed to follow standard image acquisition protocols and optimal contrast administration techniques to achieve a contrast opacification of at least 210 Hounsfield units for the radiologists to easily pinpoint an embolus within the pulmonary arteries. Even following proper CTPA scan acquisition guidelines, a CTPA image is prone to several artifacts that can be mistaken for a PE, resulting in a false positive read. In addition to this, many incidental findings, that can be the etiology of chest pain in a PE-suspected patient, are often overlooked by emergency radiologists who try to be as quick as possible in their read so that timely management of PE can be ensued. Taking this into account, our review paper provides the audience with a comprehensive understanding of the clinical aspects of pulmonary embolism and the imaging modalities used for PE detection. The main focus is on CTPA, its acquisition protocols, and the various incidental findings and artifacts to look for while interpreting a CTPA scan. PRéCIS: Beyond the filling defects, a CTPA scan should also be assessed by the radiologists for any incidental findings while keeping in mind several associated pitfalls and artifacts of CTPA.

### The PE puzzle: identifying and differentiating mimics of acute and chronic pulmonary embolism on CTPA [^e6875f9a]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and overlapping imaging features with a wide array of conditions. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for diagnosing PE, but technical limitations and mimicking entities may lead to false-positive interpretations. This review highlights key radiologic mimics of acute and chronic PE, grouped into artifacts and slow-flow phenomena, tumoral mimics, pseudo-defects from adjacent structures, and chronic PE mimics. Particular focus is placed on common pitfalls such as motion artifacts, pulmonary artery opacification artifacts, and transient interruption of contrast. We outline distinctive imaging features and offer practical strategies to optimize acquisition protocols and interpretative accuracy, including the use of dual-source CT, ECG-gating, and attenuation-based criteria. Recognizing these mimics is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure appropriate clinical management. This review aims to equip radiologists and trainees with a structured diagnostic framework to improve confidence and accuracy when interpreting CTPA in suspected PE.

### Multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in patients with a high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism [^426913b6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

ESSENTIALS: When high probability of pulmonary embolism (PE), sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) is unclear. We investigated the sensitivity of multidetector CT among 134 patients with a high probability of PE. A normal CT alone may not safely exclude PE in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. In patients with no clear alternative diagnosis after CTPA, further testing should be strongly considered.

Background

Whether patients with a negative multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) result and a high clinical pretest probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) should be further investigated is controversial.

Methods

This was a prospective investigation of the sensitivity of multidetector CTPA among patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE according to the Wells criteria. Among patients with a negative CTPA result, the diagnosis of PE required at least one of the following conditions: ventilation/perfusion lung scan showing a high probability of PE in a patient with no history of PE, abnormal findings on venous ultrasonography in a patient without previous deep vein thrombosis at that site, or the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period after anticoagulation was withheld because of a negative multidetector CTPA result.

Results

We identified 498 patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE and a completed CTPA study. CTPA excluded PE in 134 patients; in these patients, the pooled incidence of VTE was 5.2% (seven of 134 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–9.0). Five patients had VTEs that were confirmed by an additional imaging test despite a negative CTPA result (five of 48 patients; 10.4%; 95% CI 1.8–19.1), and two patients had objectively confirmed VTEs that occurred during clinical follow-up of at least 3 months (two of 86 patients; 2.3%; 95% CI 0–5.5). None of the patients had a fatal PE during follow-up.

Conclusions

A normal multidetector CTPA result alone may not safely exclude PE in patients with a high clinical pretest probability.

### Higher imaging yield when clinical decision support is used [^f0fe562c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Increased utilization of CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism has been associated with decreasing diagnostic yields and rising concerns about the harms of unnecessary testing. The objective of this study was to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) use would be associated with increased imaging yields after controlling for selection bias.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study in the emergency departments of two tertiary care hospitals of all CTPAs performed between August 2015 and September 2018. Providers ordering a CTPA are routed to an optional CDS tool, which allows them to use Wells' Criteria for pulmonary embolism. After propensity score matching, CTPA yield was calculated for the CDS-use and CDS-dismissal groups and stratified by provider type.

Results

A total of 7,367 CTPAs were ordered during the study period. Of those, providers used the CDS tool in 2,568 (35%) cases and did not use the tool in 4,799 (65%) of cases. After propensity score matching, CTPA yield was 11.99% in the CDS-use group and 8.70% in the CDS-dismissal group (P < .001). Attending physicians, residents, and physician assistant CDS users demonstrated a 56.5% (P = 0.006), 38.7% (P = 0.01), and 16.7% (P = 0.03) increased yield compared with those who dismissed the tool, respectively.

Discussion

Diagnostic yield was 38% higher for CTPAs when the provider used the CDS tool, after controlling for selection bias. Yields were higher for every provider type. Further research is needed to discover successful strategies to increase provider use of these important tools.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain with suspected pulmonary embolism — Class 1 recommendations: For stable patients with acute chest pain and high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), computed tomography angiography (CTA) using a PE protocol is recommended (Class 1, Level B-NR); for patients with acute chest pain and possible PE, need for further testing should be guided by pretest probability (Class 1, Level C-EO).

### Is helical CT angiography a better screen for pulmonary embolism? [^b0a5c3b9]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Diagnosis is difficult because the symptoms of pulmonary embolism are vague and nonspecific. In addition, the current "gold standard" for diagnosing pulmonary embolism is pulmonary angiography, an invasive test with a significant incidence of complications that limit its usefulness. The ventilation-perfusion radio-nuclide lung scan has been used as a noninvasive study for pulmonary embolism. The development of helical computed tomographic angiography provides another option in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Blachere and colleagues compared helical CT angiography and ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning as initial tests in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.

During an 18-month period, 216 consecutive patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism were evaluated by helical CT angiography, ventilation-perfusion radio-nuclide lung scan and Doppler sonography of the lower extremities. In addition, clinical information was obtained, including the clinicians' degree of suspicion of pulmonary embolism. Patients with concordance of results from ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scan, helical CT angiography and physician's suspicion underwent pulmonary angiography. Patients who did not have pulmonary embolism on the initial evaluation were followed for at least three months to determine if there was any recurrent thromboembolic event. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 37. 9 percent of the patients evaluated. There was a statistically significant improvement in diagnosing pulmonary embolism with the use of helical CT angiography compared with ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scan.

Helical CT angiography was more sensitive and specific than the ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scan. Helical CT angiography also had higher positive and negative predictive values and a higher degree of interobserver agreement than ventilation-perfusion scan. The authors conclude that helical CT angiography could replace ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning as the initial test in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. Helical CT angiography provided a more accurate diagnosis, thereby reducing the risk of undertreating or overtreating patients with pulmonary embolism.

### Venous thromboembolism in the ICU: main characteristics, diagnosis and thromboprophylaxis [^4f610c4f]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

A chest CT-based approach has now replaced the gold standard pulmonary angiography with equivalent clinical validity to rule out PE. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the imaging reference exam to diagnose PE in the ICU. Multi-detector CT angiography at 1.25 mm collimation thickness is the most sensitive and allows better imaging of segmental and sub-segmental pulmonary arteries. In cases where PE is suspected, multi-detector CT angiography sensitivity ranged between 83 and 100%, and its specificity ranged between 89 and 97%, although this study did not provide specific data for the ICU population. CT scans can also be useful for determining the severity of acute pulmonary embolisms, by evaluating right ventricular dysfunction, which is well correlated with echocardiography findings.

As CTPA requires patients to be transported to the radiology department and in a rather stable state, it cannot be performed in all ICU patients with a clinical suspicion of PE. Moreover, intra-hospital transport may have a negative impact on ventilated critically ill patients. This explains the delayed use of such definitive diagnostic tests in the ICU. Most epidemiologic studies have to be interpreted with caution, as the diagnosis of PE is often based on questionable definitions. We identified only two prospective studies evaluating the rate of PE in critically ill patients with a standardized protocol of CT scans performed in a homogenous consecutive population: one in severe injured trauma patients (24% PE when scanning asymptomatic severe injured patients); and one in mechanically ventilated patients (18.7% PE using a standard imaging protocol to detect PE during CT scan for any other medical reason).

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) could be helpful in the diagnosis of PE at the bedside by looking for right ventricular hypokinesis, increases in right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, or tricuspid regurgitation velocity. Miniati et al. showed that TTE could help to assess the physiological effects of PE but that it fails to identify more than 50% of PE proven on pulmonary angiography. TTE requires better sensitivity for it to be used as a screening test to rule out PE.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) could be useful in PE diagnosis, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients who have predominantly bilateral central PE. This exam is non-invasive, can be done at the bedside, identifies clots and, compared with CT scanning, has very good sensitivity and specificity (80% and 100%, respectively, in Pruszczyk et al.'s study). But TEE has a higher failure rate than CT scans for diagnosis of distal PE.

### Lower prevalence of subsegmental pulmonary embolism after application of the YEARS diagnostic algorithm [^9f52bb06]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of multi‐detector computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), the sensitivity of this diagnostic technique for visualizing smaller pulmonary embolisms (PE) has noticeably advanced. These advances have led to a more frequent detection of filling defects in subsegmental pulmonary arteries – with diameters as small as 2–3 mm – by multi‐detector computed tomography (MDCT) compared to single detector computed tomography (SDCT; Fig 1) (Carrier et al, 2010; Klok & Huisman, 2017). The rate of isolated subsegmental PE (ssPE) diagnosis has doubled since the introduction of the MDCT, from 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5–7.6%) to 9.4% (95% CI: 5.5–14.2%) (Carrier et al, 2010; Konstantinides et al, 2016). Despite this increase in isolated ssPE diagnoses, the risk of fatal PE has remained unchanged, suggesting that not all isolated ssPE may be clinically relevant (Le Gal et al, 2006; Carrier et al, 2010).

Figure 1
Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (arrow) on computed tomography pulmonary angiography.

Recently, a number of studies have been designed to optimize diagnostic strategies for suspected acute PE. Ultimately, they aimed to lower the number of necessary CTPAs, thereby reducing the number of patients exposed to ionizing radiation and simplify diagnostic management in busy clinical practices (den Exter et al, 2013; van der Hulle et al, 2017). The YEARS algorithm involves a D‐dimer test that is combined with three clinical variables, i.e. clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, haemoptysis and "PE most likely diagnosis". In the absence of YEARS items, the D‐dimer threshold to rule out PE without CTPA is 1000 ng/ml and in patients with one or more YEARS items the D‐dimer threshold remains 500 ng/ml. All patients with D‐dimer levels higher than these D‐dimer thresholds require a CTPA examination (Fig 2). We have shown that this algorithm is safe with a failure rate of the overall algorithm of 0.61% (95% CI 0.36–0.96) and a resultant 14% reduction in CTPA examinations compared to the standard algorithm with the conventional Wells rule and fixed D‐dimer threshold of < 500 ng/ml (van der Hulle et al, 2017).

### Trends in imaging for suspected pulmonary embolism across US health care systems, 2004 to 2016 [^c26811ca]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In response to calls to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), there have been growing efforts to create and implement decision rules for PE testing. It is unclear if the use of advanced imaging tests for PE has diminished over time.

Objective

To assess the use of advanced imaging tests, including chest computed tomography (CT) (ie, all chest CT except for CTPA), CTPA, and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, for PE from 2004 to 2016.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study of adults by age group (18–64 years and ≥ 65 years) enrolled in 7 US integrated and mixed-model health care systems. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify years with statistically significant changes in imaging rates and to calculate average annual percentage change (growth) from 2004 to 2007, 2008 to 2011, and 2012 to 2016. Analyses were conducted between June 11, 2019, and March 18, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of chest CT, CTPA, and V/Q scan by year and age, as well as annual change in rates over time.

Results

Overall, 3.6 to 4.8 million enrollees were included each year of the study, for a total of 52 343 517 person-years of follow-up data. Adults aged 18 to 64 years accounted for 42 223 712 person-years (80.7%) and those 65 years or older accounted for 10 119 805 person-years (19.3%). Female enrollees accounted for 27 712 571 person-years (52.9%). From 2004 and 2016, chest CT use increased by 66.3% (average annual growth, 4.4% per year), CTPA use increased by 450.0% (average annual growth, 16.3% per year), and V/Q scan use decreased by 47.1% (decreasing by 4.9% per year). The use of CTPA increased most rapidly from 2004 to 2006 (44.6% in those aged 18–64 years and 43.9% in those ≥ 65 years), with ongoing rapid growth from 2006 to 2010 (annual growth, 19.8% in those aged 18–64 years and 18.3% in those ≥ 65 years) and persistent but slower growth in the most recent years (annual growth, 4.3% in those aged 18–64 years and 3.0% in those ≥ 65 years from 2010 to 2016). The use of V/Q scanning decreased steadily since 2004.

Conclusions and Relevance

From 2004 to 2016, rates of chest CT and CTPA for suspected PE continued to increase among adults but at a slower pace in more contemporary years. Efforts to combat overuse have not been completely successful as reflected by ongoing growth, rather than decline, of chest CT use. Whether the observed imaging use was appropriate or was associated with improved patient outcomes is unknown.

### Clinical usefulness of imaging performed after CT angiography that was negative for pulmonary embolus in a high-risk oncologic population [^5dfb292c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence and types of additional imaging examinations that were performed, and whether anticoagulation therapy was started or continued, after CT angiography showed no pulmonary embolus in a high-risk oncologic population.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the radiology report for each CT angiogram that was obtained for clinically suspected pulmonary embolism at our institution (a tertiary cancer center) during a 25-month period. The radiology information system was then searched for any additional confirmatory radiologic examinations performed within 2 days after a negative finding on CT angiography. Medical records were reviewed to determine whether anticoagulation therapy was started or continued despite a negative finding on CT angiography.

Results

Two hundred seventy-six CT angiograms were obtained in 260 oncology patients who were clinically suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The findings from 203 CT angiograms (74%) were interpreted as negative; 56 (20%), as positive; and 17 (6%), as equivocal for pulmonary embolism. Fifty-eight patients (21%) with negative findings on CT angiography subsequently underwent additional imaging, the results of which were potentially clinically important in 6% of the patients. Six patients began to receive and two continued to undergo anticoagulation therapy despite negative findings on CT angiography; three of the six patients received anticoagulation for new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Conclusion

Negative results of CT angiography for pulmonary embolism did not deter referring physicians from ordering other confirmatory imaging tests in 21% of patients in a high-risk oncologic population. Those additional tests rarely revealed results that might have been clinically important.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism [^4fcb69c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the condition, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered. However, PE will only be confirmed in 10–20% of patients. Because the imaging test of choice, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is costly and associated with radiation exposure and other complications, a validated diagnostic algorithm consisting of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer test should be used to safely exclude PE in 20–30% of patients without the need for CTPA. Recently, the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has been validated, and this has increased the proportion of patients at older age in whom PE can be excluded without CTPA. Initial therapeutic management of PE depends on the risk of short-term PE-related mortality. Haemodynamically unstable patients should be closely monitored and receive thrombolytic therapy unless contraindicated because of an unacceptably high bleeding risk, whereas patients with low-risk PE may be safely discharged early from hospital or receive only outpatient treatment. The PESI score and Hestia decision rule are available to select patients in whom early discharge or outpatient treatment will be safe, although the safety of these strategies should be confirmed in additional studies. Standard PE therapy consists of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, several nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants have been shown to be as effective as LMWH/VKAs, and maybe safer. Determining the optimal duration of treatment for a first unprovoked PE remains a challenge, although clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation-associated haemorrhage are under investigation. Using these prediction rules may lead to both more standardized and more individualized long-term treatment of PE.

### Overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^c5b2717d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical decision rules have been developed and validated for the evaluation of patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) to the emergency department (ED).

Objectives

The objective was to assess the percentage of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) procedures that could have been avoided by use of the Wells score coupled with D-dimer testing (Wells/D-dimer) or pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) in ED patients with suspected PE.

Methods

The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of adult ED patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected PE. Wells score and PERC were calculated. A research blood sample was obtained for D-dimer testing for subjects who did not undergo testing as part of their ED evaluation. The primary outcome was PE by CT-PA or 90-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes were ED length of stay (LOS) and CT-PA time as defined by time from order to initial radiologist interpretation.

Results

Of 152 suspected PE subjects available for analysis (mean ± SD age = 46.3 ± 15.6 years, 74% female, 59% black or African American, 11.8% diagnosed with PE), 14 (9.2%) met PERC, none of whom were diagnosed with PE. A low-risk Wells score (≤ 4) was assigned to 110 (72%) subjects, of whom only 38 (35%) underwent clinical D-dimer testing (elevated in 33/38). Of the 72 subjects with low-risk Wells scores who did not have D-dimers performed in the ED, archived research samples were negative in 16 (22%). All 21 subjects with low-risk Wells scores and negative D-dimers were PE-negative. CT-PA time (median = 160 minutes) accounted for more than half of total ED LOS (median = 295 minutes).

Conclusions

In total, 9.2 and 13.8% of CT-PA procedures could have been avoided by use of PERC and Wells/D-dimer, respectively.

### SCCT guidelines on radiation dose and dose-optimization strategies in cardiovascular CT [^2ea8637d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2011). Medium credibility.

Triple rule-out CT in acute chest pain — dose and heart-rate considerations: A single scan to exclude acute pulmonary embolism, acute aortic dissection, and coronary artery disease (triple rule-out) is feasible with injection protocol modification, but the longer scan length leads to an increase in radiation exposure compared with a coronary-specific scan, and surveys showing a very low yield of unexpected diagnoses argue against routine use. When both coronary CT angiography and another test are required, the triple rule-out protocol reduces both radiation exposure and contrast dose compared with two separate examinations. In practice, heart-rate control with β-blockade has been possible for triple rule-out as in dedicated coronary evaluations; if β-blockers are ruled out, the procedure should probably not be performed unless the patient's heart rate is especially low or a scanner with high temporal resolution is available.

### Use of spiral computed tomography contrast angiography and ultrasonography to exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^6b15f505]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Spiral computed tomography (CT) contrast angiography is a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism but the negative predictive value of this test remains controversial. We performed a multi-center prospective cohort study to determine the safety of relying on a negative spiral CT contrast angiography scan to exclude pulmonary embolism. Patients presenting to the Emergency Departments of three tertiary care institutions with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were potentially eligible for the study. Patients underwent a clinical evaluation to categorize pretest probability into low, moderate, and high categories, and had D-dimer testing performed. Patients at low pretest probability with normal D-dimer were considered to have pulmonary embolism excluded. The remaining patients underwent spiral CT contrast angiography scan of the pulmonary arterial circulation and bilateral venous ultrasound of the proximal leg veins. Patients who were confirmed to have pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis were treated with anticoagulant therapy. Patients in whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was excluded did not receive anticoagulant therapy and were followed for a 3-month period for the development of venous thromboembolic complications. Eight hundred fifty-eight (858) patients were enrolled in this study. Three-hundred sixty-nine (369) patients had low pretest probability and negative D-dimer results and no further diagnostic tests were performed. None of these patients subsequently developed venous thromboembolic complications (0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0% to 1.0%). The remaining 489 were referred for spiral CT contrast angiography scan and ultrasound. Sixty-seven patients were confirmed to have pulmonary embolism and an additional 15 patients with negative CT scans had proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound for a total prevalence of venous thromboembolism of 82/489 (16.8%). Two of 409 patients who had pulmonary embolism excluded in the initial evaluation phase developed proximal venous thromboembolism (0.5%; 95% CI 0% to 1.8%) in the 3-month follow-up period. These findings suggest that the combination of a negative spiral CT contrast angiography scan and normal venous ultrasound imaging safely excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the Emergency Department setting.

### SPECT / CT and pulmonary embolism [^692ef4cf]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, often undiagnosed and potentially fatal disease. Mortality is between 10% and 30% if untreated, but can be reduced to 2–8% with treatment. Various clinical symptoms and findings together with knowledge of predisposing factors may strengthen or weaken the clinical suspicion. PE can be ruled out if the clinical suspicion is low and the D-dimer test is negative. However, in those patients in whom the clinical suspicion is moderate or high and/or the D-dimer test is positive, a conclusive imaging test such as a ventilation/perfusion (V/P) study or pulmonary CT angiography (CTPA) is needed to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE. There is increasing evidence of the improved accuracy of single photon emission CT (SPECT) and SPECT combined with low-dose CT (SPECT/CT) compared to planar V/P scintigraphy, and likewise of multidetector CTPA compared to single-detector CTPA. There is, however, less evidence concerning comparisons between SPECT and SPECT/CT and CTPA.

In this article, the clinical value and protocols of lung V/P studies with SPECT, SPECT/CT and CTPA are discussed.

### Diagnostic yield of CT thorax angiography in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism: independent predictors and protocol adherence [^5411bb22]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, potentially life-threatening disease that requires timely and effective treatment. Its diagnosis can be difficult, since symptoms are non-specific. Current Dutch guidelines recommend a diagnostic work-up in three steps. Firstly, the clinical probability should be determined by calculating a Wells score. Wells' criteria are shown in Table 1. Secondly either the Wells-score is high (a score of more than four points) and a computed tomography scan of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA) should be made or, if the Wells score is low (four points or less), the D-dimer level should be assessed. Thirdly, a high D-dimer level (≥ 0.5 mg/ml) also dictates performing CTPA. CTPA is currently regarded as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Its sensitivity is estimated between 60% and 100% and its specificity between 81% and 98%. Studies show that the diagnostic yield of CTPA for pulmonary embolism varies between 6.7% and 31%. In our teaching hospital (Isala, Zwolle, The Netherlands) approximately 1000 CTPA's are made annually. Most of these CTPAs are requested by pulmonologists, internal medicine specialists or cardiologists. In this pilot study we tried to investigate the quality of the diagnostic work-up for pulmonary embolism in our hospital. We tried to determine whether there were differences in diagnostic yield between the requesting specialties, to find out the extent of protocol adherence (to perform the aforementioned diagnostic steps in the right order) and to assess independent predictors of diagnostic yield of CTPA. We expected a uniformly good standard of diagnostics, with a diagnostic yield conforming to figures from the recent literature, with room for improvement of protocol adherence.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^72739e9f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The utility of CTPA to provide an alternative diagnosis is often cited as justification for obtaining this test even when PE is not found. In prior studies, the most frequently cited alternative diagnosis on CTPA is an infiltrate or consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. However, it is not recorded whether a history and physical examination had already suggested pneumonia; neither was it noted whether a chest radiogram was performed prior to the CTPA. While it is difficult to compare studies as purpose, setting and design differ, one retrospective study reported a third of CTPAs revealed an alternative explanation of the patient's presenting symptoms but such findings were already known in over half of patients from the admission chest radiogram. In our center, 40% of the chest X-rays performed prior to the CTPA were interpreted as normal, while in 13% of patients a chest film was not obtained within 48 hours of ordering the CTPA. This indicates that in just fewer than half the patients (47%) a pathological diagnosis was present on the chest film. Clearly the presence of a radiological process on chest X-ray does not rule out the concomitant presence of PE, and we cannot determine what the ordering physician was considering. However the combination of diminishing yield of the CTPA from 2000 to 2010, the younger and healthier patients on whom CTPA is being performed, the underutilization of pre-tests probability and D-dimer, the presence of known lung pathology on a chest film, the drop in V/Q scans not matched by the increase in the number of CTPAs, all attest to the unjustified overuse of CTPA.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^c1db5e6f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Spiral computed tomography for acute pulmonary embolism [^d7e4d745]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

There is still considerable debate about the optimal diagnostic imaging modality for acute pulmonary embolism. If imaging is deemed necessary from an initial clinical evaluation such as d-dimer testing, options include nuclear medicine scanning, catheter pulmonary angiography, and spiral CT. In many institutions, spiral CT is becoming established as the first-line imaging test in daily clinical practice. With spiral CT, thrombus is directly visualized, and both mediastinal and parenchymal structures are evaluated, which may provide important alternative or additional diagnoses. However, limitations for the accurate diagnosis of small peripheral emboli, with a reported miss rate of up to 30% with single-slice spiral CT so far, have prevented the unanimous embrace of spiral CT as the new standard of reference for imaging pulmonary embolism. The clinical significance of the detection and treatment of isolated peripheral pulmonary emboli is uncertain. Evidence is accumulating that it is safe practice to withhold anticoagulation in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism on the basis of a negative spiral CT study. Remaining concerns about the accuracy of spiral CT for pulmonary embolism detection may be overcome by the introduction of multidetector-row spiral CT. This widely available technology has improved visualization of peripheral pulmonary arteries and detection of small emboli. The most recent generation of multidetector-row spiral CT scanners appears to outperform competing imaging modalities for the accurate detection of central and peripheral pulmonary embolism. In this review, we assess the current role and future potential of CT in the diagnostic algorithm of acute pulmonary embolism.

### Development and performance of the pulmonary embolism result forecast model (PERFORM) for computed tomography clinical decision support [^a8983b0e]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Figure 1 A illustrates the proposed workflow that transforms raw EMR data arranged as a timeline into feature vectors and uses a machine learning model to estimate the PE imaging outcomes to facilities' clinical decisions. To train the model, we followed the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guideline and used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) value to report the performance. Trained models are validated on Stanford University hospital and clinics (SHC) and Duke University Medical Center (Duke) holdout test sets as well as tested on separate SHC and Duke outpatient populations. We compared traditional machine learning models and a new deep learning model against 3 popular clinical scoring systems: Wells, Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC), and rGeneva. As a primary measure, the accuracy of the prediction was evaluated by the AUROC curve, which is a well-accepted single-performance measure to show the trade-off between true-positive and false-positive prediction rates. The Duke University Institutional Review Board and Stanford University Institutional Review Board approved the study with waiver of informed consent because of the use of deidentified data.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^8b238028]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^ad8057c2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

From the year 2000 to 2010, the total number of CTPA performed at our center increased exponentially although the percentage of scans positive for PE declined. This increase in CTPA was not accompanied (or justified) by finding an alternative diagnoses on CTPA that explains the patients' symptoms. Indeed, our data indicate that CTPA rarely reveals a previously unknown or new finding especially in those with low and intermediate risk for PE. CTPA provided an alternate diagnosis, defined as one that was not previously known or evident on chest radiograph in only 7.6% of all non-PE CTPA. Additionally, this number would drop to 3.2% had the published guidelines for investigation of suspected PE been followed, that is in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability and a negative D dimer. We also find that CTPAs were being performed in younger patients even in the absence of symptoms and identifiable PE risk factors further negating the argument of discovering an alternative pathological diagnosis. Finally, the increase in the number of CTPA corresponds neither to the decrease in the number of V/Q scans nor to the increase in the number of ED visits or hospital admissions.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^8cf593d2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Accepted recommendations for the diagnosis of PE continue to emphasize pre-test probability to guide the choice of testing, and the positive predictive value of CTPA remains dependent on the pre-test probability of PE. We used documentation of pre-test probability in patients' medical records as a surrogate for assignment of pre-test probability by any means, subjective or objective. It is possible that assessment of pre-test probability was performed by physicians prior to CTPA, but not specifically recorded. However, if this were the case, such assessment of pre-test probability occurred in a rather small minority of patients for the following two reasons. First, D-dimer was only measured in 20% of all patients with a low or intermediate pre-test probability of PE. Second, only 1 in 5 patients in the high pre-test probability category received anticoagulation while awaiting confirmation of PE with a CTPA. Our study was designed to investigate the rates and indications for the use of CTPA in clinical practice and therefore only includes patients undergoing CTPA. It is possible that patients presented with low risk for PE, were appropriately screened and did not undergo CTPA. We believe that such number is small as our data reveal that younger patients with fewer risk factors for PE were undergoing CTPA.

### Coronary computed tomographic imaging in women: an expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^371dc233]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2018). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) radiation risk and imaging selection are outlined as follows: The risk from radiation to the fetus is very small for CT imaging of the thorax, and fetal radiation doses from chest CT or pulmonary CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism are estimated to be approximately 0.02 mGy, whereas CT scans that directly image the fetus have higher doses such as CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at 13mGy. At radiation doses of < 50mGy, there is no potential non-stochastic effect independent of gestational age, and given CTA of the thorax is estimated at 0.02 mGy, there is negligible risk for non-stochastic fetal harm for CT that is confined to the thorax. For stochastic risk, models indicate the incremental risk of cancer from a fetal radiation dose of 10 mGy ranges from 1 in 4554 in the high-risk model to 1 in 1667 in the low risk model. The American College of Radiology (ACR) practice parameter recommends establishing multidisciplinary guidelines to reduce fetal exposure by limiting sequential imaging and utilizing alternative radiation-free tests when feasible and available; when visualization of coronary arteries is medically necessary and options are limited, while cardiac MR angiography is radiation-free it is not widely available and invasive cardiac catheterization may pose higher procedural risk, thus the widely available non-invasive CTA may be the most viable option, and care should be taken to ensure that the CT parameters be tailored to minimize radiation exposure to as low as reasonably achievable without rendering images non-diagnostic.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2022). High credibility.

Acute chest pain — patients with no known coronary artery disease (CAD): recommended pathways (Table 2a) outline scenario-specific roles for coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and alternatives. For ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with "ECG diagnostic for STEMI", the note emphasizes "Door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes". For a leading diagnosis of non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) characterized by "ST-changes suggestive of ischemia (no ST-elevation)" and "Elevated cTn or hs-cTn 99th percentile", the table notes "Invasive coronary angiography; Coronary CTA is rarely indicated to determine if invasive evaluation is appropriate". For high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with "Normal or nonischemic ECG, high pretest risk for ACS*, and: Normal or equivocal baseline cTn, or hs-cTn 99th percentile", "Coronary CTA is an alternative to functional testing or invasive angiography". For low-to-intermediate risk with "Normal or nonischemic ECG, low-to-intermediate risk for ACS*, and: Normal or equivocal baseline cTn, or hs-cTn 99th percentile" and "Inadequate or mildly abnormal functional testing during the index ED visit or within the previous 1 year", "Coronary CTA is most effective to rule-out ACS". For very low risk with "Normal or nonischemic ECG, very low risk for ACS, and: Normal hs-cTn, or Normal cTn, and leading diagnosis is non-cardiac chest pain", the note states "Very low risk patients may not benefit from additional testing; Coronary CTA may be appropriate in some patients to confidently exclude CAD and provide risk stratification". The table adds that "Triple rule-out CTA can substitute for coronary CTA if there is reasonable risk for both ACS and either PE or AAS (see Table 4). The CT scanner used must be cardiac-capable with a minimum of 64 multidetector units, and offer reasonable likelihood for diagnostic quality", and indicates use of a "Using a pre-test clinical decision assessment tool (Table 1)".

### Diagnostic yield of CT thorax angiography in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism: independent predictors and protocol adherence [^e19678ee]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The presence of an alternative diagnosis for the symptoms of the patients with cardiac history, COPD, atelectasis/consolidate on CT and/or interstitial abnormalities on CT could be the explanation for the lower yield of CTPA in these patients. The influence of age could be attributed to the fact that with increasing age the incidence of pulmonary embolism is also increased. The association with higher diagnostic yield in patients with chest pain and dyspnea is an indication that these findings correctly raise a suspicion of pulmonary embolism. Female sex seemed to protect against finding pulmonary embolism. To explain this, two possible reasons can be given. Firstly, in our study significantly lower D-dimer levels and almost significantly lower Wells scores were found in females. Secondly, in our study, more females than men were undergoing CTPA, while the literature showed that there are reasons to believe that the incidence of pulmonary embolism is equal among the sexes. It may be the case that doctors are sooner inclined to perform CTPA in (young) female patients because of risk-factors not being scored in the Wells table, e.g. contraceptives or pregnancy, even though this is speculative.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^676197fc]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) in children — PE is relatively rare with an annual incidence of 0.14 to 0.9 per 100 000 children and is often associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with one study reporting 72% of patients with a PE had a concurrent DVT and another finding 11% of patients with DVT also had a PE; mortality estimates range from 8.9% to 22%. For diagnostic testing, a 10-year retrospective pediatric study of D-dimer in 526 children found a lower limit of sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 54%, and current evidence does not support the routine use of D-dimer as a screening test to rule-out PE; because many pediatric PEs are associated with DVT, it may be reasonable to pursue lower extremity ultrasonography as part of the initial imaging process although this should not be relied on to exclude the diagnosis, with other options that can be considered including computed tomography venography (CTV) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) depending on clinical concern and availability. For imaging of suspected PE, CT pulmonary angiogram is generally considered the diagnostic test of choice when there is high clinical concern, with adult data demonstrating a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 95%, whereas ventilation or perfusion scans have lower sensitivity and are often non diagnostic with a risk of false-positivity in alternative diagnoses causing ventilation/perfusion mismatch.

### Performance of helical computed tomography in unselected outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^4be2d3e9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Helical computed tomography (CT) is commonly used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, although its operating characteristics have been insufficiently evaluated.

Objective

To assess the sensitivity and specificity of helical CT in suspected pulmonary embolism.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Emergency department of a teaching and community hospital.

Patients

299 patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism and a plasma D -dimer level greater than 500 microgram/L.

Intervention

Pulmonary embolism was established by using a validated algorithm that included clinical assessment, lower-limb compression ultrasonography, lung scanning, and pulmonary angiography.

Measurements

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of helical CT and interobserver agreement. Helical CT scans were withheld from clinicians and were read 3 months after acquisition by radiologists blinded to all clinical data.

Results

118 patients (39%) had pulmonary embolism. In 12 patients (4%), 2 of whom had pulmonary embolism, results of helical CT were inconclusive. For patients with conclusive results, sensitivity of helical CT was 70% (95% CI, 62% to 78%) and specificity was 91% (CI, 86% to 95%). Interobserver agreement was high (kappa = 0.823 to 0.902). The false-negative rate was lower for helical CT used after initial negative results on ultrasonography than for helical CT alone (21% vs. 30%). Use of helical CT after normal results on initial ultrasonography and nondiagnostic results on lung scanning had a false-negative rate of only 5% and a false-positive rate of only 7%.

Conclusion

Helical CT should not be used alone for suspected pulmonary embolism but could replace angiography in combined strategies that include ultrasonography and lung scanning.

### High-pitch CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with ultra-low contrast medium volume for the detection of pulmonary embolism: a comparison with standard CTPA [^15a76cc6]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our high-pitch CTPA protocol using ultra-low contrast volume (20 mL) in normal weight patients rendered diagnostic images for the detection of pulmonary arterial embolism at concomitantly reduced radiation exposure compared to a standard CTPA. While subjective image quality was comparable, objective image quality was worse in high-pitch CTPA but likely still within accepted ranges for diagnosis. Therefore, careful patient preparation, precise contrast timing, and perhaps prior screening of the heart function may be advisable.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ca34534]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates CTPA's crucial significance in identifying PE in trauma patients, highlighting its high sensitivity and specificity. Despite its effectiveness, the diversity in PE frequency among trauma patients, as well as the accompanying death rates, highlight the challenges of identifying and treating PE in this group. The limits of D-dimer testing and clinical prediction guidelines in the trauma population, together with the confounding effects of trauma, demand a careful approach to diagnosing PE. This study emphasizes the importance of CTPA in traumatic situations to diagnose, improving treatment, weighing the advantages of early and accurate PE diagnosis against the hazards and costs of CTPA. According to our findings, lower threshold for CTPA is recommended in patients with lower extremity or spine fractures. Future research should aim to precisely demonstrate the differences between trauma and other medial nature of PE development and subsequently modify the guidelines specified for trauma patients refine diagnostic strategies.

CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) — diagnostic performance and protocol in CTEPH notes that computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is commonly used in CTEPH evaluation because of its ability to visualize chronic thromboembolic disease, and in a meta-analysis pooled high-quality studies demonstrated a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 97% for the identification of chronic PE. Recognition of CTEPH signs requires a high quality diagnostic CTPA, and we recommend reviewing multiplanar images in mediastinal windows using a slice thickness of ≤ 1 mm because webs and wall thickening can measure < 1 mm in thickness and may not be visible using thick slice reconstructions. All studies required optimal imaging quality and expert radiology readers, and direct signs of chronic PE include slits/webs, eccentric thrombus, and occlusions/pouch defects.

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (adult), low pretest probability — For low PTP/prevalence (≤ 5%), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel recommends using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 5%), followed by ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for patients requiring additional testing. If D-dimer is not readily available, alternate acceptable strategies include performing VQ scan or CTPA alone. The document specifies a strong recommendation for D-dimer and a conditional recommendation for VQ scan or CTPA alone. Remarks state that for patients presenting to an emergency department with a low probability of PE, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is warranted, that validated clinical decision rules were used and the Geneva score has been validated on an outpatient population, that if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used this corresponds to the "unlikely PE" category, that a decision to start with D-dimer assumes timely results and cost offset by avoiding unnecessary VQ or CTPA, and that if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required.

### Computed tomography for suspected pulmonary embolism results in a large number of non-significant incidental findings and follow-up investigations [^8c1ee5c5]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) are often ordered to evaluate pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED). The increase use of CTPA has led to an increase in incidental findings, often of low clinical significance. Our objectives were to (1) assess the prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings identified in patients evaluated with CTPAs for PE in the ED, (2) evaluate follow-up investigations for these incidental findings, and (3) assess the utility of routine chest X-rays done prior to CTPA.

Methods

This is a historical cohort study of adult patients, presenting to two tertiary care EDs from January-December 2015, evaluated with CTPA for possible PE. Two reviewers' extracted data from electronic CT records in a standardized fashion with inter-rater reliability reported using the kappa statistic. We measured the prevalence of PE and stratified non-PE findings according to alternative diagnoses and incidental findings. Data were reported as mean and standard deviation (SD). Univariate analyses were performed with t test for continuous variables.

Results

A total of 1708 studies were included (mean 62 years (SD 16.7), 56.9% female). PE was found in 233 (13.6%) patients. A total of 223 (13.1%) patients had an incidental finding, the majority of which included pulmonary nodules (n = 83, 37.2%) and adenopathy (n = 26, 11.6%). Of the incidental findings, 197 (88.3%) were non-significant and led to no definitive diagnosis of cancer. In patients who underwent both CTPA and chest X-ray, X-ray reports revealed the same diagnosis in 77% of PE-negative patients without missing a clinically significant incidental finding.

Conclusions

Incidental findings are as common as a diagnosis of PE in patients undergoing CTPA. They are rarely clinically significant. Chest radiograph remains a reasonable initial investigation as it can aid in identifying alternative diagnoses especially in the setting of a low pre-test probability for PE.

### Incidence and predictors of repeated computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in emergency department patients [^1422c714]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the pulmonary arteries to evaluate for pulmonary embolism has increased, raising concern about radiation and contrast toxicity. We sought to measure the frequency of repeat CT pulmonary angiography in emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

This was a prospective, longitudinal follow-up of ED patients who underwent first-time CT pulmonary angiography as part of a research protocol for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in 2001 to 2002. Two authors (DMB and MCK) searched electronic medical record databases to measure the frequency of repeated CT scans performed within 5 years. Primary outcome was greater than or equal to 1 repeated CT pulmonary angiography examination. Radiologist-written interpretations of CT pulmonary angiography were categorized by 2 observers (DMB and JAK). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for 24 clinical variables.

Results

A cohort of 675 ED patients was observed for a median of 1,989 days: 226 of 675 (33%) had at least 1 additional CT pulmonary angiography scan, and 60 died with no repeated CT pulmonary angiography, leading to a mortality-adjusted frequency of repeated CT pulmonary angiography scanning of 226 of 615, or 37%. Seventy-three percent of the cohort had 1 or more subsequent CT scans of any body part, and 31 patients (5%) had 5 or more repeated CT pulmonary angiography scans. The pulmonary embolism (positive) prevalence was 57 of 675 (8.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5% to 10.8%) on the first CT pulmonary angiography versus 8 of 226 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.5% to 6.9%) on the second CT pulmonary angiography scan. Hazard ratios indicated that respiratory rate, active malignancy, previous coronary artery disease, and previous or new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism were positively associated with repeated CT pulmonary angiography scanning.

Conclusion

At least one third of ED patients who undergo CT pulmonary angiography scanning will have a second CT pulmonary angiography result that will be negative for pulmonary embolism. New methods are needed to exclude pulmonary embolism recurrence without use of ionizing radiation.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy [^7ce7fec1]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

ASH guideline — pregnancy with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE): In pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism, the ASH guideline panel suggests V/Q lung scanning over CT pulmonary angiography (conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). In follow-up studies in which anticoagulants were withheld after negative imaging, V/Q scanning and CT pulmonary angiography had a low and similar frequency of false-negative results (0.50% [95% CI, 0.02%-1.3%] and 0.4% [95% CI, 0.2%-1.3%], respectively), corresponding to, for every 1000 women screened, 5 (95% CI, 2–13) pulmonary emboli incorrectly ruled out with V/Q scanning and 4 (95% CI, 2–13) with CT pulmonary angiography. Based on modeling data, V/Q scanning seems safer for the mother than CT pulmonary angiography with respect to breast-absorbed radiation dose and potential risk of future breast cancer, while maternal risks from contrast exposure with CT pulmonary angiography and radiopharmaceutical exposure with V/Q scanning are similar. Typical fetal radiation doses from both modalities are far below the suggested accepted maximal cumulative threshold for fetal radiation exposure, and any potential absolute increase in the risk of childhood cancer is likely to be very small, as is the risk for fetal hypothyroidism secondary to contrast-associated iodine exposure with CT pulmonary angiography. Access and practical considerations are noted: V/Q lung scanning is likely not as readily available as CT pulmonary angiography at all centers, and in instances where it is not available, CT pulmonary angiography would be acceptable; in addition, CT pulmonary angiography might be preferred in patients with abnormal chest radiographs.

### Trends in imaging for suspected pulmonary embolism across US health care systems, 2004 to 2016 [^3f63647c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism is a common and potentially fatal disease, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of up to 5%. Approximately 20% of individuals with pulmonary embolism (PE) die before diagnosis or on the first day after their diagnosis. Because the signs and symptoms of PE are often nonspecific, advanced imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis. Ventilation-perfusion lung studies (V/Q scans, a nuclear medicine examination) were traditionally the noninvasive imaging test of choice, but in the early 2000s this imaging modality was supplanted by chest computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Chest CTPA is faster and more sensitive than V/Q scan; however, the improved sensitivity is at least in part believed to be owing to the detection of inconsequential, subsegmental PE.

Since its introduction, CTPA has been embraced by emergency department (ED) and hospital physicians, and rates of use have increased dramatically, resulting in concerns of overuse. Previous studies examining trends in the use of computed tomography (CT) (based on survey or claims data) have not distinguished chest CT (ie, all chest CT except for CTPA) from CTPA. In 2001, CT (including CTPA) was used in 2.6% of ED visits for chest pain or shortness of breath, which increased to 12.5% in 2009, with an average growth of 28.1% per year. In an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with suspected PEfrom 2002 to 2009, chest CT use increased 5-fold, but positivity rates (yield) decreased from 7.3% in 2002 to 5.9% in 2009. This finding suggests that a smaller percentage of patients have received the potential benefit of CTPA with respect to improved detection, and more patients have experienced potential harms, including exposure to ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast, and overdiagnosis. This observation is further supported by an increasing incidence of PE, with a lower case mortality rate but no change in overall PE mortality.

### Combined helical computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and lung perfusion scintigraphy for investigating acute pulmonary embolism [^cac3fb49]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate a diagnostic protocol incorporating helical computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and lung perfusion scintigraphy in the detection or exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in routine clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

A prospective observational study of 808 consecutive patients with suspected acute PE was undertaken over a 23-month period. Twenty-nine cases who failed to follow the protocol were excluded, leaving 779 cases to be reviewed. The three main outcome measures were negative perfusion scintigraphy, positive CTPA and other significant abnormalities demonstrated on CT.

Results

Two hundred and thirty-one (30%) had negative perfusion scintigraphy and no further investigation. CTPA was performed in 548 (70%) and PE confirmed in 193 (25% of all patients). Other significant abnormalities were demonstrated in 25 (3%). CTPA was technically inadequate in 15 (2%).

Conclusions

A confident conclusion was achieved in 449 cases (58%), with PE excluded in 231 (30%), proved in 193 (25%), and relevant alternative abnormalities found in 25 (3%). This protocol using both perfusion scintigraphy and CTPA is practical and more effective than either investigation alone.

### Computer-assisted detection of pulmonary embolism: evaluation of pulmonary CT angiograms performed in an on-call setting [^7615946c]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Distribution of emboli and sensitivity per embolus

Our reference standard determined that 68 out of 278 patients were positive for PE. A total of 377 emboli were detected in the 68 patients. Twenty-three emboli were localised in the main pulmonary arteries, 41 in lobar, 80 in segmental and 233 in the subsegmental arteries. In 37 patients, there were emboli extending into the main and/or lobar arteries. Thirty-one patients had only segmental and/or subsegmental emboli. Fourteen patients had isolated subsegmental emboli. The per-embolus sensitivity of the CAD as a stand-alone system was 87, 78, 79 and 61% respectively for emboli in the main, lobar, segmental and subsegmental arteries.

Patient-based evaluation

CAD correctly identified PE in seven patients originally reported as negative. In five patients, CAD found a solitary embolus in a segmental (n = 2) or subsegmental (n = 3) artery. In two patients, CAD found two subsegmental emboli.

On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity of the CAD system was 94% (64/68) and the specificity 21% (44/210). CAD correctly identified 93% (13/14) of the patients with isolated subsegmental emboli.

In four patients, we found no embolism although the original reports had been positive. In 21% of the negative cases, there were no FP findings by CAD. The negative predictive value (NPV) of an examination without any candidate lesion found by the CAD algorithm was 92% (Tables 1 and 2).

Analysis of false positives

For the remaining 278 examinations, the CAD algorithm showed on average 4.7 FP lesions per examination (median 2, range 0–42) with most lesions located in non-arterial structures such as veins (30%) or intrapulmonary opacifications (22%). There were on average 3.5 FP lesions (median 2.5, range 0–15) in the group of patients with PE and 5.0 (median 2, range 0–42) in the group without PE. In 72% of the examinations CAD indicated ≤ 5 FP, in 13% of the examinations CAD indicated ≥ 10 FP. Nine examinations had more than 20 FP lesions, and all of them were negative for the presence of PE according to the standard.

### Computer-assisted detection of pulmonary embolism: evaluation of pulmonary CT angiograms performed in an on-call setting [^53279f64]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Our results are comparable to those of the study by Walsham et al. They found an NPV of 84% and a specificity of 20% in a smaller (n = 100), but also non-selected patient group. While Zhou et al. showed an average of 14.4 false positives per study, our system produced 4.7 false positives per study. Under the assumption that a maximum of 5 false positive lesions per examination marked by CAD represents an acceptable level in clinical routine, this criterion was met in 72% of our patients. Thus most examinations produce a relatively low number of false-positive lesions. The median number of false-positive lesions was 2 with most located in non-arterial structures such as veins (30%) or intrapulmonary opacifications (22%). Thus it is likely that in most scans the false-positive lesions can easily be sorted out. The exact impact of the false-positive lesions on diagnostic accuracy and reading time, however, remains to be determined in a reader study. More than 10 false-positive lesions were seen in 13% of the CTPA examinations; not surprisingly, higher numbers of false-positive lesions correlated with lower image quality. Further reduction of false-positive lesions per image is needed as too many may have a negative influence on diagnostic performance, lead to an unnecessarily prolonged reading time and might even cause unnecessary treatment.

Our study suffers from some limitations. There is no absolute reference standard for CTPA studies. Diagnostic pulmonary catheter angiography has been completely substituted by multidetector CTPA and had additionally been questioned as reference standard anyway. We therefore established a reference standard by independent evaluation of two readers with a third reader in case of discordant findings.

We evaluated the stand-alone performance of the CAD software to provide an estimate of the performance of the algorithm. In our study group, 10% of PE patients were originally missed by the on-call radiologist, all of whom had PE identified by CAD. However, comparison between the performance of CAD as a stand-alone system and that of the original reports is not sufficient to define the role of CAD in a clinical setting. The potential benefit of a CAD system strongly depends on the interaction with the reader, his or her experience and ability to discriminate between true- and false-positive candidate lesions. More studies are necessary to evaluate the use of CAD as a second reading and to assess its impact on the reader's capability not only to detect emboli but also to exclude pulmonary embolism.

### Pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm for diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism [^bb0950d3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of maternal death in the Western world. Because of the low specificity and sensitivity of the d-dimer test, all pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism undergo computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning, both of which involve radiation exposure to the mother and fetus. Whether a pregnancy-adapted algorithm could be used to safely avoid diagnostic imaging in pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism is unknown.

Methods

In a prospective study involving pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism, we assessed three criteria from the YEARS algorithm (clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis, hemoptysis, and pulmonary embolism as the most likely diagnosis) and measured the d-dimer level. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out if none of the three criteria were met and the d-dimer level was less than 1000 ng per milliliter or if one or more of the three criteria were met and the d-dimer level was less than 500 ng per milliliter. Adaptation of the YEARS algorithm for pregnant women involved compression ultrasonography for women with symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis; if the results were positive (i.e., a clot was present), CT pulmonary angiography was not performed. All patients in whom pulmonary embolism had not been ruled out underwent CT pulmonary angiography. The primary outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism at 3 months. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients in whom CT pulmonary angiography was not indicated to safely rule out pulmonary embolism.

Results

A total of 510 women were screened, of whom 12 (2.4%) were excluded. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 20 patients (4.0%) at baseline. During follow-up, popliteal deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 1 patient (0.21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 1.2); no patient had pulmonary embolism. CT pulmonary angiography was not indicated, and thus was avoided, in 195 patients (39%; 95% CI, 35 to 44). The efficiency of the algorithm was highest during the first trimester of pregnancy and lowest during the third trimester; CT pulmonary angiography was avoided in 65% of patients who began the study in the first trimester and in 32% who began the study in the third trimester.

Conclusions

Pulmonary embolism was safely ruled out by the pregnancy-adapted YEARS diagnostic algorithm across all trimesters of pregnancy. CT pulmonary angiography was avoided in 32 to 65% of patients.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^829b3716]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis — high pretest probability (PTP) pathway: For hemodynamically stable, nonpregnant patients with high PTP/prevalence [≥ 50%], the figure outlines imaging-based strategies that include computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and VQ scan; in selected situations, a negative CTPA may be sufficient to rule out PE. When VQ scan pathways are nondiagnostic, proximal ultrasound is used, with serial proximal US if clinical PTP > 50%. The panel felt that the rate of FN scans for clinically significant PE was low and that additional testing was unlikely to be of value, although additional testing following a negative CTPA may be considered based on clinical judgment. Non-high clinical PTP is referred to other algorithms.

### Accuracy of X-ray with perfusion scan in young patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^ef910add]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) has become the standard test in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, young patients may have an increased risk of cancer with CTPA. Perfusion scanning combined with chest X-ray (X/Q) may offer an adequate alternative, but has never been prospectively validated. We directly compared this strategy with CTPA in patients aged ≤ 50years with suspected PE.

Methods

Consecutive patients with a likely clinical probability or an abnormal D-dimer level underwent both CTPA and X/Q. Two trained and experienced nuclear physicians independently analyzed the X/Q-scans. The accuracy of X/Q according to the PISAPED criteria was calculated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

Results

Seventy-six patients were included, with a PE rate of 33%. The inter-observer agreement for X/Q-scan reading was high (κ = 0.89). After consensus reading, 21 patients (28%) were categorized as 'PE present', 53 (70%) as 'PE absent', and two (2.6%) as 'non-diagnostic'. In 22%, there was a discrepancy between the X/Q-scan and CPTA for the diagnosis or exclusion of PE. The PPV and NPV were 71% and 83%, respectively.

Conclusion

In patients with a high risk of PE, a diagnostic strategy of chest X-ray and perfusion scanning using the PISAPED criteria seems less safe than CTPA. Additional studies should further investigate this diagnostic algorithm.

### Efficacy of an automated pulmonary embolism (PE) detection algorithm on routine contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging for non-PE studies [^775aaa52]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The urgency to accelerate PE management and minimize patient risk has driven the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms designed to provide a swift and accurate diagnosis in dedicated chest imaging (computed tomography pulmonary angiogram; CTPA) for suspected PE; however, the accuracy of AI algorithms in the detection of incidental PE in non-dedicated CT imaging studies remains unclear and untested. This study explores the potential for a commercial AI algorithm to identify incidental PE in non-dedicated contrast-enhanced CT chest imaging studies. The Viz PE algorithm was deployed to identify the presence of PE on 130 dedicated and 63 non-dedicated contrast-enhanced CT chest exams. The predictions for non-dedicated contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging studies were 90.48% accurate, with a sensitivity of 0.14 and specificity of 1.00. Our findings reflect that the Viz PE algorithm demonstrated an overall accuracy of 90.16%, with a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 41%. Although the high specificity is promising for ruling in PE, the low sensitivity highlights a limitation, as it indicates the algorithm may miss a substantial number of true-positive incidental PEs. This study demonstrates that commercial AI detection tools hold promise as integral support for detecting PE, particularly when there is a strong clinical indication for their use; however, current limitations in sensitivity, especially for incidental cases, underscore the need for ongoing radiologist oversight.

### Clinical criteria to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^69e2d88c]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC)" for pulmonary embolism.

The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) is a clinical prediction rule used to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) as a diagnosis in patients with low pretest probability. It is specifically designed for use in adult patients who are suspected of having a PE but are deemed to be at low risk based on clinical judgment.

The PERC rule is a useful tool in the emergency department setting, as it helps to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing, such as D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), in patients who are unlikely to have a PE.

The PERC rule should not be used in patients with a high pretest probability of PE, or in patients with signs of right ventricular strain or hypoxia. It is also not applicable to pregnant women or patients under the age of 18.

The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) calculator is designed to determine the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism (PE) based on specific clinical criteria. The calculator evaluates eight inputs, each representing a condition or risk factor associated with PE, assigning a score to responses and consequently interpreting the results to assess the likelihood of PE.

The inputs and their associated criteria are as follows:

- Age ≥ 50
- Heart rate ≥ 100
- SpO2 < 94%
- Unilateral leg swelling
- Hemoptysis
- Recent surgery within 4 weeks
- Prior pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis
- Oral hormone use

Each criterion corresponds to a boolean input and contributes a score of 1 if true (indicating the presence of the condition or risk factor). The total possible score ranges from 0 to 8.

The computation process involves checking each criterion and adding a score of 1 for each true response. The final score is the sum of these contributions.

Interpretation of results is straightforward:

- If the total score is 0, it indicates that pulmonary embolism is unlikely.
- If the total score is 1 or higher, there is a likelihood of pulmonary embolism.

### Cardiothoracic CT: one-stop-shop procedure? Impact on the management of acute pulmonary embolism [^65101874]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Computed tomography

While pulmonary angiography has long been considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of PE, nowadays computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first imaging method of choice in the workup of patients with suspected PE. Besides diagnosing PE by direct visualization of the thrombus, CTA can also be helpful in the risk stratification of patients with PE. As with echocardiography the RV/LV diameter ratio as a parameter of RVD can easily be assessed on CT. On axial views a RV/LV ratio ≥ 0.9–1.5 has been shown to be directly correlated with RVD and adverse outcome. The PPV is low (10%), but a RV/LV ratio < 1 has a high NPV (100%). Two examples of patients with extensive PE and RVD are given in Figs. 2 and 3. One patient suffered cardiac arrest and died shortly after; the other patient was hemodynamically stable at presentation.

Fig. 2
CTPA of a 31-year-old female patient who was reanimated. The 1-mm axial reconstructions demonstrate bilateral central pulmonary emboli with dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (a) and massive right-sided cardiac dilatation with compression of the left ventricle (b). The patient died shortly after as a result of massive cerebral ischemia

Fig. 3
CTPA performed in a 22-year-old male patient complaining of progressive dyspnea and chest pain, revealing extensive pulmonary emboli including the main pulmonary artery with dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (a, diameter 33 mm) and the right side of the heart (b). The wedge-shaped subpleural consolidation (c) is caused by pulmonary infarction (d, pulmonary window setting). Because of the extensive load and the right ventricular dysfunction at CT, the patient was admitted to the ICU for thrombolytic treatment. The patient became hypotensive shortly after arrival but recovered quickly after treatment. The follow-up CTPA after 1 week shows clearance of thrombus from the main pulmonary artery with normalization of its diameter (e, diameter 25 mm) and normalization of the right ventricle. There is still extensive thrombus present on both sides

### Pulmonary embolism [^8a2185e5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.
