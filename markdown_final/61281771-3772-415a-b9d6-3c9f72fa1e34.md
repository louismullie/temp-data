## Question

ALT 46

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an ALT of 46 U/L and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's sex and how that affects the upper limit of normal for ALT. Then, I should verify the laboratory's reported reference range and whether it reflects a healthy population. Next, I will compare 46 U/L to evidence-based "true normal" thresholds and assess clinical significance. After that, I need to consider common etiologies, especially NAFLD and alcohol, and less common but important causes. Finally, I should outline a practical, risk-stratified evaluation plan, including when to image, when to use noninvasive fibrosis scoring, and when to refer or biopsy, while remembering that normal ALT does not exclude significant liver disease [^116GN7V6] [^116bPbMD].

> Let me first confirm the sex-specific interpretation, because the "normal" ALT threshold differs by gender. For adult men, several high-quality sources converge on a true healthy ALT upper limit around 29–33 U/L, whereas for adult women it is about 19–25 U/L, so an ALT of 46 U/L is clearly above normal for women and borderline-to-mildly elevated for men depending on the exact cut point used [^112TeHbB] [^116sVVD1] [^1139kBWp].

> Wait, let me verify the lab's reference range before I jump to conclusions. Many laboratories still report a ULN of 40–60 U/L, but these ranges are often derived from mixed populations that include individuals with subclinical liver disease, which inflates the ULN; indeed, inter-laboratory ULNs vary widely, and some labs use manufacturer cutoffs or local controls rather than rigorously screened healthy cohorts, so I should not rely on a lab ULN alone to judge "normal" [^112nyEMD] [^115anVLY].

> I will now examine how 46 U/L maps to evidence-based thresholds. For a woman, 46 U/L is roughly 2.3–2.4 times the true normal ULN, which is a mild elevation; for a man, 46 U/L is about 1.4–1.6 times the true normal ULN, which is a borderline or mild elevation depending on the exact cut point, and in either case it warrants evaluation rather than reassurance [^112TeHbB] [^116sVVD1] [^113csajo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity or etiology from a single number. ALT is a marker of hepatocellular injury, not liver function, and its magnitude correlates poorly with histologic severity; importantly, normal ALT does not exclude NASH or advanced fibrosis, so even a "mild" elevation like 46 U/L deserves a structured workup rather than dismissal [^111Zqb9T] [^113nLMvo] [^116bPbMD].

> Next, I should review the most likely causes in primary care. Let me consider NAFLD first, given its prevalence and association with metabolic syndrome; even modest ALT elevations can track with insulin resistance and steatohepatitis, and guidelines advise screening for metabolic comorbidities whenever ALT exceeds about 30 U/L in adults, especially if persistent over 6–12 months [^113nLMvo] [^112TeHbB] [^116sVVD1].

> I need to check for alcohol use carefully, because even modest intake can raise ALT and confound interpretation; I should quantify intake, screen for risky drinking, and counsel reduction or abstinence pending evaluation, since alcohol-related liver disease often shows AST predominance with an AST:ALT ratio > 2 when advanced, though early disease may be subtle [^117CYLXn] [^117RYf6K].

> But wait, what if the elevation is transient or medication-related? I should confirm all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents, including acetaminophen at therapeutic doses, statins, and supplements, and consider drug-induced liver injury patterns; if suspected, I should stop the offending agent when feasible and recheck enzymes, recognizing that mild, transient ALT rises can occur with several drugs and may not mandate cessation without corroborating evidence of injury [^117LLTfB] [^114kp2NL] [^116PpXhr].

> I will now examine less common but important etiologies that I should not miss. Viral hepatitis B and C remain relevant, so I should obtain HBsAg and anti-HCV with reflex RNA if positive; autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should be considered based on risk and pattern, and I should remember that chronic HBV may have normal ALT yet harbor significant fibrosis, so I must integrate HBV DNA and clinical context rather than ALT alone [^1155asMt] [^112e4GN6] [^1139d42c].

> Let me think about extrahepatic sources, because I should confirm that ALT is truly hepatic. If AST is disproportionately elevated or if there are myopathic symptoms, I should check CK and consider muscle disease; conversely, if cholestasis is suspected, I should confirm hepatic alkaline phosphatase with GGT and pursue biliary evaluation as indicated [^112eRcGS] [^1155asMt].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic first-line evaluation. I need a focused history and exam for metabolic risk, alcohol, medications, and symptoms; obtain AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, INR, platelets, fasting glucose or A1c, and a lipid profile; and screen for hepatitis B and C; if NAFLD is suspected, I should also assess iron studies and, when appropriate, autoimmune serologies and Wilson or alpha-1 testing based on age and risk [^117CYLXn] [^1155asMt] [^113z2Ems].

> Hold on, I should verify persistence before escalating. If this ALT of 46 U/L is new, repeating liver chemistries in about 3–6 months after addressing modifiable risks is reasonable; however, if it is already persistent or accompanied by metabolic syndrome, I should proceed with imaging and fibrosis risk stratification rather than waiting, because delays can miss progressive disease [^117CYLXn] [^113nLMvo].

> I will now examine imaging and fibrosis assessment. Abdominal ultrasound can identify steatosis and alternative pathology, but I should not rely on ultrasound to exclude steatosis; noninvasive fibrosis scores such as FIB-4 or NFS help risk-stratify, and in patients with indeterminate or high risk, transient elastography or ELF can refine staging and guide referral decisions [^116GN7V6] [^113z2Ems].

> Let me reconsider the AST:ALT ratio, because it can provide a clue. In NAFLD, ALT typically exceeds AST, whereas an AST:ALT ratio ≥ 2 suggests alcoholic liver disease; however, I should double-check that I am not overinterpreting a single ratio without context, as advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis can also shift the ratio, and the ratio alone is not diagnostic [^117RYf6K].

> I should confirm referral triggers. Persistent ALT elevation beyond 6 months, indeterminate or high FIB-4, imaging evidence of advanced disease, or suspicion of autoimmune, genetic, or cholestatic disease should prompt hepatology referral; liver biopsy is generally reserved for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty or when staging will change management, not for a mild, unexplained ALT of 46 U/L alone [^113nLMvo] [^117CYLXn] [^113z2Ems].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal context is captured. I should review prior labs, because a new elevation has different implications than a chronic, stable pattern; I should also counsel on weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation, and metabolic control, and plan reassessment at 3–6 month intervals until the trajectory and etiology are clear, adjusting the workup based on new data and response to interventions [^115LahNR] [^113nLMvo] [^117CYLXn].

> In summary, an ALT of 46 U/L is a mild elevation that warrants evaluation rather than reassurance; for a woman it is unequivocally abnormal, and for a man it is borderline-to-mildly elevated against evidence-based "true normal" thresholds, so I should confirm persistence, assess metabolic and alcohol risks, obtain appropriate serologies, consider imaging and noninvasive fibrosis scoring, and refer if abnormalities persist or risk is high, remembering that normal ALT does not exclude significant liver disease [^116sVVD1] [^116bPbMD].

---

An ALT of 46 U/L is a **mild elevation** above the typical adult reference range (male ULN ~30–40 U/L; female ULN ~19–30 U/L) [^113csajo] and warrants a **focused evaluation** for common causes such as NAFLD, alcohol, medications, and viral hepatitis [^11799txx]. Confirm persistence with a repeat ALT in 3–6 months [^117CYLXn], assess metabolic risk (BMI, lipids, glucose) [^112TeHbB], review alcohol and medications, and order hepatitis B/C serologies [^1155asMt]. If ALT remains elevated or risk factors are present, obtain an abdominal ultrasound [^113z2Ems] and consider noninvasive fibrosis testing (FIB-4, transient elastography) [^113z2Ems]. Most mild ALT elevations are benign, but persistent or rising values require further workup to exclude liver disease [^112yo3Df].

---

## Normal reference ranges for ALT

ALT reference ranges vary by laboratory and population, but **commonly accepted upper limits of normal (ULN)** are:

| **Population** | **ULN (ALT)** |
|-|-|
| Adult males | 30–40 U/L |
| Adult females | 19–30 U/L |

---

An ALT of 46 U/L is a **mild elevation** above these ULNs, particularly in females [^112TeHbB].

---

## Clinical significance of mildly elevated ALT

Mild ALT elevations are common and often benign, but they can signal **early liver injury** or disease [^11799txx]. The clinical significance depends on persistence, associated risk factors, and the underlying cause [^117CYLXn].

---

## Common causes of mildly elevated ALT

Several conditions can cause **mild ALT elevations**, including:

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: Most common cause of mild ALT elevation, associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [^113Yditq].
- **Alcohol consumption**: Even moderate alcohol intake can elevate ALT [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Over-the-counter and prescription drugs (e.g. acetaminophen, statins, antibiotics) can cause mild ALT elevations [^114kp2NL].
- **Viral hepatitis**: Chronic hepatitis B or C can present with mild ALT elevations [^116duopG].
- **Other causes**: Autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and muscle injury [^1155asMt].

---

## Recommended evaluation and management

When evaluating a patient with an ALT of 46 U/L, the following **stepwise approach** is recommended:

---

### Initial evaluation

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat ALT measurement in 3–6 months to confirm chronic elevation [^117CYLXn].
- **History and physical examination**: Assess alcohol intake, medication use, metabolic risk factors, and symptoms of liver disease [^112TeHbB].
- **Laboratory tests**: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), fasting glucose, lipid profile, iron studies, and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA) if indicated [^112yo3Df].

---

### Further evaluation if ALT remains elevated

If ALT remains elevated after the initial evaluation, **additional testing** may include:

- **Abdominal ultrasound**: To assess for fatty liver, cirrhosis, or other structural liver diseases [^113z2Ems].
- **Non-invasive fibrosis assessment**: FIB-4 index, transient elastography (FibroScan) to evaluate liver fibrosis risk [^113z2Ems].
- **Liver biopsy**: Consider if non-invasive tests suggest advanced fibrosis or if the diagnosis remains unclear [^112o4UP2].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Mild ALT elevations are generally benign but may indicate early liver injury. Persistent elevations (> 6 months) warrant further evaluation to exclude chronic liver disease. Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, with NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease being the most common and potentially progressive if untreated [^112yo3Df].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and interventions

Lifestyle modifications are essential in managing mild ALT elevations, particularly in NAFLD:

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction [^notfound].
- **Dietary changes**: Mediterranean diet, reduced saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates [^notfound].
- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit or abstain from alcohol [^112o4UP2].
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week) [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Discontinue or replace hepatotoxic drugs if possible [^117CYLXn].

---

## When to refer to a specialist

Referral to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist is indicated if:

- **Persistent elevation**: ALT remains elevated beyond 6 months despite initial management [^113Yditq].
- **Advanced fibrosis**: Non-invasive tests suggest advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^113z2Ems].
- **Unclear diagnosis**: Despite initial evaluation, the cause remains unknown [^113z2Ems].
- **Complex cases**: Suspected autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^notfound].

---

An ALT of 46 U/L is a **mild elevation** above the normal range and warrants a **focused evaluation** to identify and address underlying causes. Most cases are benign, but persistent elevations require further workup to exclude chronic liver disease.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Updated definitions of healthy ranges for serum alanine aminotransferase levels [^113csajo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, the variable most commonly measured to assess hepatic disease, fails to identify many patients with hepatic injury. Current standards for "normal" ALT level were defined by using populations that included persons with subclinical liver disease.

Objective

To update definitions of healthy ranges for serum ALT level.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A university hospital in Milan, Italy.

Participants

6835 persons who were first-time blood donors from 1995 through 1999, were negative for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), and had no contraindications to donation and 209 persons who attempted to donate blood from 1990 through 1999 but were found to have anti-HCV antibodies. Of the latter group, 131 had HCV viremia.

Measurements

Univariate and multivariate analyses examined associations between clinical and laboratory factors and ALT levels. Healthy ranges for ALT were computed from the population at lowest risk for liver disease. Sensitivity and specificity of healthy ALT ranges were evaluated in the donors with HCV antibodies, of whom 133 had liver biopsy.

Results

Serum ALT activity was independently related to body mass index and to laboratory indicators of abnormal lipid or carbohydrate metabolism. Updated upper limits (for men, 500 nkat/L [30 U/L]; for women, 317 nkat/L [19 U/L]) were lower than current limits (for men, 667 nkat/L [40 U/L]; for women, 500 nkat/L [30 U/L]) and, during 6-month follow-up, showed superior sensitivity in identifying participants with HCV viremia (sensitivity, 76.3% [95% CI, 69.1% to 83.6%] vs. 55% [CI, 46.4% to 63.5%]). The related tradeoff in specificity was acceptable (88.5% [CI, 79.2% to 94.6%] vs. 97.4% [91% to 99.7%]). The increased sensitivity targeted patients with minimal to mild histologic lesions.

Conclusion

In patients with chronic HCV infection or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, revision of normal limits for ALT level is advisable.

Transaminase interpretation — limitations and thresholds are noted: Serum AST levels are often used clinically but can be normal in patients with diabetes, NASH, and advanced hepatic fibrosis; although AST levels are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying NAFLD/NASH with advanced fibrosis, intermittently or chronically (≥ 6–12 mo) elevated ALT or AST above a threshold of 30 U/L may suggest the presence of chronic liver injury, with these thresholds exceeding many laboratory upper reference ranges.

NAFLD — Biomarker and imaging surrogates for histological improvement specify actionable thresholds. Improvement in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or reduction in liver fat content by imaging in response to an intervention may indicate histological improvement in disease activity, and a guidance statement notes such changes can be used as a surrogate. A key point identifies an ALT reduction of ≥ 17 U/L as associated with histological improvement, noting thresholds may differ by histological response type.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115ErPff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Impact of using a lower ALT ULN on clinical practice — NHANES-based estimates and author stance: Applying the "maximum correct classification" ULN of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 29 IU/l for men and 22 IU/l for women would classify 36% of men and 28% of women as having elevated ALT. In a study of 235 asymptomatic workers, 27% had abnormal liver tests using lower ULN criteria and only six had any liver disease. Given increased liver-related mortality for ALT > 33 IU/l in men and > 25 IU/l in women, the authors state clinicians "should be cautious and concerned" and that "a national effort should be undertaken to standardize ALT levels across all populations".

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112TeHbB]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

### Hepatitis B [^114EdrHn]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy and aminotransferase thresholds — The purpose of a liver biopsy is to assess the degree of liver damage and to rule out other causes of liver disease, and liver biopsy is most useful in persons who do not meet clear cut guidelines for treatment; recent studies suggest that the upper limits of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) should be decreased to 30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women.

---

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114L8XjJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ALT and AST levels and mortality associations — population data: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 18 (AST > 18) was linked to a 3X increase in all cause mortality. Compared with men with AST or ALT ≥ 20 IU/l, those in the 30–39 IU/l group had an 8X (AST) or 9.5X (ALT) relative risk for liver-related death. In a cohort with standardized mortality ratios, values were 0.95 for normal ALT (defined as ULN 45 IU/l for men, 29 IU/l for females), 1.32 for 1–2× ULN, and 1.78 for > 2× ULN. Another study reported ALT 30–39 associated with relative risks of liver mortality 2.9 (2.4–3.5) and 9.5 (7.9–11.5) in men, and 3.8 (1.9–7.7) and 6.6 (1.5–25.6) in women. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) definitions of elevated ALT (30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women) was associated with liver-related mortality (11.2×) and diabetes-related mortality (3.3×), and another analysis found ALT > 43 IU/l for men and > 30 IU/l for women related to coronary heart disease.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

While our newly suggested thresholds of ULN for ALT levels might accelerate identification and earlier diagnosis of unhealthy subjects, particularly in women, prospective studies that consider ethnicity and lifestyle factors are required to confirm the new ULN value and prevent overdiagnosis of liver diseases, unnecessary medical investigation costs and personal anxiety, particularly in male patients.

### Updated upper limit of normal for serum alanine aminotransferase value in Vietnamese population [^115S7tZA]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The clinical diagnosis of acute and chronic illnesses is normally made from various basic blood assays. Transaminase blood chemical tests are used to evaluate liver function and for diagnosis and evaluation of outcome, prognosis and follow-up of patients with liver diseases. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is mainly presented in hepatocytes, and increased ALT level in the blood usually reflects hepatic cellular damage. ALT level has been widely used as a surrogate marker of liver injury and to evaluate therapeutic efficacy or reversal of liver diseases. Chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis due to various aetiologies, primary biliary cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and congenital disorders all exhibit increased serum ALT levels. Besides diurnal fluctuation, the level of serum ALT can also be affected by age, gender, body mass index (BMI), strenuous physical exercise, diet, metabolic status, fasting blood glucose, alcohol consumption and drug treatment.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112UbcFu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) screening context and ALT thresholds: NAFLD is usually asymptomatic and requires screening, but presently no screening guidelines exist outside of recognizing those at risk by weight categorization (BMI ≥ 85% for age and sex); proposed normative alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations are ≤ 25 U/L for boys and ≤ 22U/L for girls, while even normal or mildly elevated ALT (≥ 26 to 50 U/L for boys and ≥ 23 to 44 U/L for girls) has been associated with significant histologic abnormalities; high ALT levels would suggest a more advanced stage, and despite underestimating injury, ALT elevation is still an easily available screen, with fatty liver likely present in most pediatric obesity whether enzymes are high or not.

ALT and AST upper limit of normal proposals — published studies: Proposed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) upper limit of normal (ULN) values vary across studies, including 30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women (Prati et al.), 33 IU/l for men and 25 IU/l for women (Lee et al.), 29 IU/l for men and 22 IU/l for women (Ruhl and Everhart), and 40 IU/l for both men and women (Neuschwander-Tetri et al; gender not specified), while Wright et al. proposed 33 IU/l without a female value specified.

### Treatment of patients with hepatitis C and normal serum aminotransferase levels [^116duopG]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Approximately 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C have normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and another 40% have ALT levels that are less than twice the upper limit of the normal range. Most patients with normal ALT levels have mild degrees of inflammation with mild or no fibrosis, and the rate of disease progression is reduced compared with that in patients with elevated ALT levels. Some patients with normal ALT levels have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis on liver biopsy. Treatment of patients with normal ALT levels with either interferon monotherapy or interferon/ribavirin combination therapy has shown sustained virological response (SVR) rates that are equivalent to those achieved for patients with elevated ALT levels. Thus, patients with chronic hepatitis C should not be excluded from therapy based on ALT levels alone. The decision to initiate therapy with interferon and ribavirin should be based on a combination of factors independent of ALT levels including amount of fibrosis on liver biopsy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and viral level, patient age and motivation, and co-morbid illness, and the presence of other complicating conditions.

### Hepatitis C virus-infected patients with a persistently normal alanine aminotransferase: do they exist and is this really a group with mild disease? [^1115NXjM]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Opinion varies on whether or not hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with persistently normal aminotransferase (PNALT) levels represent a group with mild disease. To evaluate the risk of ALT flare and fibrosis progression in patients with PNALT followed up as part of the Trent HCV cohort. Treatment-naïve patients with an elevated ALT (n = 1140) or PNALT, the latter defined as either an ALT ≤ 30 IU/L (n = 43) or an ALT ≤ 40 IU/L (n = 87) on ≥ 2 occasions in the 6 months following diagnosis, and no ALT > 40 U/L were included. The likelihood of maintaining a PNALT ≤ 30 IU/L was 42.2% and PNALT ≤ 40 IU/L 41.7% at 3 years. The Ishak fibrosis score was ≥ 3 in 3.7%, 8.3% and 29.6% of patients with PNALT ≤ 30 IU/L, PNALT ≤ 40 IU/L and elevated ALT, respectively. Fibrosis progression between paired biopsies was similar for patients with PNALT ≤ 30 IU/L (0.33 ± 0.94 Ishak fibrosis points/year), PNALT ≤ 40 IU/L (0.35 ± 0.82) and elevated ALT (0.19 ± 0.48). The majority of those defined as PNALT subsequently have an abnormal ALT. They have a similar risk of disease progression to other HCV infected patients and, therefore, warrant the same consideration with regard to treatment.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

---

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^115UN9Jy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages and also significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present in persistently normal ALT levels HBV, HCV carriers or similarly, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of persons in the general population which may harbor a clinically significant liver disease behind the screen of normal alanine aminotransferase, more attention should be devoted to future research for alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

### Limiting the testing of AST: a diagnostically nonspecific enzyme [^112fbgcP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Annually, millions of pairs of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) tests are ordered. These enzymes are highly correlated, and ALT is far more specific diagnostically than AST. To reduce AST testing, we suggest measuring AST only when ALT exceeds a predetermined limit.

Methods

We derived the proportions of elevated ASTs that would not be measured based on 15 months of paired inpatient and outpatient ALT and AST data.

Results

For inpatients, a 35 U/L ALT limit for initiating AST testing would reduce AST testing by 51%, missing only 3% and 7.5% of ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively. In outpatients, AST testing can be reduced by more than 65%, with fewer missed elevated ASTs (0.5% and 2% of the ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively).

Conclusions

Conservatively, 100 million could be saved annually in the US health care budget by selectively limiting AST testing in just the US outpatient environment.

### Serum transaminase levels in boys with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy [^113JbcSw]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels are commonly used as biochemical indicators of hepatocellular injury but can also detect occult muscle disease. High concomitant serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels can point to muscle as the source of high transaminase levels. Nevertheless, clinicians may be reluctant to attribute high transaminase levels to muscle.

Methods

Study patients were boys with a genetic or biopsy-confirmed dystrophinopathy whose concomitant serum CPK, ALT, and AST levels were measured.

Results

We report 82 enzyme data sets from 46 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 9 with Becker muscular dystrophy. Our results show a linear relationship between serum CPK and serum ALT and AST and a logarithmic relationship between serum enzyme levels and age for boys with DMD. We developed a mathematical model to predict serum ALT and AST levels when the serum CPK level and age are known. For 6 boys, initial failure to consider muscle as a cause of high transaminase levels led to delay of diagnosis and extensive testing for hepatic dysfunction. A second group of 4 boys with known DMD were investigated for liver disease after high transaminase levels were detected. Serum transaminase levels were highest in ambulant boys with DMD, whose levels reached 1220 U/L (ALT) (22.6 times higher than upper-limit normal levels) and 801 U/L (AST) (12.3 times higher than upper-limit normal levels).

Conclusions

By recognizing muscle as a potential source of serum transaminase levels, clinicians can avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures, expedite clinical diagnosis, and avoid unnecessary cessation of concomitant drug therapy.

### Histological abnormalities in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and normal or mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase levels [^113AjA9t]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the histological spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children with normal, mildly elevated (26–50 U/L boys, 23–44 U/L girls), or elevated (> 50 U/L in boys, > 44 U/L in girls) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

Study Design

The Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network enrolls children aged 5–18 years with NAFLD. We analyzed baseline clinical and histological data from 91 children with suspected NAFLD and normal or mildly elevated ALT and liver biopsy analysis within 180 days of ALT measurement, and compared them with data from 392 children with elevated ALT.

Results

Seventeen of the 91 children with suspected NAFLD (19%) had a normal ALT level, and 74 (81%) had a mildly elevated ALT level. Overall, 45% of the biopsy specimens analyzed had steatosis ≥ 33%, 22% had grade ≥ 2 lobular inflammation, 81% had portal inflammation, 29% had ballooned hepatocytes, 35% had "suspicious/borderline" steatohepatitis, 8% had definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, 34% had an NAFLD activity score ≥ 4, and 46% had fibrosis (38% mild/moderate and 8% bridging/cirrhosis). Marked steatosis (50% vs 24%) and fibrosis (54% vs 12%) were significantly more common in the patients with mildly elevated ALT compared with those with normal ALT, with no difference in ballooning, inflammation, or NAFLD activity score ≥ 4 between the 2 groups. Fibrosis stage 3/4 was seen in none of the children with normal ALT, in 9% of those with mildly elevated ALT, and in 15% of those with elevated ALT.

Conclusion

Liver biopsy specimens from children with NAFLD with normal or mildly elevated ALT levels show significant histological abnormalities, including advanced fibrosis in children with mildly elevated ALT. Thus, measurement of ALT may underestimate liver injury in NAFLD. The use of appropriate ALT cutoff levels can help identify children at risk for more severe disease.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112e4GN6]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B treatment initiation — ALT and HBV DNA thresholds for immune-active disease emphasize injury plus viremia: The primary indication for treatment initiation in a person with immune-active disease is the presence of significant liver injury or fibrosis, as reflected by elevated ALT levels or moderate-to-severe necroinflammatory activity on histology and/or fibrosis plus active HBV viremia. Clinical trials in adults typically required ALT elevation 1.3–2.0 times the laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN). Normal ALT levels are reported as ≤ 30 U/L for males and < 19 U/L for females, and using these cutoffs, the recommendation is to consider treatment of adults with ALT values of ≥ 2 times the ULN (> 60 U/L for males and > 38 U/L for females). The HBV DNA definition of immune-active disease derives from historical trial cutoffs with supportive natural history data showing increased relative risk of liver-related complications when HBV DNA exceeds 2,000 IU/mL.

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^113Yditq]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis. Less common causes include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, muscle disorders) can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels. Initial testing should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate. Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated for six months or more.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114bdCmA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — actions by aminotransferase severity specify etiologic evaluation thresholds and urgent referral criteria. For ALT and/or AST levels > 5X ULN, evaluate for viral hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and NAFLD, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and consider drugs/supplement‑related, ischemic, and DILI causes. For 5–15X ULN, also assess for acute hepatitis A, B, and C in addition to etiologies for AST/ALT elevation less than 5× ULN. For > 15X ULN, or massive ALT > 10,000 IU/L, also assess for acetaminophen toxicity and ischemic hepatopathy (shock liver). A patient with acute hepatitis plus elevated prothrombin time and/or encephalopathy requires immediate referral to a liver specialist. All are Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Are simple noninvasive scoring systems for fibrosis reliable in patients with NAFLD and normal ALT levels? [^115yovUs]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and many affected individuals have normal-range alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. There is a need for a robust screening tool to triage individuals with advanced fibrosis for specialist care.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tests in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and normal levels of ALT.

Methods

Patients presenting at a fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included in the study. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio, BARD, FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores were calculated.

Results

A total of 305 patients were included [70 with normal ALT levels (women: ALT ≤ 30 IU/l, men: ALT ≤ 45 IU/l) and 235 with elevated levels]. In total, 24% of patients with normal ALT levels and 17% of those with elevated ALT levels had advanced fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3–4). The FIB-4 performed best in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with normal ALT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86, 82% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 92% negative predictive value). The sensitivity of the AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD fibrosis scores for advanced fibrosis was good in patients with normal ALT levels (94, 94 and 82%, respectively), but the specificity was low (44, 26 and 51%, respectively). The FIB-4 yielded best results in patients with elevated ALT levels. Using the FIB-4, 61% of patients with normal ALT levels and 63% of those with elevated ALT levels could avoid liver biopsy to exclude advanced fibrosis. In contrast, AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD scores would have led to a high proportion of patients with mild disease having to undergo a biopsy.

Conclusion

The FIB-4 yielded good results in patients with normal or elevated ALT levels, reliably excluding advanced fibrosis and reducing the need for liver biopsy.

### Can AST / ALT ratio indicate recovery after acute paracetamol poisoning? [^11432eW4]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Paracetamol (acetaminophen or APAP) is the most common pharmaceutical exposure in the US. Elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels indicate hepatic toxicity. AST and ALT levels rise in similar proportions but later decline at different rates, with AST falling more rapidly than ALT.

Objective

To determine whether the AST/ALT ratio can indicate that a patient has passed the time of peak AST concentration.

Methods

We retrospectively identified cases of patients hospitalized for acute APAP poisoning by querying the pharmacy database of all patients treated with acetylcysteine (NAC) from January 1, 2001 to March 19, 2013. We included all patients with severe APAP poisoning, defined as AST or ALT greater than 1000 IU/L. Patients who were given NAC for other indications, those without APAP poisoning, and those receiving liver transplantation were excluded. We then recorded paired AST and ALT concentrations from each patient's hospital course. We classified each pair as clearly post-peak or not, and calculated the AST/ALT ratio for each pair of values. We compared different thresholds of AST/ALT ratio in increments of 0.1 to find the optimal value that reliably indicated resolving transaminases.

Results

We identified 1820 patients who received NAC during the study period. Of these, 333 received NAC for suspected poisoning by APAP. After excluding patients without severe APAP poisoning, other diagnoses explaining transaminase elevations, and patients who underwent liver transplantation, we had 37 evaluable patients with 343 evaluable pairs of AST and ALT concentrations. An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 was 99% sensitive for identifying patients with resolving transaminases.

Conclusion

An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 following severe hepatoxicity from paracetamol poisoning appears to be highly predictive of recovery in patients treated with NAC. This has potential to be an indicator of safe discontinuation of NAC treatment.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^116AtZym]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### Consider muscle disease in children with elevated transaminase [^1129REvX]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are markers of hepatocellular injury but are highly concentrated in muscle cells. Consequently, muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, lead to hypertransaminasemia. Elevation in ALT and AST is most striking during the early stages of disease, before onset of or when only subtle signs of muscle disease are present. Thus, the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST may be the presenting sign of muscle disease in many children and provides an opportunity for early diagnosis. Many physicians, however, pursue extensive workup for liver disease in children who present with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. This results in delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment and increased expense and may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures. We report 12 patients with muscle disease who presented with a variety of symptoms and were found to have an incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. We propose a rapid screening process for evaluating children with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST to shorten the time to diagnosis of muscle disease.

### Chronic hepatitis C in patients with persistently normal alanine transaminase levels [^114XUHEC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Many patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) have persistently normal serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. We compared characteristics of chronic hepatitis C patients with patients with normal and elevated ALT levels using data from 3 randomized phase III trials of peginterferon alfa-2a (40 kDa).

Methods

The characteristics of 480 patients with normal ALT values (on ≥ 3 occasions without any increases in ALT level over a 6- to 18-month period) and 1993 patients with elevated ALT levels were compared. Sixty-eight of the 480 patients with normal ALT levels were randomized to no treatment and monitored for 72 weeks.

Results

More patients with normal ALT levels than patients with elevated ALT levels were women (59% vs 32%; P < .01). The serum HCV RNA titer was significantly lower in patients with normal ALT levels (P < .01 vs in patients with elevated ALT levels). Patients with normal ALT levels had significantly lower inflammation and fibrosis scores on liver biopsy examination than patients with elevated ALT levels, but almost two-thirds had portal fibrosis and 10% had bridging fibrosis. No correlation between baseline ALT activity, HCV RNA level, and liver histology was observed in patients with normal ALT levels. During the 72-week follow-up period, ALT activity elevated above the upper limit of normal in 53% of the untreated patients with normal levels of ALT. None became HCV RNA undetectable.

Conclusions

Chronic hepatitis C patients with normal ALT levels should be evaluated in a similar manner as patients with elevated ALT levels because they are at risk for developing significant liver disease. The decision to treat with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin should be based on multiple factors, rather than on ALT levels alone.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### Serum alanine aminotransferase in skeletal muscle diseases [^112eRcGS]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although elevation of the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) following liver injury is well known, confusion exists concerning skeletal muscle injury as the cause of this rise. We reviewed the records of 16 patients who had muscle necrosis without evidence of liver disease. The patients were divided into three groups: extreme exercise, polymyositis, and seizures. All patients exhibited markedly elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels consistent with muscle injury. In acute cases, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT were both elevated, and the AST/ALT ratio was greater than 3, but this ratio approached 1 after a few days because of a faster decline in AST. In conclusion, this difference in half-life accounts for the comparable AST and ALT levels in our cases with chronic muscle injury.

### Age-and sex-related reference ranges of alanine aminotransferase levels in children: European paediatric HCV network [^114ss68e]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are commonly used to indicate liver damage. Although elevated levels indicate possible liver injury, abnormalities, or disease, some patients with "normal" ALT levels have minimal to mild liver disease. Recently, ALT reference ranges for adults were queried and revised ranges proposed with lower upper limits of normality. The appropriateness of current paediatric ALT reference ranges is unclear.

Material and Methods

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-uninfected children from the European Paediatric HCV Network represent a large population of healthy children born to HCV-infected mothers, with ALT observations collected prospectively from birth. Linear regression identified factors associated with ALT levels while accounting for within-child repeated measurements. ALT centiles stratified by sex were calculated using maximum penalized likelihood methods and LMS software.

Results

A total of 1293 HCV-uninfected children had 5011 ALT measurements during follow-up. ALT levels significantly decreased with increasing age, whilst ALT levels were significantly lower in girls than boys. Reference cutoffs representing the 95th centiles before 18 months of age were 60 U/L for boys and 55 U/L for girls, decreasing to 40 U/L for boys and 35 U/L for girls after 18 months of age.

Conclusions

These reference ranges represent a unique investigation of ALT levels in a healthy child population. We show lower and more detailed age-related cutoffs of normality than available. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant effect of sex on ALT reference ranges, which has not previously been described in children younger than 5 years of age.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Significant prevalence of histologic disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B and mildly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels [^114Rpghz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Serum ALT remains the most accessible test available to clinicians for monitoring chronic hepatitis B virus infection, but appropriate action when ALT levels are only mildly elevated is ambiguous in standard guidelines.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of significant histology in a patient population with mildly elevated serum ALT levels. A total of 193 consecutive patients were selected and divided into 2 groups according to HBeAg status. Patients were further divided into cohorts on the basis of their highest ALT elevation during follow-up and whether it was 1–1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), 1.5–2 times the ULN, or greater than twice the ULN. The ULN that was used is 30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women.

Results

In all cohorts there was a substantial fraction of patients with histologic disease as evaluated by liver biopsy. HBeAg-negative patients were older, had lower viral load, and had a higher prevalence of disease. After adjustments for age, HBeAg status and HBV DNA viral load were not predictors of significant histology. Age > 35 years, male gender, and increasing ALT levels were predictors for significant histology on multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

A substantial proportion of patients with mildly elevated ALT levels have significant histologic disease. The prevalence increased with the higher ALT levels and age.

Laboratory studies

Laboratory study results were generally unremarkable, except for alanine transaminase (ALT; Fig. 9) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; Fig. 10) levels, which were elevated in some participants. Those with elevated ALT/AST values showed improvement over time, especially among the younger patients. The liver transaminases were not associated with elevated total bilirubin levels and did not reach levels indicative of severe liver disease.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^11799txx]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10% to 20% of the general population has elevated liver chemistry levels, including aspartate and alanine transaminases. Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. The most common causes of mildly elevated transaminase levels (two to five times the upper limit of normal) are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes are alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic causes are celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and pregnancy-associated liver disease. Initial laboratory testing assesses complete blood cell count with platelets, blood glucose, lipid profile, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. If MASLD is suspected, the FIB-4 Index Score or NAFLD Fibrosis Score can be used to predict which patients are at risk for fibrosis and may benefit from further testing or referral to a hepatologist. All patients with elevated transaminases should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol use, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs.

### Liver biochemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113pbPRG]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to elevated liver biochemistries in approximately half of patients on presentation. To date, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19.

Approach and Results

A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. The mean age was 57 years, 65% were male, and 28% were Hispanic. At the study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 were discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for a median of 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, whereas alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak. Statin use was common before (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and nonusers. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003), and peak ALT (220 vs. 52; P = 0.002) were higher in intubated patients.

Conclusions

AST-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in COVID-19, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.

### Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase decrease with age in longitudinal analysis [^1127Kf3R]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

An increased level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a marker of liver injury. The mean ALT level has been reported to decrease with age; we performed a longitudinal analysis to determine whether serum levels of ALT changes with age among community-dwelling, older adults in the US.

Methods

We analyzed clinical data from 2 cohorts of individuals who participated in the Rancho Bernardo Study, in Southern CA. The first cohort comprised 1073 community-dwelling participants (59% women); clinical data was collected from 1984–1987 and 1992–1997. The second cohort comprised 416 participants (64% women); data was collected from 1984–1987, 1992–1997, and 1997–1999. Demographic, metabolic covariates, ALT, bilirubin, and albumin were measured. Changes in individual ALT over time were examined in unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses.

Results

At the baseline visit, the patients' mean age was 65.7 years and body mass index was 24.9 kg/m(2). In cohort 1, the mean levels of ALT decreased with age by 10% (from 21 to 19 IU/L) between the time periods of 1984–1987 and 1992–1997 (P < .0001). In cohort 2, they decreased by 20% (from 20 to 16 IU/L) between the time periods of 1984–1987 and 1997–1999 (P < .0001). Categorically-defined increases in ALT also decreased with age (P < .0001). Results remained consistent in sex-specific analyses and after adjusting for metabolic syndrome components, alcohol use, bilirubin, and serum levels of albumin (P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a longitudinal analysis, we observed that levels of ALT decrease with age, independent of sex, metabolic factors, alcohol use, and results from commonly used liver function tests (bilirubin and albumin). When interpreting serum levels of ALT, physicians should consider patients' age especially in the elderly.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116GN7V6]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Assessment and management notes limitations of liver enzymes and preferred imaging for steatosis. Aminotransferase levels may be normal in advanced NASH and should not exclude disease with clinically significant fibrosis. Most laboratory "normal" ALT thresholds are high; as a general rule, ALT > 30 U/L should be considered abnormal. Standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) may be used to identify steatosis and MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) can quantify steatosis.

### Relation of alanine aminotransferase levels to cardiovascular events and statin efficacy [^114xYjVt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The relation between hepatic serum markers within the normal range and cardiovascular risk is uncertain. We sought to address this issue within a prospective randomized trial of statin therapy. Men and women (n = 17,515) free of cardiovascular disease participating in a randomized placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin 20 mg/day had baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) below < 40 IU/l and were followed prospectively for the first-ever cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the relative risks of these events according to increasing tertiles and each SD increase in baseline ALT levels. ALT levels at study entry, all within the normal range, were inversely associated with age, smoking status, and inflammation and were positively associated with male gender, alcohol use, and triglycerides. Incident cardiovascular event rates were highest in those in the lowest tertile of baseline ALT; specifically, incidence rates were 1.43, 0.98, and 0.85 per 100 person-years of exposure for those in the lowest, middle, and highest tertile of baseline ALT within the normal range, respectively (p < 0.001). These inverse effects remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment for a wide range of vascular risk factors risk markers such that each higher SD unit of ALT was associated with an 18% lower event rate (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.93, p = 0.002). The efficacy of statin therapy was not modified by baseline ALT level. In conclusion, increasing ALT levels within the normal range are inversely associated with future cardiovascular risk but had limited clinical utility and also did not modify the efficacy of statin therapy.

### Liver injury in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YT6gE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is a global health threat. To inform the liver community on the potential relevance of COVID-19, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data on liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Google Scholar through 22 March according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Pooled data were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

A total of 14 studies combining data from 2.871 patients were identified. The prevalence of pre-existing liver disease was reported at 3.1%. The pooled prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20–32%] and 19% (95% CI, 14–26%), respectively. Only two studies reported the prevalence of elevated liver function tests according to normal ward versus ICU and here the frequency of elevated levels of AST was 50% and 62% versus ALT 40.8% and thus quantitatively higher in ICU-treated patients. Mean levels of absolute AST levels were 33U/L (95% CI, 30.21–36.09), while mean ALT levels were 31U/L (95% CI, 27.52–34.57). Cholestatic liver function tests were only incompletely reported in 510 patients. Here, mean levels of alkaline phosphatase were 71U/L across three studies, and mean levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase were 40.6U/L across four studies.

Conclusions

Emerging data on LFTs in COVID-19 are heterogeneous indicating mild LFTs involvement in every fourth to fifth patients with numerical more prevalent AST over ALT elevations. Prospective studies are needed to define the clinical relevance of liver injury in COVID-19.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^115fpMxt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread as an epidemic throughout China, finally resulting in a worldwide pandemic. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, up to 02 June 2020 a total of 6,245,352 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 376,427 deaths.

Pneumonia and respiratory failure appear to be the most frequent serious manifestations of COVID-19, while the spectrum of illness severity ranges from mild (most cases) to critical disease, with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. However, despite its "respiratory preference", COVID-19 can be recognized as a systemic disease with multiple organ involvement. In this context, recently published data have described abnormal liver function tests, mainly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as the most common extrapulmonary finding in COVID-19 cases.

### Association between serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance in euthyroid and non-diabetic adults [^117F5PgT]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance (IR) in a population of healthy individuals.

Methods

We define IR with a cut-off point of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.8. For aspartate aminotransferase (AST), we consider elevated values > 30 U/L in women and values > 36 U/L in men. For alanine aminotransferase (ALT), we consider elevated values > 30 U/L in women and values > 40 U/L in men. We performed a crude and adjusted generalized linear model from Poisson family with robust variance, in order to evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and IR. The associations were presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Results

We included 261 participants in the study. The median age was 39 years (31–45) and 23.7% of the participants were men. The prevalence of elevated serum transaminase for AST and ALT were, 13.8% and 26.1%, respectively. The prevalence of IR was 34.1%. In the crude analysis we found statistical significance between elevated AST and ALT with IR (PR = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.33–4.34 and PR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.88–3.30; respectively). However, in the multivariate analysis, the association only remained statistically significance with ALT, but lost its significance with AST, PR = 1.90; CI 95%: 1.31–2.77 and a PR = 1.23; CI 95%: 0.93–1.61; respectively.

Conclusion

Elevated serum levels of ALT were associated with insulin resistance. ALT could be used in clinical practice as an additional tool to assess IR in apparently healthy people.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^117G2zgw]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of drugs are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which has a wide spectrum of clinical and biochemical manifestations, ranging from transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases (TAEAT) to acute liver failure. Most cases (> 90%) of DILI resolve fully within several weeks after drug discontinuation, although some cases can persist as chronic low-level enzyme elevations for 6 to 12 months despite the drug cessation. Drug adaptation may also occur, defined as the phenomenon whereby an agent fails to cause progressive worsening of DILI beyond what are generally transient, low-level, asymptomatic reversible alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations despite the drug continuation.

Although international working groups have defined threshold levels of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to distinguish acute DILI from mild elevations, the clinical significance of higher level (ie, grade 3 [G3] and grade 4 [G4]) asymptomatic transient elevations has not been extensively studied, especially in oncology. In addition, there are gaps in the understanding of mechanisms leading to significantly elevated aminotransferase levels, specifically in cases of asymptomatic and transient presentations without clinical signs of hepatocyte damage.

Herein, TAEAT is used to indicate the occurrence of transient asymptomatic G3 and G4 elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) without associated elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase or corresponding histologic liver abnormalities. A review of TAEAT in oncology clinical trials and clinical practice is provided. In addition, the gaps in our current understanding of the phenomenon are identified, including those areas where consensus guidelines and practical suggestions for clinicians involved in managing oncology patients with elevated aminotransferases may offer value.

### Underestimation of metabolic unhealthiness and overestimation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112xqJtP]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Das et al. report serum ALT of 29.46 ± 26.4 U/L in controls and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) with elevated ALT (> 40 U/L) in only 2.3% of the population from the Birbhum district. A markedly higher prevalence of elevated ALT in step 2 of Mukherjee et al. may be the result of using more sensitive cut-offs, derived from the Italian population, to define elevated ALT. Another concern is considering every elevated ALT as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Surprisingly, the proportions of participants with elevated ALT were not remarkably different between subjects with IFG/DM (42%) and normal glycemia (39%). More surprisingly, the proportions of persistently elevated ALT were higher in metabolically healthy non-obese and obese groups than the respective MU groups; also, the ALT levels were higher in the obese metabolically healthy group than in obese MU groups irrespective of the number of additional risk factors. These observations question elevated ALT as a marker of dysmetabolism in the study population. Although this might have partly resulted from graduating normal glycemic status participants with elevated ALT, not those with normal ALT, from step 2 to step 3, a potential role for other causes of transaminitis needs consideration. Notably, the contribution of alcohol consumption to transaminitis was underweighted by presuming its role as nil at the community level. So, there may be an overestimation of NAFLD.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^1128Pue2]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Management algorithm for HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-positive persons without cirrhosis states that antiviral therapy decisions depend on HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with an upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT of 35 U/L for males and 25 U/L for females recommended to guide decisions. Individuals meeting criteria for immune active chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are recommended for treatment, whereas those meeting the strict definition of immune-tolerant are generally not recommended for treatment unless older (≥ 40 years), have significant fibrosis (≥ F2) or have another reason for treatment; those in the indeterminate phase warrant a shared-decision making approach with consideration of potential risks and benefits. HBeAg-positive individuals with HBV DNA levels < 20,000 IU/mL are extremely rare, but the treatment approach would be the same as those with HBV DNA ≥ 20,000 IU/mL.

### Low alanine aminotransferase activity in older people is associated with greater long-term mortality [^112BVebn]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To find possible association between liver enzymes and mortality in older people.

Design

A prospective cohort study.

Setting

Jerusalem.

Participants

A systematically selected representative sample of 455 70-year-old ambulatory individuals was prospectively followed for 12 years.

Measurements

An extensive social and medical profile was developed at age 70 using a detailed interview and physical and ancillary examination. Information on mortality was obtained annually. Differences in survival between subjects stratified according to liver enzyme levels were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable survival analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model were performed to determine the association between liver enzyme levels at age 70 and mortality over 12 years.

Results

Median alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity of the study population was 11.00 U/L for women and 13.00 U/L for men. Twelve-year survival rates for women with ALT below and above the median levels were similar (78%). For men, these rates were 54% and 65%, respectively (P < .001). Proportional hazards models demonstrated that this greater mortality risk was independent of numerous common risk factors for mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–2.19). Adding an interaction between sex and low ALT to the model demonstrated a higher risk of mortality for men with low ALT levels (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.15–5.08). No such risk was demonstrated for the other liver enzymes.

Conclusion

ALT activity represents a strong and independent surrogate marker for mortality in community-dwelling elderly men.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology NAFLD special interest group [^116bPbMD]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

### Association of alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) with the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI): a cross-sectional study [^116JZ73i]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The liver damage related to insulin resistance progresses to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Therefore, early identification of metabolic abnormalities could be useful for initiating treatment and reducing the progression or even reverting the problem. Accordingly, we propose predicting the HIRI level using a single ALT measurement. According to model 3 (subjects with MetS), for each 10 IU/L of increment in ALT, the HIRI would increase approximately 0.7 units. However, a higher increment in HIRI could be expected if the patient has more severe impaired glucose metabolism. In subjects with IFG that corresponds to subjects with greater hepatic glucose production and hepatic IR, and in those with IGT that corresponds to subjects with impaired systemic IR (models 4 and 5) for every 10 unit increment in ALT, HIRI increased by 0.9 and 1.0 unit respectively. In subjects with T2DM (model 6), an increment of 3 units of HIRI could be expected for the same 10 IU/L increment in ALT. This progressive increment in ALT with worsening glucose metabolism, possibly reflects how far along the patient is in the natural history of T2DM. The degree of hepatic insulin resistance could be predicted using the formula HIRI = constant + beta (ALT level). The value of the constant and beta could be obtained from Table 4, depending on the patient diagnosis. If the patient does not have a metabolic diagnosis yet, we suggest using the information presented in model 1. We cannot confirm the association between ALT and fatty liver disease with the current design, however our hypothesis is that individuals with higher plasma concentrations of ALT and/or higher levels of HIRI could have an underlying liver disease that warrants further investigation. In addition, the benefit of metformin treatment in improving HIRI was recently reported by our group. Similarly, another report has shown that metformin reduces ALT levels. Perhaps, subjects identified with high normal or elevated serum ALT levels, without any other known liver disease, could benefit from metformin treatment to reduce hepatic insulin resistance. However, this point warrants further investigation in prospective studies. It is important to mention that our results could be potentially biased since we included patients that had an indication for testing for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, in the 113 patients that had no metabolic abnormalities we did not find any association between ALT and HIRI (Table 3, r = 0.03, p = 0.744; Table 4, model 2, beta = 0.005, p = 0.221). These results suggest that the increase in ALT in our patients is related to the metabolic derangement.

Fig. 4 — Algorithm for pediatric MASLD screening and evaluation outlines ALT-based thresholds, reassessment, and escalation steps. Screen alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 10 years and older, and consider rechecking ALT every 1–2 years based on risk factors with lifestyle modifications to be offered to all. Initial abnormal thresholds are Male ALT ≥ 26 and Female ALT ≥ 22; if ALT is still elevated after lifestyle modifications for 6 months, laboratory work-up for increased ALT can be considered by the primary care provider (PCP) depending on setting. Red flags include chronic fatigue, GI bleed, splenomegaly, ↑ INR/direct bilirubin, liver failure, and younger age of presentation (< 8yr). An "in particular" higher threshold is noted: Male ALT ≥ 52 and Female ALT ≥ 44.

### Abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels in patients with moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation result in an increased risk of obstetric complications [^113uUeUm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To explore the effect of abnormally elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on pregnancy outcomes in patients with moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) at disease onset.

Methods

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted between January 1, 2014 and October 31, 2021. A total of 3550 fresh in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection embryo transfer cycles were included, using Golan's three-degree, five-level classification to diagnose patients with OHSS. According to the patient's ALT level after diagnosis of OHSS, 123 (3.46%) patients with moderate-to-severe OHSS were divided into two groups. A control group included 3427 (96.54%) non-OHSS patients, and 91 (2.56%) abnormal ALT patients were matched with the control group for propensity scores.

Results

There was no difference in baseline data between the abnormal ALT and matched control groups. The incidence of obstetric complications was significantly higher in the abnormal ALT group than in the matched control group (P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, the incidence of obstetric complications in the abnormal ALT group was still higher than that in the normal ALT group (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In patients with moderate and severe OHSS, higher ALT levels resulted in an increased risk of obstetric and neonatal complications.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^113YbCSp]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B without cirrhosis, HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative — management algorithm states that the decision to initiate antiviral therapy depends on HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with an upper limit of normal for ALT of 35 U/L for males and 25 U/L for females recommended to guide management decisions. Those who meet criteria for immune active chronic hepatitis B are recommended for treatment, whereas those meeting the strict definition of inactive are not recommended for treatment. Indeterminate phases warrant further evaluation for other causes of liver enzyme elevation if ALT > ULN and HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL, or consideration of risks for hepatocellular carcinoma if ALT < 2xULN and HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL; for those in the indeterminant phase, antiviral therapy is suggested using a shared decision-making approach with regular monitoring recommended for those not on antiviral therapy and reevaluation of the decision at each follow-up visit if treatment has not been initiated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, overinvestigation and considerably increased costs.

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

An important consideration when evaluating the risk of hepatic fibrosis is that both AST and ALT can be normal even in the setting of cirrhosis, and the utility of the AST:ALT ratio in adults persists even if both values are within the normal reference interval. While it is hard to justify the routine analysis of both AST and ALT together on every liver blood test request, a strategy not supported by the data from the BALLETS study, subsequent testing of AST (or ALT depending which one is undertaken first) to calculate the AST:ALT ratio is clearly desirable. From a patient and cost perspective this is likely to be more cost-effective if performed by 'reflex' on the same sera following the detection of an abnormal ALT or GGT. To date there is no firm evidence that this is a cost-effective approach, although the results of a pilot study of such 'reflex' testing and additional up-front aetiology screen testing from Wales and Scotland are awaited.

### Hepatitis B core antibody positivity is not associated with risk of transaminase elevation following switch to dual antiretroviral therapy [^116DA3yB]. AIDS (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the time to grade ≥ 1 liver function test increase (LFTI), defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level at least 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, in accordance with the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events. Specifically, the upper limits of normal used in our analyses were 41 IU/l for ALT and 40 IU/l for AST in men, and 33 IU/l for ALT and 32 IU/l for AST in women.

Secondary outcomes measures included time to grade ≥ 3 LFTI (i.e. more than five times the upper limit of normal), transaminase evolution over time after the switch and the rate of transaminase elevations during follow-up. Transaminase levels were typically measured every 4–6 months, in accordance with routine clinical practice. For the purpose of analysis, wherever necessary, values were grouped into 6-month intervals (± 90 days) to account for variability in follow-up timing and ensure comparability across participants.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^115heM8y]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies of liver injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients

In a retrospective single-center study of 138 confirmed patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19, the median AST and ALT levels were reported to be significantly higher in patients who had been treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), rather than in non-ICU beds: 52 (range: 30–70) U/L vs. 29 (21–38) U/L, P < 0.001; and 35 (19–57) U/L vs. 23 (15–36) U/L, P = 0.007, respectively. However, in this cohort, the percentage of patients with AST/ALT elevation was not provided.

Similarly, in a recently published cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 37% of the patients presented AST elevation, while the median levels of ALT and total bilirubin were 32 (21–50) U/L and 0.68 (0.56–0.81) mg/dL, respectively. In accordance with previous reports, the authors also revealed that ICU patients experienced slightly higher levels of AST, ALT and total bilirubin than non-ICU patients.

Cai et al reported that 8.7% of 298 patients infected by COVID-19 presented abnormal AST and ALT levels. Cholestatic enzymes, such as g-glutamyl transferase/alkaline phosphatase (GGT/ALP), were also slightly elevated in a few patients (3.1% and 3.0%). The incidence of liver injury in severe patients (36.2%) was markedly higher than that in mild patients (9.6%).

A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases did not harmonize with previous findings, since AST/ALT levels did not differ significantly between severe and non-severe cases: (28.89 ± 31.83 U/L vs. 43.87 ± 47.8 U/L, P > 0.05; and 27.98 ± 25.8 U/L vs. 44.13 ± 36.26 U/L, P > 0.05, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Fast-food-based hyper-alimentation can induce rapid and profound elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase in healthy subjects [^112HRQAf]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

Liver disease is often identified by asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferases, as these are commonly included in serum chemistry panels drawn on healthy individuals. However, incidentally discovered elevations of serum aminotransferases often lead to lengthy, expensive and potentially invasive diagnostic evaluations. Analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in the United States showed a prevalence of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to be as high as 7.9%. This figure is considerably higher than the 1–4% prevalence rate reported in earlier studies, and indicates that the prevalence of abnormal liver tests in the general population has increased. Although many cases of elevated aminotransferase levels can be explained by the consumption of large quantities of alcohol or the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a great number of cases typically remain unexplained. In both men and women, elevations of aminotransferases are strongly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, such as abdominal adiposity, high plasma glucose levels and dyslipidaemia, – Indeed, high serum levels of AST and ALT are associated with future risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Most cases of aminotransferase elevations in seemingly healthy subjects have hitherto generally been attributed to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver biopsy studies of patients referred for aminotransferase elevations have demonstrated liver steatosis as the most common histological finding. – Interestingly, it was recently shown that subjects with NAFLD and elevated aminotransferases have a significant risk of developing end-stage liver disease and a lower chance of survival mainly because of cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the widespread misconception that NAFLD is a mild disease with good prognosis has been highlightedand it is likely that physicians will be more concerned when facing patients with elevated aminotransferases. However, in most asymptomatic individuals with high aminotransferase levels, the elevation is intermittent and normal levels are found when testing is repeated within months.

### The mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 is dispensable in the liver and its absence induces mitohormesis to protect liver from drug-induced injury [^1168AXTP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Histology of OPA1-KO livers showed no sign of necrosis and injury (Fig. 2a). OPA1-KO livers showed no pathology, but had enlarged hepatocytes, similar to previous observation with OPA1-KO by Alb-Cre. Quantification by the number of cells per unit area showed a smaller number of cells in OPA1-KO liver, indicating cell enlargement (Fig. 2b). To test the effect of OPA1 LKO on liver function, we tested serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). We found that OPA1 deletion for 8–12 weeks increased both ALT and AST levels (Fig. 2c, d). The mean ALT of control mice was 22.5 U/L whereas that of OPA1-LKO mice 72.5 U/L. Similarly, the mean AST of floxed and OPA1-LKO mice were 50 and 134 U/L, respectively. Although these increases were statistically significant, both these ALT and AST values are within the reference range of C57BL/6 (22–133 U/L for ALT and 46–221 U/L for AST). It is likely that the increases of serum ALT and AST are a reflection of the increased hepatic expression of them in OPA1-LKO mice (see below), and may not be an increase of liver injury. Consistent with this notion, the cell injury marker serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was not different in floxed and OPA1-KO mice (Fig. 2e). Immunoblotting of liver lysates for caspase 3 showed no increase of the cleaved active form in OPA1-KO liver, indicating no apoptotic cell death by OPA1 KO (Fig. 2f). Quantification indicates rather decreased caspase cleavage in OPA1-KO liver (Fig. 2g). Accordingly, there was no 89-kDa PARP-1 fragment generated by active caspase 3 in OPA1-KO liver (Fig. 2f). Two PARP-1 fragments in the 55–75 kDa range were observed, presumably produced by cathepsins; however, one of these was rather decreased in OPA1-KO livers (Fig. 2f). In addition, OPA1-KO livers showed a small decrease in the LC3-II/I ratio compared with control livers, suggesting a decrease in autophagy (Fig. 2f, g). This series of observations indicate that OPA1 KO in fully developed mouse liver causes no ill effect on hepatic viability, liver function and animal health while restricting age-dependent weight gain, improving glucose tolerance, and enhancing whole body metabolism.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

AST and ALT ratio interpretation — The ratio of AST to ALT may be useful in determining the etiology of abnormal liver tests; for most liver conditions including chronic viral hepatitis and NAFLD, ALT levels are > AST levels; however, ~90% of patients with alcoholic liver disease have AST > ALT, and > 70% have an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2; AST > ALT can also be seen in cirrhosis, although the AST:ALT ratio is typically not ≥ 2:1; in hepatitis C virus patients, non-cirrhotics had an AST/ALT ratio of 0.60, while the mean ratio in cirrhotics was 1.05; liver biopsy is most commonly done to assess the grade and stage of disease severity and may be useful to confirm suspected diagnoses including Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase and mortality in the United States population [^111hSzwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities are markers of liver injury, but may also be associated with other diseases and death. In a prospective, national, population-based sample, we examined whether elevated ALT and GGT were associated with increased risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality.

Methods

Death certificate-based 12-year mortality was analyzed among 14,950 adult participants in the third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988–1994, who were negative for markers of viral hepatitis B and C. Abnormal ALT was defined as > 30 U/L in men or > 19 U/L in women, and abnormal GGT as > 51 U/L in men or > 33 U/L in women.

Results

Cumulative mortality was 13.9% from all causes, including 4.2% from cardiovascular disease, 4.2% from neoplasms, 0.44% from diabetes, and 0.13% from liver disease. In multivariate-adjusted analyses, elevated ALT was not associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.6). ALT elevation was associated with deaths from liver disease (HR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.1–31.9), but not from cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.56–1.4), neoplasms (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.65–1.5), or diabetes (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.65–9.1). All-cause mortality increased with elevated GGT (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.8), as did mortality from liver disease (HR, 13.0; 95% CI, 2.4–71.5), neoplasms (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.01–2.2), and diabetes (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4–7.6), but not from cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.80–2.0).

Conclusions

In the US population, elevated GGT was associated with mortality from all causes, liver disease, cancer, and diabetes, while ALT was associated only with liver disease mortality.

### The dynamics of liver function test abnormalities after malaria infection: a retrospective observational study [^114sGkS3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

An elevated ALT level > 3 × ULN was identified in 15.1% (N = 130/861) of all cases with LFT measurements. New cases were identified up to Day 9 after diagnosis. Moderate, severe, and very severe peak elevations were observed in 76/130, 41/130, and 13/130 cases, respectively (Table 2). The peak ALT elevation identified was 25.8 × ULN and occurred on Day 4. Of the 130 cases with an ALT level > 3 × ULN, 64.6% peaked in the early period (N = 84/130) and 35.4% (N = 46/130) in the delayed period. No cases had peak LFT elevations in the late period. Aspartate transaminase elevation was identified at rates similar to ALT elevation, although the temporal distribution of peak AST elevation appeared to favor a slightly earlier onset (Figure 2). Transaminase elevation appeared to resolve largely within the follow-up period.

The median (IQR) ALT/AST ratio of all LFT measurements on Day 0 was 1.0 (0.7 to 1.2). The ALT/AST ratio progressively increased to consistently > 1 after Day 4. There was no difference in the ALT/AST ratio based on infective species.

Elevated bilirubin, ALT, and AST levels were observed significantly more frequently in P. falciparum than in P. vivax cases (Table 2).

Of all cases with LFTs undertaken, there were 54 cases with normal (N = 11/861) or mildly elevated (N = 43/861) LFTs on the day of diagnosis that subsequently went on to develop moderate or greater abnormalities. Liver function test results by day of collection for these cases are presented in.

### Loss of life expectancy by 10 years or more from elevated aspartate aminotransferase: finding aspartate aminotransferase a better mortality predictor for all-cause and liver-related than alanine aminotransferase [^116iCHjp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 2 commonly ordered liver function tests, and ALT has long been considered more liver-specific than AST. Between the 2, the one which is better in predicting liver or non-liver-related mortality remains unsettled.

Methods

The cohort, 416,122 adults, came from a self-paying comprehensive health surveillance program during 1994–2008 and was followed up till 2008. Mortality came from National Death Index, with 10,412 deaths identified. Hazard ratios (HRs), computed by Cox model, and life expectancy, by life table method, were presented for 5 levels of AST and ALT with elevated AST or ALT defined as ≥ 40 IU/L. Liver disease included liver cancer and other liver conditions.

Results

There were 3 times more elevated ALT (15.4%) than AST (5.7%). However, those with elevated AST had higher mortality for all-cause (HR = 2.44), for liver disease (HR = 27.2), and for liver cancer (HR = 47.6) than its ALT counterparts (HR = 1.69, 10.8, and 20.2, respectively). Elevated AST also lost more years of life expectancy (10.2) than those lost by ALT (5.2) and larger than most common risks. Elevated AST had increased mortality from all cancers (HR = 3.57), stroke (HR = 1.36), respiratory diseases (HR = 1.34), and injuries (HR = 1.82), other than just liver disease. All-cause mortality remained significantly increased, when high risk groups were excluded, such as frequent drinkers, hepatitis carriers, those died from nonmedical conditions, those died in the first 3 years, or advanced fibrosis index based on 4 factors or aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index. Results were consistent between those returned for second visits and those analyzed in initial visits.

Discussion

Those with elevated AST (≥ 40 IU/L) had life expectancy cut short by 10.2 years, doubled the number of years lost with elevated ALT. For all-cause and for liver-related mortality, AST was an important predictor, better than ALT.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^111Kt9Ly]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical suspicion for steatotic liver disease in a child — primary care screening and referral: Children at risk are screened with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) starting at age 10 years, and this can be considered earlier if cardiometabolic risk factors, family history, or severe obesity are present. If there is clinical concern for acute liver disease, the pathway indicates "Yes, urgent referral"; otherwise, repeat ALT within 3 months and reassess annually if ongoing risks such as weight gain, severe obesity, prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Children with persistently elevated ALT levels or concerns for severe liver disease should be referred to pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology for further diagnostic evaluation.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: a nationwide cohort study [^117F6tYb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Liver injury or liver disease is usually asymptomatic until complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. Thus, liver function tests, including bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and aminotransferase levels are the mainstay for identifying early liver injury or liver disease. While alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be produced by organs other than the liver, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is exclusively produced in hepatocytes and widely used as a specific biomarker of liver injury or liver disease. As serum ALT measurement is relatively inexpensive, it is frequently used to screen for or exclude liver disease, and it is common to find asymptomatic individuals with abnormally elevated ALT levels. Subjects with elevated ALT levels are recommended to undergo additional workup to establish the etiology of liver injury. In these subjects, the most common causes of elevated ALT levels are alcohol-associated liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and NAFLD. When alcohol-associated liver disease or chronic viral hepatitis are identified as the causes of elevated ALT, current evidence and practice guidelines recommend complete abstinence. In subjects with other causes of elevated ALT levels (mostly subjects with NAFLD), it is controversial if they require complete abstinence and information regarding this issue is limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association of light to moderate alcohol intake on liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality among individuals with elevated ALT levels, but excluding those with excessive alcohol intake or viral hepatitis, using a nationwide population-based cohort.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

### Updated upper limit of normal for serum alanine aminotransferase value in Vietnamese population [^114zB6jE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Higher diastolic blood pressure was identified as an independent risk factor for higher ALT. Similar result was reported in two other Asian large-scale studies. Although the underlying cause remains unclear for this correlation, release of cardiovascular markers is related to increased ALT level in asymptomatic subjects. Therefore, various dyslipidaemias, which are also known risk factors for hypertension, might be associated with higher ALT. Further analysis that incorporates more confounding factors is required to clarify the association of high diastolic blood pressure with higher ALT level.

Interestingly, after excluding subjects with risk factors for higher ALT level, 3.3% (30 men, 11 women) of our healthy reference group still had a high ALT level of > 40 U/L for undefined causes. Possible explanations include alcohol consumption or drug-induced liver injury. Moreover, drinking habits may explain the large number of healthy men with higher ALT compared with healthy women.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113DLzap]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV/HBV coinfection — immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may manifest within the first 6 to 12 weeks after antiretroviral therapy (ART) is started when serum aminotransferase levels rise with CD4 recovery and acute hepatitis signs without another cause. After introduction of ART, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels should be monitored closely; some experts recommend ALT testing at 6 and 12 weeks, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Any association between abnormal aminotransferases and clinical jaundice or synthetic dysfunction (elevated international normalized ratio [INR] and low serum albumin) should prompt consultation with a hepatologist (CIII).

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^116PpXhr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

AASLD DILI — guidance on biomarkers and registries states that currently available serum markers of liver injury such as serum AST, ALT, and ALP levels are not sensitive or specific enough to detect early DILI, that DILI research continues to be hampered by the lack of an objective, reliable laboratory test to confirm a particular drug as the correct suspect agent, that DILI biomarkers in development are currently being directed toward improved DILI diagnosis and prognosis as well as to provide mechanistic insight into DILI pathogenesis, and that DILI registries worldwide should use standardized methods and protocols for clinical and biological sample collection and causality assessment to facilitate studies of DILI epidemiology, outcomes, and treatment.

### NASPGHAN clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children: recommendations from the Expert Committee on Nafld (ECON) and the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (NASPGHAN) [^114fbvh9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric NAFLD screening tests and follow-up — Currently, the best screening test for NAFLD in children is ALT, although it has substantial limitations (Strength: 1, Evidence: B). Interpretation of ALT should be based upon sex-specific upper limits of normal in children (22 U/L for girls and 26 U/L for boys) and not individual laboratory upper limits of normal (Strength: 1, Evidence: A). Persistently (> 3 months) elevated ALT more than twice the upper limit of normal should be evaluated for NAFLD or other causes of chronic hepatitis (Strength: 1, Evidence: C), and ALT of > 80 U/L warrants increased clinical concern and timely evaluation (Strength: 2, Evidence: C). Clinically available routine ultrasound is not recommended as a screening test for NAFLD in children due to inadequate sensitivity and specificity (Strength: 1, Evidence: B). Follow-up screening for NAFLD is recommended (Strength: 2, Evidence: C); when the initial screening test is normal, consider repeating ALT every 2 to 3 years if risk factors remain unchanged (Strength: 2, Evidence: C), and consider repeating screening sooner if clinical risk factors increase in number or severity (Strength: 2, Evidence: C).

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114g6ooU]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children — prevalence and risk factors — show variable estimates by method, with school-based alanine aminotransferase (ALT) screening using > 40 U/L reporting 23% of 17- to 18-year-olds with elevated unexplained ALT; an autopsy series of 742 children aged 2 to 19 years estimated NAFLD prevalence at 9.6%; and a meta-analysis reporting pooled mean prevalence of 7.6% in general-population children and 34.2% in pediatric obesity-clinic studies. In a primary care–referred screening cohort of 347 children with elevated ALT, NAFLD was diagnosed in 55%, other liver diseases in 18% with autoimmune hepatitis most common, and advanced fibrosis present in 11% of referred NAFLD cases; using ALT at 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) had sensitivity 57% and specificity 71%. Additional risk insights include that ALT alone may underestimate injury, obstructive sleep apnea severity was associated with histological NAFLD severity related to fibrosis stage, and family members of affected children showed higher correlations of abnormally high MRI-estimated fat fraction compared with matched controls.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and… [^111Fgk8i]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, defined as less than five times the upper limit of normal, are common in primary care. The prevalence of elevated transaminase levels is estimated to be approximately 10%, although less than 5% of these patients have a serious liver disease. Causes of Elevated Liver Transaminase Levels Hepatocellular damage releases ALT and AST. Elevations in ALT generally are more specific for liver injury, whereas elevations in AST can also be caused by extrahepatic disorders, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders. 7 Normal ALT levels are defined as 29 to 33 IU per L for males and 19 to 25 IU per L for females. 6 The AST: ALT ratio can suggest a specific disease or give insight into liver disease severity.

In a study differentiating alcoholic liver disease from nonalcoholic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease was suggested with an AST: ALT ratio greater than 2. COMMON HEPATIC CAUSES Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. A systematic review found that NAFLD is the most common cause of asymptomatic elevation of transaminase levels. 1, 10 NAFLD is divided into two subtypes. This index differentiates the conditions based on ALT level, AST level, height, mean corpuscular volume, sex, and weight. It has an LR+ of 12 and an LR– of 0. 07, and has been prospectively validated in several varied populations. 22–24. 36In the liver, an accumulation of an abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin protein results in progressive damage.

Although there are more than 100 alpha 1-antitrypsin gene variants, more than 95% of clinical disease is in ZZ homozygotes, also known as the PiZZ genotype.
