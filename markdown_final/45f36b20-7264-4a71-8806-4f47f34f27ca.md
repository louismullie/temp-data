## Question

A patient with hisotry of two ankle fractures when he was small now he is 22 years and he has been suffering from ankle pain for many years it come and goes every months now he have it when he walk for some steps no all the time and its cold now cold wheathrr and it goes when he rest what is his dd

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the possible causes (differential diagnosis) and appropriate evaluation for a 22-year-old with a history of childhood ankle fractures who now experiences intermittent, activity-related ankle pain that worsens in cold weather and improves with rest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the pain phenotype maps onto post-traumatic etiologies. Then, I should verify which entities are most likely given the history and exam features. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic strategy anchored to guidelines. Finally, I will prioritize the differential and propose initial management while I await imaging results, making sure I double-check for red flags and pitfalls along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pain phenotype and its implications. Intermittent, activity-related pain that flares in cold and abates with rest is highly compatible with post-traumatic osteoarthritis, chronic lateral ankle instability with co-pathologies, and impingement syndromes, all of which are well-described sequelae of prior ankle trauma and can be provoked by cold exposure and mechanical loading. I should also keep osteochondral lesions and peroneal tendon pathology on the list because they frequently accompany chronic instability and can be subtle on initial radiographs [^112zk4vz] [^1156eenV] [^113GiUih] [^113zMNjU] [^113eNJds].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the most likely diagnosis first. Post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a leading consideration here because prior intra-articular fractures are a major risk factor, and the pattern of pain with activity and relief with rest fits PTOA; I should confirm that the prior fractures were indeed intra-articular or involved the mortise, as that increases PTOA risk, and I should also remember that inadequate reduction increases risk, though I don't have operative details from childhood to verify that now [^112zk4vz].

> Next, I should review chronic lateral ankle instability as a co-primary. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and co-pathologies. Up to 40% of patients with lateral ankle sprains develop chronic instability, and among those with CAI, coexisting osteochondral lesions, impingement, synovitis, and peroneal tendon pathology are common; the intermittent nature and mechanical symptoms could reflect instability episodes superimposed on these lesions, so I need to screen for giving-way, recurrent sprains, and mechanical symptoms on history and exam [^116p5VaB] [^1156eenV].

> I will now examine osteochondral lesions of the talus as a high-yield secondary. Let me consider the classic clues: prior ankle injury, activity-related pain, catching or locking, and anterolateral or posteromedial talar tenderness. Radiographs can miss these lesions, so MRI is the standard for detection and staging, and delayed diagnosis risks progression and loose body formation, which would explain intermittent mechanical symptoms [^113zMNjU] [^111Ejkpf] [^11615QqM].

> But wait, what if impingement is the pain generator. Anterior or anterolateral impingement from bony spurs or soft-tissue hypertrophy can cause end-range pain and mechanical blockade, often after repetitive microtrauma or remote fractures. The cold-weather exacerbation could reflect synovitis and stiffness amplifying impingement mechanics, so I should ask about pain at terminal dorsiflexion and palpate for anterolateral tenderness [^113GiUih] [^113JHiDn].

> I need to ensure I don't overlook peroneal tendon pathology. Subluxation, tenosynovitis, or split tears can present with posterolateral pain, swelling, and instability. Dynamic ultrasound can demonstrate subluxation, while MRI better characterizes splits and tears. Given the lateral ankle's complex anatomy and propensity for missed co-pathology, I should palpate behind the fibula and test eversion strength carefully [^113eNJds] [^1114MaBh].

> Let me reconsider less likely but important differentials. Stress fractures of the medial malleolus or talar body can mimic arthritic pain and are often radiographically occult early. MRI is preferred if suspicion persists, though the absence of recent overuse or abrupt load change makes this less likely here. Posterior process or os trigonum pathology could explain posterior pain with plantarflexion, but I don't have clear posterior mechanical symptoms yet. Inflammatory arthropathy is less likely without morning stiffness or systemic features, but I should keep it in mind if the pattern evolves [^116VnsyD] [^113PQwZj] [^113wbzWB] [^114LAcNQ].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic strategy and make sure it aligns with guidelines. For chronic ankle pain of unclear etiology, start with weight-bearing ankle radiographs to assess joint space, osteophytes, malalignment, and loose bodies; if radiographs are unrevealing but suspicion remains for instability, osteochondral lesions, or soft-tissue pathology, proceed to MRI without contrast, which is usually appropriate in this scenario; ultrasound is reasonable if a tendon disorder is suspected and can be added dynamically [^115nSuLN] [^11132aeV] [^1114MaBh].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing syndesmotic or alignment issues. If exam suggests syndesmotic injury or there is concern for mortise instability, stress radiographs or CT can help evaluate the syndesmosis, but given the chronicity and lack of acute trauma, MRI is more likely to yield actionable information about cartilage, bone marrow, and soft tissues in this case [^117KJaMH] [^11132aeV].

> While awaiting imaging, I need to ensure conservative management is appropriate and safe. Activity modification, NSAIDs if no contraindications, and structured rehabilitation focused on proprioception, balance, and peroneal strengthening are first-line; bracing can reduce instability episodes and protect against reinjury; I should confirm there are no red flags such as fever, systemic symptoms, or neurologic deficits that would alter this pathway [^113Mon8s] [^114hv41K] [^114bfGBV].

> Let me synthesize the prioritized differential. Most likely: post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis with or without chronic lateral ankle instability. Next most likely: osteochondral lesion of the talus. Also high yield: anterior or anterolateral impingement and peroneal tendon pathology. Less likely but worth excluding based on imaging: stress fracture, posterior process/os trigonum syndrome, inflammatory arthritis. This ranking matches the pain phenotype, prior trauma, and known post-traumatic sequelae in young adults [^112zk4vz] [^113zMNjU] [^113GiUih] [^113eNJds].

> Finally, I should confirm the immediate next steps. Obtain weight-bearing ankle radiographs now. If unrevealing and symptoms persist or mechanical features are present, proceed to ankle MRI without contrast. In parallel, initiate NSAID therapy if appropriate, prescribe a lace-up or semi-rigid brace, and refer for physical therapy focused on neuromuscular training and peroneal strengthening. Reserve surgical consultation for refractory cases or if imaging reveals unstable osteochondral fragments, persistent syndesmotic instability, or significant impingement requiring debridement [^115nSuLN] [^11132aeV] [^113Mon8s] [^114bfGBV].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis** [^112zk4vz] due to prior fractures, with **chronic lateral ankle instability** as a key contributor [^113Q76UQ]. Other considerations include **osteochondral lesions of the talus** [^113zMNjU], **impingement syndromes** [^113GiUih], and **peroneal tendon pathology** [^113eNJds]. Start with **weight-bearing ankle radiographs** [^11132aeV]; if negative but suspicion remains, obtain MRI [^11132aeV] to assess cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Management is **conservative** [^116rVR4X] (NSAIDs, physical therapy, bracing) [^114hv41K]; consider surgery for refractory cases or instability [^114bfGBV].

## Differential diagnosis

Key distinguishing features of post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis and chronic lateral ankle instability:

| **Aspect** | **Post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis (ptoa)** | **Chronic lateral ankle instability (clai)** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | PTOA results from prior intra-articular fractures or ligamentous injuries, causing cartilage degeneration, joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral bone changes [^112zk4vz]. | Repeated ankle sprains or incomplete healing of lateral ligaments (ATFL, CFL) leads to mechanical and functional instability [^113Q76UQ]. |
| Clinical features | Intermittent pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion, often exacerbated by cold weather and relieved by rest [^notfound]. | Recurrent instability, frequent sprains, intermittent swelling, and pain with activity, often related to weather changes [^116RhW37]. |
| Imaging | Weight-bearing radiographs show joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and sclerosis; MRI can detect early cartilage changes and subchondral edema [^notfound]. | Stress radiographs or MRI can assess ligamentous laxity and associated lesions [^117KJaMH]. |

### Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT)

Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) are **cartilage and subchondral bone injuries** of the talar dome, often post-traumatic, that may present with chronic ankle pain, swelling, catching, or locking [^113zMNjU]. MRI is the **gold standard** for detecting and staging OLTs [^111Ejkpf].

---

### Impingement syndromes

Impingement syndromes result from mechanical impingement of bone or soft tissues at the ankle joint, often post-traumatic, and present with **pain at end-range motion**, swelling, and mechanical symptoms [^113GiUih]. MRI or CT can identify **impinging lesions** and associated soft-tissue pathology [^113JHiDn].

---

### Peroneal tendon pathology

Peroneal tendon pathology includes **tears, tenosynovitis, or instability** of the peroneal tendons, often related to repeated ankle sprains or chronic instability [^113eNJds]. Patients may report lateral ankle pain, swelling, instability, and pain with activity; MRI is the **preferred modality** for diagnosing peroneal tendon pathology [^1112LShQ].

---

### Other considerations

Other considerations include **stress fractures** — rare in this context but possible, particularly with repetitive loading or prior injury [^113PQwZj] — and **complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)** [^112oGDoh], a chronic pain syndrome with possible autonomic changes, though it is less likely given the intermittent nature of symptoms.

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a thorough **history** detailing prior fractures, sprains, activity level, pain characteristics, and weather-related symptoms, followed by a focused **physical examination** assessing tenderness, swelling, range of motion, stability tests (anterior drawer, talar tilt), and specific tests for impingement or peroneal tendon pathology [^114d8Gki].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Initial imaging**: Weight-bearing ankle radiographs (AP, lateral, mortise views) to assess joint space, osteophytes, and alignment [^1112LShQ].
- **Secondary imaging**: MRI if radiographs are inconclusive or if soft tissue, cartilage, or ligamentous pathology is suspected [^11132aeV].
- **Specialized imaging**: Stress radiographs or CT may be considered for specific indications (e.g. instability, impingement) [^117KJaMH].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management includes **NSAIDs** for pain and inflammation control [^1144XhEz]; structured physical therapy focused on strengthening, proprioception, and balance training [^113Mon8s]; and bracing or orthotic support to improve stability and reduce symptom recurrence [^1153HT5o]. Weight-bearing should be modified to avoid aggravating activities [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management is indicated for **refractory cases** in which conservative measures fail or for significant instability, large osteochondral lesions, or impingement [^114bfGBV]. Options include debridement, ligament reconstruction, osteochondral grafting, or arthroscopic procedures tailored to the underlying pathology [^113zMNjU].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by diagnosis and severity; **conservative management** is effective for many patients, though some may require surgical intervention for persistent symptoms or instability [^113zMNjU]. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate treatment and rehabilitation [^1153HT5o].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis** with chronic lateral ankle instability. A structured diagnostic approach — clinical evaluation and imaging — guides management, which is initially conservative, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of lateral ankle instability: a review of current literature [^115CnBBm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Lateral ankle sprains and instability are an increasingly identified pain point for patients, accounting for 20 to 25% of musculoskeletal injuries. Lateral ankle injuries are especially concerning given the propensity for patients to develop chronic lateral ankle instability and for the high risk of reinjury on an unstable ankle. With the complex articulation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, subtalar, and talocrural joints, pinpointing ankle dysfunction remains difficult. Multiple reviews have evaluated management and diagnosis of lateral ankle instability, but with newer treatment options available, a more comprehensive assessment of the current literature was conducted. Although multiple surgical options exist, many nonsurgical functional options have also been developed for patients that may help patients prevent the development of chronic lateral ankle instability. In recent times, many new options have come up, including in-office needle arthroscopy and continual advancements in diagnosis and our understanding of this difficult topic. Multiple reviews have evaluated the management and diagnosis of lateral ankle instability, but with newer treatment options available, a more comprehensive assessment of the current literature was conducted. Given this, this review will help to highlight new diagnostic and nonsurgical therapeutic options for the management of lateral ankle instability.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)

OCD is a lesion of bone and cartilage resulting in avascular bone necrosis and loss of continuity with subchondral bone. There may be partial or complete separation of articular cartilage with or without involvement of subchondral bone. Osteochondral lesions of the talus may cause chronic ankle pain. Adolescents often present with activity related pain, swelling and weakness. They may complain of catching, clicking or locking if a loose body is present. There is often history of remote macrotrauma (inversion ankle sprain) or repetitive microtrauma. On examination there may be an ankle effusion, limited range of motion, pain over the anterolateral or posteromedial talus and not over the lateral ligament complex. Radiographs may show a radiolucent lesion, subchondral fracture, potential separation with subchondral bone and a loose body. Talar OCD lesions are best seen on mortise view but can be missed on routine radiographs. MRI may show cartilage changes earlier. OCD lesions can be characterized by the radiographic appearance. The Berndt and Harty classification describes stage 1 lesions as a small area of compression, stage 2 as a separate fragment, stage III as a detached but hinged fragment and stage IV as detached fragments. Treatment depends on the stage of the lesion, with earlier stage lesions having the best prognosis. Treatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing; immobilization; cryotherapy; anti-inflammatories; drilling of subchondral bone to improve vascularity; and reattachment and/or removal of loose bodies.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^1112LShQ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

What are the key features to diagnose peroneal tendon pathology?

3.1 Initial assessment of a patient presenting with an acute ankle injury should follow the Ottawa ankle guidelines.
3.2 Based on imaging and physical examination, a specialist should be consulted for further examination. Both US and MRI are appropriate imaging modalities for the evaluation of peroneal tendons.
3.3 Peroneal tendoscopy should be reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion of peroneal tendon pathology based on history and clinical exam, but with the absence of any positive findings on imaging. See Fig. 1 for a schematic algorithm on diagnostic management of peroneal tendon pathology.

Rationale

Pathology of the peroneal tendons may present with a broad variety of symptoms. Acute dislocations typically present following an identifiable injury in a previously asymptomatic ankle. On investigation, there is posterolateral swelling and tenderness specifically over the SPR. Dislocation can frequently be reproduced on resisted eversion of the ankle.

Acute tears are likely to present with a sudden onset of pain and swelling, which also might be caused by the additional pathology such as a lateral ligament rupture often accompanying the acute pathology. Acute injuries present with bogginess and tenderness to palpation around the distal fibula. PB tears usually present with pain around the distal fibula, whereas PL tears typically present with pain near the peroneal tubercle and cuboid tunnel. Examination may also reveal respective weakness during ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion.

When assessing a patient presenting with an acute ankle injury, the panel agreed that initial assessment should follow the Ottawa ankle guidelines proposed by Steil et al, including anteroposterior and lateral weight-bearing radiographs of the affected ankle and, if foot pathology is suspected, an oblique view. Review by a specialist is reserved for cases where imaging reveals a "fleck sign" or fracture of the distal fibula, or in case of a clear history of a "popping" sensation or frank dislocation of the tendons(s). In addition, if the patient is unable to weight bear by one to two weeks postinjury, referral to the specialist is warranted. The panel agreed that specialist evaluation should also consider and evaluate for other causes for lateral ankle pain.

Both MRI and US are appropriate investigations and the choice is dependent on the clinician's preference, user expertise, and the availability of the imaging modality. Tendoscopy may be beneficial when there is a high clinical suspicion of peroneal tendon pathology in the absence positive findings on imaging.

### Fatigue stress fracture of the talar body: an uncommon cause of ankle pain [^116GZZZi]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Fatigue stress fractures of the talus are rare and usually involve the head of the talus in military recruits. We report an uncommon cause of ankle pain due to a fatigue stress fracture of the body of the talus in a 32-year-old male social soccer player. Healing was achieved after weightbearing suppression for 6 weeks. Although rare, a stress fracture of the body of the talus should be considered in an athlete with a gradual onset of chronic ankle pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan are useful tools for early diagnosis.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^116P484d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Achilles tendinopathy:

- **Definition**: Achilles tendinopathy is a non-rupture injury of the Achilles tendon characterized by pain, swelling, and reduced performance, with symptoms often exacerbated by physical activity.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy involves a continuum from reactive tendinopathy, where tenocytes proliferate and protein production increases, leading to tendon thickening, to tendon disrepair with further increase in tenocytes and protein production and focal collagen fiber disruption, and finally to degenerative tendinopathy involving cell death, large areas of collagen disorganization, and areas filled with vessels and nerves.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in the US is estimated at 235 per 100,000 person-years in the general population aged 21–60 years. Annually, 7–9% of runners experience Achilles tendinopathy.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy include a higher BMI, a history of tendinopathy or fracture, increased alcohol consumption, reduced plantar flexion strength, a high weekly volume of running, prolonged years of running, the use of spiked or shock-absorbing shoes, training in cold weather, and abnormal ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Other risk factors include male sex, the use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and fluoroquinolones.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with Achilles tendinopathy present with symptoms localized 2–7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion, painful Achilles tendon midportion on loading, local thickening of the Achilles tendon midportion, and pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy can vary widely among individuals, but generally, the condition is manageable with appropriate treatment.

### Stress fractures of the foot and ankle [^116VnsyD]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Stress fractures occur as a result of microscopic injuries sustained when bone is subjected to repeated submaximal stresses. Overtime, with repeated cycles of loading, accumulation of such injuries can lead to macro-structural failure and frank fracture. There are numerous stress fractures about the foot and ankle of which a trauma and orthopaedic surgeon should be aware. These include: metatarsal, tibia, calcaneus, navicular, fibula, talus, medial malleolus, sesamoid, cuneiform and cuboid. Awareness of these fractures is important as the diagnosis is frequently missed and appropriate treatment delayed. Late identification can be associated with protracted pain and disability, and may predispose to non-union and therefore necessitate operative intervention. This article outlines the epidemiology and risk factors, aetiology, presentation and management of the range of stress fractures in the foot and ankle.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults [^114zMTXH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The annual incidence of ankle fractures is 122 per 100,000 people. They usually affect young men and older women. The question of whether surgery or conservative treatment should be used for ankle fractures remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2012 Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Current Controlled Trials. Date of last search: 6 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical and conservative treatments for ankle fractures in adults were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Authors of the included studies were contacted to obtain original data.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised controlled trial were included. These involved a total of 292 participants with ankle fractures. All studies were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding. Additionally, loss to follow-up or inappropriate exclusion of participants put two trials at high risk of attrition bias. The trials used different and incompatible outcome measures for assessing function and pain. Only limited meta-analysis was possible for early treatment failure, some adverse events and radiological signs of arthritis. One trial, following up 92 of 111 randomised participants, found no statistically significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient-reported symptoms (self assessed ankle "troubles": 11/43 versus 14/49; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.76) or walking difficulties at seven years follow-up. One trial, reporting data for 31 of 43 randomised participants, found a statistically significantly better mean Olerud score in the surgically treated group but no difference between the two groups in pain scores after a mean follow-up of 27 months. A third trial, reporting data for 49 of 96 randomised participants at 3.5 years follow-up, reported no difference between the two groups in a non-validated clinical score. Early treatment failure, generally reflecting the failure of closed reduction (criteria not reported in two trials) probably or explicitly leading to surgery in patients allocated conservative treatment, was significantly higher in the conservative treatment group (2/116 versus 19/129; RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications. Pooled results from two trials of participants with radiological signs of osteoarthritis at averages of 3.5 and 7.0 years follow-up showed no between-group differences (44/66 versus 50/75; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude whether surgical or conservative treatment produces superior long-term outcomes for ankle fractures in adults. The identification of several ongoing randomised trials means that better evidence to inform this question is likely to be available in future.

### Ankle impingement syndromes [^113GiUih]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Impingement is a clinical syndrome of end-range joint pain or motion restriction caused by the direct mechanical abutment of bone or soft tissues. Impingement syndromes at the ankle may occur after acute macrotrauma or repetitive microtrauma. Modern imaging modalities can show underlying diseases and anatomic variations and assist with patient management. Implicit in the definition of impingement as a clinical syndrome is that the diagnosis remains clinical, because imaging changes alone do not reliably predict symptoms or clinical relevance. This article reviews the anatomy, pathogenesis, clinical features, differential diagnosis, imaging, and management of various impingement syndromes around the ankle.

### Osteochondral lesions of the talus [^113zMNjU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Osteochondral lesions of the talus occur infrequently and usually represent late sequelae of ankle trauma. Because of the functional significance of the talus and its limited capacity for repair, correct early diagnosis is important. Osteochondral fractures should be suspected in patients with chronic ankle pain, especially those with a prior ankle injury. Historically, plain radiographs have been used to stage lesions; more recently, magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy have been used. Non-surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment of acute, nondisplaced osteochondral lesions. Surgical management is reserved for unstable fragments or failure of nonsurgical treatment. Recent advances in osteochondral grafting have allowed reconstruction of the talar dome, leading to more predictable relief of pain and improvement of function.

### Persistent ankle pain following a sprain: a review of imaging [^112oGDoh]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The initial diagnosis of an "ankle sprain" is not always correct. Prolonged pain, swelling and disability sufficient to limit the activity and refractory to treatment following an ankle injury are not typical of an ankle sprain and should alert the clinician of the possibility of an alternative or an associated diagnosis. There are several conditions that can be misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain and those include ankle syndesmosis injuries, sinus tarsi syndrome, ankle and hind foot fractures, osteochondral lesions, posterior tibialis and peroneal tendons abnormalities, spring ligament damage, impingement syndromes and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. In this review, we discuss the imaging features of these conditions that can clinically mimic an ankle sprain. It is crucial to remember that unresolved ankle pain following an injury is not always just due to a "sprain".

Lateral ankle ligament sprains — chronic ankle instability (CAI) co-pathologies and referral — While the majority of patients recover after an acute ankle sprain, around 40% may continue to exhibit symptoms consistent with CAI. Coexisting pathology accompanying CAI may include fibularis muscle pathology, ankle impingement, osteochondral lesions, and synovitis. Clinicians should use diagnostic classifications other than ankle instability when the patient's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of this guideline, and clinicians should consider the presence of pathologies that may coexist or exist in isolation and refer to other appropriate professionals when symptoms and/or function do not fully recover after a LAS.

### Ankle stability and movement coordination impairments: lateral ankle ligament sprains revision 2021 [^11132aeV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Lateral ankle ligament sprain imaging — For suspected alignment abnormality suggesting syndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation, radiographs, an MRI scan without contrast, or a CT scan without contrast are usually appropriate; ultrasound imaging is usually not the first imaging study after an acute trauma to the ankle, but may be an appropriate secondary evaluation modality to assess for underlying soft tissue injuries, chondral avulsion fractures in children, or abnormalities with dynamic imaging stress testing. Exclusion criteria from these recommendations include children younger than 5 years of age or those with altered leg sensation (ie, diabetic), altered mental capacity, and/or inability to communicate. In those with symptoms that are present for more than 6 weeks, ankle radiographs are usually appropriate; if radiographs are negative but ankle instability, ankle impingement, osteochondral lesions, and/or tendon injuries are suspected, an MRI without contrast is usually appropriate. Ultrasound imaging may also be appropriate when a tendon injury is suspected, and contrast can be added to MRI when ankle instability is suspected.

### Pediatric lateral ankle avulsion fractures: age-specific patterns and diagnostic clues [^1135dqnq]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Lateral ankle injuries are common in pediatric populations. Avulsion fractures are a distinct injury involving bony disruption and may be underrecognized given their radiographically occult nature in skeletally immature patients. This study aims to compare the frequency, clinical presentation, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of lateral ankle avulsion fractures versus non-avulsion injuries in pediatric patients, with a focus on age-related differences.

Methods

Prospective cohort observational study conducted at a tertiary pediatric orthopedic/sports medicine practice. Patients aged 5 to 12 with a first lifetime lateral ankle injury within 30 days of the injury were consecutively enrolled, receiving clinical radiographs and research-based lateral ankle ultrasounds. Patients were classified into avulsion and non-avulsion groups based upon ultrasound findings, and additional comparisons were done between younger (age 5 to 10) and older (age 11 to 12) groups.

Results

Among 132 patients (mean age 9.95 (95% CI: 9.54–10.36), 56% younger group, 65% female), 44 avulsion fractures (33%) were identified. Avulsion fractures were significantly more common in the younger group (47%) than in the older group (16%) (P < 0.001). Swelling and bruising were more frequent in avulsion fractures (P < 0.001). Despite differences in injury type, initial presentation PROs did not differ.

Conclusions

Avulsion fractures account for one-third of pediatric lateral ankle injuries and are more frequent in younger children than older children, likely due to greater skeletal immaturity. Swelling and bruising may aid in accurate diagnosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if these fractures lead to subfibular ossicles, which are associated with chronic pain and instability.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old man with no significant medical history presents to the office for a complaint of right ankle pain, worsening gait and increasing difficulty ambulating for the last 14 months following a sports-related injury. He attributed his symptoms to an amateur wrestling match during which he felt a sudden pain in the lateral side of the right ankle after his body rolled over his ankle while the foot was in complete dorsiflexion and inversion. The pain was described as sharp, constant and non-radiating, localised to the lateral side of the right ankle, and was rated as an 'eight' on a scale of 1–10. The next morning, the site of injury was swollen, minimally improved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the patient required a cane for ambulating. The patient sought medical attention at a local outpatient clinic and had an X-ray of the right foot and ankle which demonstrated no fractures. The pain improved over the next few weeks with ice, mobility exercises and NSAIDs, but the patient noticed that his activities slowly decreased over the next 9 months. At first, the pain was only present during light outdoor jogs but over time had progressed to walking and only improved with rest. The quality of pain changed to a dull, 'gnawing' pain associated with reduction in range of motion in the ankle joint. The patient sought further medical therapy 7 months postinjury with intra-articular corticosteroids and weekly physical therapy, with minimal improvement. An MRI of the joint showed a 'cartilage defect with mild adjacent subchondral marrow edema in the far lateral aspect of the talar dome', as well as 'a small amount of tibiotalar joint fluid'. These findings were consistent with a 'talar-dome lesion' and signs of osteoarthritis. The patient was referred to a podiatrist for further recommendations based on the MRI findings.

Question

See page 1602 for the answer

A 22-year-old professional football player presented with fierce anterior ankle pain. He was unable to play and experienced pain during normal daily activities. No recent trauma to the ankle had occurred that could have elicited the pain. The pain started suddenly during training and then gradually worsened until he was completely unable to play and even started limping during daily activities. It took 2 weeks from the initial pain onset to the first clinical visit. No associated anomalies were present. Physical examination revealed no anomalies: a (pain)-free range of motion (ROM) as well as normal plantarand dorsiflexion and negative drawer test. Conventional radiography of the foot and ankle demonstrated no abnormalities (figure 1 A, B). A CT scan revealed minor radiolucent abnormalities of the talar body suspicious for a talar body stress fracture.

Figure 1
Antero-posterior and lateral conventional X-ray of the ankle, showing no abnormalities.

An MRI confirmed the suspected stress fracture of the talar body. A linear bond of low signal intensity was seen on sagittal T1-weighted images (figure 2). Coronal and axial images revealed a transtalar mediolateral lesion (figure 3 A, B). Based on the MRI, the fracture was classified as stable without displacement. Initially, the patient was treated conservatively in a short leg non weight bearing (NWB) cast for 4 weeks, followed by a walking cast for 4 weeks. Six weeks after the first MRI was taken — because of worsening pain during the conventional treatment period — a new MRI was performed.

### Posterior process fractures… [^113wbzWB]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Again, these fractures have been commonly misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. 2, 9, 15, 16 In one case series, 15 17 of 20 patients with fractures were misdiagnosed with ankle sprains. Posterior process fractures can occur at either or both tubercles. 14–18 Lateral and medial tubercle fractures are discussed separately. FRACTURES OF THE POSTERIOR PROCESS: LATERAL TUBERCLE Fractures of the lateral tubercle can be caused by hyperplantar flexion or inversion. 1, 2, 15 Hyperplantar flexion injuries tend to cause compression fractures, while inversion injuries tend to produce avulsion fractures. 1, 2, 15 Both of these injuries have been described after falls and have been associated with football and rugby kicking injuries, which place the ankle in a forced plantar flexed position. 19 If present, an os trigonum can be injured by the same mechanisms described above. 2, 19.

Diagnosis Clinically, patients with a fracture of the lateral tubercle present with pain and swelling in the posterolateral area of the ankle. The pain is often exacerbated by activities requiring plantar flexion. 15 Physical examination findings in lateral tubercle fractures of the posterior process are highly consistent for tenderness to deep palpation anterior to the Achilles tendon over the posterior talus. The pain is often reproduced with plantar flexion and occasionally accentuated with dorsiflexion of the great toe. This is caused by compression of the fracture fragment as the flexor hallucis longus tendon passes between the medial and lateral tubercle.
15. A lateral radiograph of the foot usually best visualizes the lateral tubercle and, if present, the os trigonum. 6, 9 When evaluating the fracture line, a rough, irregular cortical surface suggests the presence of an acute fracture.

In acute injuries, this rough irregular surface may help distinguish a fracture from a normal os trigonum, which generally has a smooth, rounded cortical surface. 15 In chronic cases, these differences may be less distinct, making the distinction between a fracture and a normal os trigonum difficult. When the diagnosis is unclear and clinical suspicion is present, an MRI or CT will clearly demonstrate this fracture.
16. Treatment Nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures can be treated with a non-weight-bearing, short leg cast for four to six weeks. 9, 15 After this period of immobilization, weight bearing is allowed as tolerated. If symptoms persist, an additional four to six weeks of immobilization would be recommended. 6 If the fracture site continues to be symptomatic after six months, fragment excision is usually curative. 6, 9 Larger and more displaced fractures may require open reduction internal fixation. 6, 16.

FRACTURES OF THE POSTERIOR PROCESS: MEDIAL TUBERCLE Diagnosis Visualization of the medial tubercle fracture on plain radiograph may be challenging, but the fracture can generally be seen on an oblique projection with the foot and ankle externally rotated 40 degrees and the beam centered 1 cm posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus 16,
17. However, CT or MRI may be necessary if the diagnosis is unclear. 16, 17 Treatment. 21, 22. Fractures of the anterior process account for approximately 15 percent of all calcaneal fractures and are commonly misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. 6, 21, 23, 24 Anterior process fractures secondary to compression generally occur when the foot is forcefully dorsiflexed and the anterior process is pressed against the cuboid. 22 Because of the energy involved with this mechanism, anterior process fractures secondary to compression are often intra-articular and are commonly associated with other fractures.

### Acute ankle sprain: an update [^113Mon8s]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Acute ankle injury, a common musculoskeletal injury, can cause ankle sprains. Some evidence suggests that previous injuries or limited joint flexibility may contribute to ankle sprains. The initial assessment of an acute ankle injury should include questions about the timing and mechanism of the injury. The Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules provide clinical guidelines for excluding a fracture in adults and children and determining if radiography is indicated at the time of injury. Reexamination three to five days after injury, when pain and swelling have improved, may help with the diagnosis. Therapy for ankle sprains focuses on controlling pain and swelling. PRICE (Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) is a well-established protocol for the treatment of ankle injury. There is some evidence that applying ice and using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs improves healing and speeds recovery. Functional rehabilitation (e.g., motion restoration and strengthening exercises) is preferred over immobilization. Superiority of surgical repair versus functional rehabilitation for severe lateral ligament rupture is controversial. Treatment using semirigid supports is superior to using elastic bandages. Support devices provide some protection against future ankle sprains, particularly in persons with a history of recurrent sprains. Ankle disk or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise regimens also may be helpful, although the literature supporting this is limited.

- patient's pain characteristics, including severity, type, spread, and quality

- previous and ongoing pain treatments and the perceived efficacy

- current inflammation and joint damage as sources of pain, and whether these are adequately treated

- pain-related factors that might need attention, including the nature and extent of pain-related disability, beliefs and emotions about pain and pain-related disability, social influences related to pain and its consequences, sleep problems, and obesity.

Medical history

A careful medical history should include the age of onset and accompanying symptoms, which may include bone pain, muscle weakness and pain, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, gait disturbance, height loss, increased thoracic kyphosis, pectus carinatum, and fractures. Cases have been reported in individuals as young as 9 months old, with a median age of onset of 46 years and a range of 9 months–90 years. Previous accounts indicated that equal proportions of men and women are affected by TIO; however, more recent evidence from systematic reviews suggests that more men than women are diagnosed. A systematic review of 895 TIO cases reported that, of the 858 cases with information on sex, 58.3% were male and 41.7% were female. Similar results were reported in another recent systematic review. Bone pain in the distal extremities is the most common initial symptom in adults, with ankles and feet being the most often affected. Other frequently reported sites of pain include the upper and lower back and neck, sternum, and shoulders, as well as diffuse/generalized bone pain. Fractures commonly occur in the ribs, vertebral bodies, femoral neck or shaft, and pelvis. In line with this, evidence also suggests that patients with TIO have notably lower bone mineral density and strength compared with not only healthy controls but also patients with X‐linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). In the rare cases in children, there may be delayed motor milestones, lower extremity deformity, failure to ambulate, and other rachitic symptoms (authors' clinical observations).

Medication history should be carefully assessed for iatrogenic causes of hypophosphatemia (Table 1).

Family history

TIO should be suspected in patients with suggestive symptoms and clinical presentation without evidence of personal or family history of hereditary hypophosphatemia. Taking an accurate family history is particularly important in children because genetic causes of hypophosphatemia are much more common than TIO. Ideally, all children and young adults suspected of having TIO should undergo genetic testing to exclude genetic causes of hypophosphatemia. Because the onset of heritable causes can sometimes be subtle, not becoming apparent until adulthood, genetic testing should be strongly considered in adults with chronic hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting for whom the diagnosis of TIO is being considered, especially when the tumor cannot be identified.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChronic ankle pain [^116BtoQ4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic ankle pain is a common clinical problem whose cause is often elucidated by imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria for chronic ankle pain define best practices of image ordering. Clinical scenarios are followed by the imaging choices and their appropriateness. The information is in ordered tables with an accompanying narrative explanation to guide physicians to order the right test. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^114HY85u]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

There is typically swelling, ecchymosis, and point tenderness to palpation at the fracture site. Bony deformity is often subtle or absent. A positive metatarsal loading test, which involves manual axial loading of the metatarsal, may exacerbate the pain and help differentiate a fracture from a soft tissue injury.
3. MANAGEMENT Nondisplaced acute metatarsal shaft fractures generally heal well without complications. Minimally displaced fractures of the second to fifth metatarsal shafts. and fractures with less than 10° of dorsoplantar angulation in the absence of other injuries can generally be managed in the same manner as nondisplaced fractures. 2–4, 6 Initial management includes immobilization in a posterior splint, use of crutches, and avoidance of weight-bearing activities. Patients should be instructed to apply ice, elevate the foot above heart level, and use analgesics as needed.

Follow-up should occur within three to five days to allow for reduction of soft tissue swelling. At the first follow-up visit, radiography should be performed to assure fracture stability. If stable, the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking cast or boot. 3, 6. The choice of immobilization device depends on the patient's ability to ambulate with the device with minimal to no pain. There is evidence that transitioning to a walking boot and then to a rigid-sole shoe at four to six weeks, with progressive weight bearing as tolerated, results in improved functional outcomes compared with cast immobilization, with no differences in healing time or pain scores.
12. HISTORY Patients with a proximal fifth metatarsal fracture often present after an acute inversion of the foot or ankle. Patients have localized pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on the lateral aspect of the foot.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination should consist of a neurovascular evaluation and palpation of the foot and ankle. There is typically focal tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis at the base of the fifth metatarsal. Patients usually cannot bear full weight and sometimes will ambulate only on the medial aspect of the foot. MANAGEMENT: TUBEROSITY AVULSION FRACTURES Minimally displaced avulsion fractures typically require immobilization and support with a short leg walking boot. Evidence has shown that, depending on symptoms, short leg walking boots are superior to short leg walking casts. 18, 19 Immobilization in a cast or boot is typically only needed for two weeks, with progressive ambulation and range of motion thereafter as tolerated. Follow-up visits should be scheduled every two weeks, and healing time varies from four to eight weeks.

3, 6 Follow-up radiography is typically required only at six to eight weeks to document healing, or earlier if the patient has persistent localized pain or continued painful ambulation at four weeks. 2, 3, 6. MANAGEMENT: JONES FRACTURES Initial management of a Jones fracture includes a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activity, with follow-up in three to five days. After that, nonsurgical treatment options include six to eight weeks of short leg non–weight-bearing cast with radiographic follow-up to document healing at six to eight weeks. 2, 6, 20 If evidence of healing is present at that time, weight-bearing activity can progress gradually, along with physical therapy and rehabilitation. If no healing has occurred at six to eight weeks, avoidance of weight-bearing activity should continue for another four weeks. 2, 6, 20 Typical length of immobilization is six to 10 weeks, and healing time is typically up to 12 weeks.

### Can paediatric emergency clinicians identify and manage clavicle fractures without radiographs in the emergency department? A prospective study [^114npT6Z]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

It is probable that patients and their families prefer or expect radiographs in the management of a suspected clavicle fracture. However, studies suggest the opposite, including those in both paediatric and adult populations. The multicentre trial evaluating the use of the 'Low Risk Ankle Rule' demonstrated that this validated clinical decision rule has reduced ankle radiography significantly and safely without change in patient or clinician satisfaction. Similarly, the 'Ottawa Ankle Rule' did not cause a decrease in patient satisfaction, despite a reduction in X-rays.

Our data indicate that clinicians are guided by their clinical examination rather than the radiographic findings. While omitting radiographs could potentially lead to 'over-treatment', placing a child's arm in BAS for short periods poses little harm to the child and provides relief from pain in patients who have not sustained a fracture in any case. Indeed, at our institution, we have reduced the use of radiographs for traumatic clavicle injury by 86% in the 4 years after this study was conducted, with no evidence of mismanagement or complication (995 radiographs performed between February 2008 and August 2012 compared with 136 performed between November 2012 and November 2016).

It is likely that radiographs are required for very young patients, in open fractures, in cases of non-accidental injury, in those with neurovascular compromise or those that cannot be adequately clinically assessed. We suggest further clinical studies to ultimately develop clinical decision tool to help emergency clinicians in deciding when to order X-rays.

### Ankle fracture… [^116iPWCu]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

An ankle fracture is a break of one or more of the bones that make up the ankle joint. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, bruising, and an inability to walk on the injured leg. Complications may include an associated high ankle sprain, compartment syndrome, stiffness, malunion, and post-traumatic arthritis. Ankle fractures may result from excessive stress on the joint such as from rolling an ankle or from blunt trauma. Types of ankle fractures include lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, posterior malleolus, bimalleolar, and trimalleolar fractures. The Ottawa ankle rule can help determine the need for X-rays. Special X-ray views called stress views help determine whether an ankle fracture is unstable. Treatment depends on the fracture type. Ankle stability largely dictates non-operative vs. operative treatment.

Non-operative treatment includes splinting or casting while operative treatment includes fixing the fracture with metal implants through an open reduction internal fixation. Significant recovery generally occurs within four months while completely recovery usually takes up to one year. This articulation is primarily responsible for plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. Together the tibia and fibula form a bracket-shaped socket known as the mortise, into which the dome-shaped talus fits. The talus and the fibula are connected by a strong group of ligaments, which provide support for the lateral aspect of the ankle. It prevents the foot from excessively everting, or turning outwards while also preventing the talus from externally rotating. The distal parts of the tibia and fibula are connected by a connective tissue network referred to as the syndesmosis, which consists of four ligaments and the interosseous membrane.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms of an ankle fracture can be similar to those of ankle sprains, though typically they are often more severe by comparison. It is exceedingly rare for the ankle joint to dislocate in the presence of ligamentous injury alone. However, in the setting of an ankle fracture, the talus can become unstable and subluxate or dislocate. Patients may notice ecchymosis, or there may be an abnormal position, alignment, gross instability, or lack of normal motion secondary to pain. In a displaced fracture the skin is sometimes tented over a sharp edge of broken bone. The sharp fragments of broken bone sometimes tear the skin and form a laceration that communicates with the broken bone or joint space. This is known as an open fracture and has a high incidence of infection if not promptly treated.

Diagnosis Physical Examination Patients with ankle fractures may have variable findings on physical examination. Generally, the injured side should be compared to the non-injured side. The skin should be carefully examined, paying particular attention to any openings or breaks in the skin that could be due to an open fracture. It is important to evaluate the exact location of the pain, the range of motion of the ankle, and the condition of the nerves and blood vessels. It is also important to palpate the calf proximally because there may be an associated high fibula fracture. Findings On X-rays, there can be a fracture of the medial malleolus, the lateral malleolus, and/or of the anterior/posterior margin of the distal tibia. The posterior margin is much more frequently injured than the anterior aspect of the distal tibia.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^114d8Gki]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Foot and ankle problems are common in the pediatric population. Problems can be related to skeletal maturity and are fairly specific to the age of the child. An awareness of congenital anomalies, developmental variation, skeletal maturation and lower extremity alignment will aid the physician in evaluation and management. This article will review common causes of foot and ankle pain in the pediatric population. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not review acute traumatic fractures.

Clinical history

Most foot and ankle pain in the active pediatric population are associated with minor trauma or repetitive stress combined with abnormal biomechanics of the foot and lower extremity. Older children may isolate pain to a specific site whereas toddlers are more likely limp or refuse to bear weight. Often there is no clear history of traumatic event. There are numerous, non-traumatic diseases that masquerade as injuries.

The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest, aggravating and alleviating factors, night pain); trauma (acute macrotrauma, repetitive microtrauma, recent/remote); mechanical symptoms (locking, catching, clicking, instability, worse during or after activity); inflammatory symptoms (morning stiffness, swelling); neurological symptoms (weakness, altered sensation); gait (limp, altered weight bearing); effects of previous treatments and the current level of function of the child. Location of pain is the most important historical factor in aiding diagnosis.

A history of previous injury and/or surgery, neurological disorder, chronic inflammatory joint disease or bleeding diathesis is significant. Family history of orthopedic, neurologic or rheumatic disease is also important.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures [^115H93Uy]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ankle fracture:

- Definition: Ankle fractures refer to a fracture in any of the three bones comprising the ankle joint: the lateral or posterior malleolus of the tibia, medial malleolus of the fibula, and/or the talus.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of ankle fractures include trauma from falls, sports injuries, and twisting of the ankle. The primary mechanisms of ankle fractures are rotational injuries and supination or pronation movements.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ankle fractures include advanced age, higher BMI, and participation in high-impact sports. Motor vehicle crashes can also lead to ankle fractures, particularly in drivers due to pedal interaction.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with ankle fractures often present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the ankle area. They may also have difficulty bearing weight on the affected side.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of ankle fractures can vary based on the severity of the fracture and the patient's adherence to rehabilitation. Complications such as posttraumatic arthritis or chronic instability can occur. In some cases, surgical intervention may be required, particularly for complex fractures.

### Sprained ankle… [^117TSgkw]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Along with this inflammation, swelling and pain is experienced. The nerves in the area become more sensitive when the injury is suffered, so pain is felt as throbbing and will worsen if there is pressure placed on the area. Warmth and redness are also seen as blood flow is increased. There is also decreased ability to move the joint.
- Right foot, housed in an air brace, has become swollen as a result of a more severe 2nd degree sprain to the ankle.
- Right foot, 3rd degree sprain. One day after injury.
- Inadequate joint proprioception;
- Slow neuron muscular response to an off-balance position;
- Running or stepping on uneven surfaces;
- Shoes with inadequate heel support; and
- Wearing high-heeled shoes – due to the weak position of the ankle joint with an elevated heel, and a small base of support.

Diagnosis The diagnosis of a sprain relies on the medical history, including symptoms, as well as making a differential diagnosis, mainly in distinguishing it from strains or bone fractures. The Ottawa ankle rule is a simple, widely used rule to help differentiate fractures of the ankle or mid-foot from other ankle injuries that do not require x-ray radiography. It has a sensitivity of nearly 100%, meaning that a patient who tests negative, according to the rule almost certainly does not have an ankle fracture. If ankle pain is persistent 6–8 weeks after initial sprain, MRI imaging of the joint can be considered to rule out peroneal tendon, osteochondral, or syndesmotic injury. Treatment Initial treatment commonly consists of rest, icing, compression and elevation.

These elements have been recommended by physicians for decades for the treatment of soft tissue damage, and sprained ankles, one of the most common soft tissue injuries. For most ankle sprains, functional treatment is generally preferred over immobilization. Studies have shown patients return back to normal activities sooner when management is focused on restoring ankle function
- typically by using braces, taping or elastic bandages, rather than complete immobilization such as a plaster casting. Functional treatment generally consists of three phases: the first is the RICE regime in the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce swelling and pain. The second phase is range of motion and ankle strengthening exercises within 48 to 72 hours. Finally the third phase involves progressive endurance and balance training during recovery. The beginning of progressive exercise therapy must be made in the first week.

RICE alone is no longer considered sufficient for full recovery from an ankle sprain. Balance and Neuromuscular Training; Programs such as wobble board training, hopping exercises and single-leg balance with the help of balance reduce the recurrence rates of up to 40 and 50 percent. Conservative measures Ice is often used to reduce swelling in cycles of 15–20 minutes on and 20–30 minutes off. Icing an ankle too long can cause cold injuries, which is indicated by the area turning white. Also, it is often recommended that ice not be applied directly to the skin, but should have a thin buffer between the ice and the affected area, and some professionals think ice need not be applied at all. Recently, Gabe Mirkin, MD, who coined and popularized the acronym RICE in his The Sportsmedicine Book in 1978, no longer recommends "complete" rest or ice for healing a sprain.

### 2016 consensus statement of the international ankle consortium: prevalence, impact and long-term consequences of lateral ankle sprains [^111p1iLz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The Executive Committee of the International Ankle Consortium presents this 2016 position paper with recommendations for information implementation and continued research based on the paradigm that lateral ankle sprain (LAS), and the development of chronic ankle instability (CAI), serve as a conduit to a significant global healthcare burden. We intend our recommendations to serve as a mechanism to promote efforts to improve prevention and early management of LAS. We believe this will reduce the prevalence of CAI and associated sequelae that have led to the broader public health burdens of decreased physical activity and early onset ankle joint post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Ultimately, this can contribute to healthier lifestyles and promotion of physical activity.

### Stress fracture of the pelvis and lower limbs including atypical femoral fractures-a review [^113yRxLr]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The high cost and limited availability of MRI has led to the development of guidelines to support clinical decision making. The US military has proposed to primarily use radiography, at the earliest 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. If negative, the radiographs are repeated a further week later. If still negative an MRI is performed. The recommendation for US American family physicians also envisages the initial use of radiographs for suspected stress fractures. If negative, ideally MRI should be performed; if this is not feasible bone scintigraphy is advised.

The initial use of radiographs has the further advantage of being able to assess for other significant pathologies such as tumours, degenerative or inflammatory changes, malalignment or frank trauma, etc.

In the authors' practice ultrasound is not routinely performed for the assessment of stress fractures although it is important to be aware of the imaging findings. The authors have encountered a number of patients referred for ultrasound examination with non-specific foot or ankle pain who were found to suffer from stress fractures.

### Ankle arthritis-an important signpost in rheumatologic practice [^114LAcNQ]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent major advances in management of rheumatic diseases, clinical diagnosis can remain challenging. Pattern recognition is an important part of this process, encompassing all aspects of the patient, history, examination and results of investigations. Assessment of the individual joints affected is particularly important in formulating a differential diagnosis, with, for example, characteristic involvement of the DIP and first carpo-metacarpal joints in OA, whereas these joints are generally spared in RA.

This review article focuses on the ankle joint across the spectrum of rheumatic conditions, where it is differentially affected in certain arthritides and spared in others. In this regard, the ankle is an interesting and perhaps neglected signpost in the process of differential diagnosis. We also draw attention to peri-articular mimics of ankle arthritis, as the hind foot is a complex region requiring careful clinical examination to assess the cause of pain and swelling.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

### A template approach for detecting fractures in adults sustaining low-energy ankle trauma [^112aa1dj]. Emergency Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Low-energy trauma such as sprains account for 75% of injuries to the ankle; therefore, ankle pain is one of the most common problems encountered by emergency physicians. A close inspection of the radiographs is often required for diagnosis and this depends on the knowledge of high-risk areas since proper treatment relies on the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. In this article, we will present a template that has helped to increase the accuracy for detecting subtle avulsion fractures, chip fractures, and osteochondral fractures of the hind foot in adults sustaining low-energy ankle injuries. By utilizing this search strategy and understanding where the potential sites for fractures exist, the detection of these subtle fractures can be maximized.

### Ankle… [^114mRZ1e]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Structure Region The ankle region is found at the junction of the leg and the foot. It extends downwards from the narrowest point of the lower leg and includes the parts of the foot closer to the body to the heel and upper surface of the foot. The medial malleolus is a bony process extending distally off the medial tibia. The distal-most aspect of the fibula is called the lateral malleolus. Together, the malleoli, along with their supporting ligaments, stabilize the talus underneath the tibia. The distances between the bones in the ankle are as follows:

- Talus
- **Medial malleolus**:

1. 70 ±
0. 13 mm
- Talus
- **Tibial plafond**:

2. 04 ±
0. 29 mm
- Talus
- **Lateral malleolus**:

2. 13 ±
0. 20 mm Decreased distances indicate osteoarthritis. Though it does not span the ankle joint itself, the syndesmotic ligament makes an important contribution to the stability of the ankle. This ligament spans the syndesmosis, i.e.

the articulation between the medial aspect of the distal fibula and the lateral aspect of the distal tibia. An isolated injury to this ligament is often called a high ankle sprain. The bony architecture of the ankle joint is most stable in dorsiflexion. Thus, a sprained ankle is more likely to occur when the ankle is plantar-flexed, as ligamentous support is more important in this position. The classic ankle sprain involves the anterior talofibular ligament, which is also the most commonly injured ligament during inversion sprains. Another ligament that can be injured in a severe ankle sprain is the calcaneofibular ligament. Retinacula, tendons and their synovial sheaths, vessels, and nerves A number of tendons pass through the ankle region. Bands of connective tissue called retinacula allow the tendons to exert force across the angle between the leg and foot without lifting away from the angle, a process called bowstringing.

The superior extensor retinaculum of foot extends between the anterior surfaces of the tibia and fibula near their lower ends. The inferior extensor retinaculum of foot is a Y-shaped structure. Its lateral attachment is on the calcaneus, and the band travels towards the anterior tibia where it is attached and blends with the superior extensor retinaculum. Along with that course, the band divides and another segment attaches to the plantar aponeurosis. The tendons which pass through the superior extensor retinaculum are all sheathed along their paths through the inferior extensor retinaculum and the tendon of the fibularis tertius muscle is also contained within the retinaculum.

The flexor retinaculum of foot extends from the medial malleolus to the medical process of the calcaneus, and the following structures in order from medial to lateral: the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle, the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle, the posterior tibial artery and vein, the tibial nerve, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. Clinical significance Traumatic injury Of all major joints, the ankle is the most commonly injured. If the outside surface of the foot is twisted under the leg during weight bearing, the lateral ligament, especially the anterior talofibular portion, is subject to tearing as it is weaker than the medial ligament and it resists inward rotation of the talocrural joint. Fractures An ankle fracture is a break of one or more of the bones that make up the ankle joint. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, bruising, and an inability to walk on the injured leg.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of lateral ankle instability: a review of current literature [^116p5VaB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute ankle injuries continue to be a common issue treated by orthopaedic surgeons and sports medicine physicians with many diagnostic and treatment options. Among ankle injuries, those to the lateral ankle are more prevalent and compose the cohort of patients who experience acute lateral ankle instability (ALAI). Of those who experience acute injuries of the lateral ankle, many are amenable to conservative approaches (rehabilitative and minimally invasive therapies), but a subgroup of up to 40% continue to develop into chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI), highlighting the importance of optimizing interventions to help decrease this cohort. In addition, many of these patients with ALAI or CLAI are predisposed to future injuries, making it important for physicians to ensure patients not only recover but also bolster their lateral ankle complex to help prevent future recurrence. This article will review the lateral ankle complex, diagnosis, minimally invasive treatments, and preventive options for patients with lateral ankle instability.

### Ankle stability and movement coordination impairments: ankle ligament sprains [^11557zrV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Ankle instability after lateral ankle injury — When symptoms persist, ankle instability is commonly diagnosed and reported rates vary widely. When symptoms of instability continue after a lateral ankle injury, patients are commonly diagnosed as having ankle instability. Symptoms reported to be associated with ankle instability vary greatly in the literature, with recurrent sprains reported to occur in as high as 73% of athletes. However, in high-quality studies, continued reports of instability were noted in 0% to 33% of patients in follow-up periods of 3 years or less. Individuals with long-term symptoms and signs after acute lateral ankle injuries are commonly characterized as either having mechanical or functional ankle instability.

### Peroneal tendon injuries [^113eNJds]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Peroneal tendon injuries are underdiagnosed and should be considered in every patient who presents with chronic lateral ankle pain. Ankle sprains are common, and up to 40% of affected individuals experience subsequent chronic ankle pain. Identifying the source of chronic ankle pain can be difficult because of the large number of possible causes. The peroneal tendons are the primary evertors of the foot and function as lateral ankle stabilizers. A careful physical examination, along with a thorough patient history and imaging studies, are critical in arriving at an accurate diagnosis. Understanding the anatomy of the peroneal tendons and knowledge of current treatment approaches for peroneal tendon tears, subluxation and dislocation of the tendons, and peroneal tenosynovitis are of great importance in achieving a favorable outcome. Low-demand patients do well with a nonsurgical approach; high-demand patients may benefit from surgery.

### Insufficiency fractures of the calcaneus: a diagnostic pitfall for ankle arthritis [^1155dHU2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To highlight the differential diagnosis between insufficiency fractures (IF) of the calcaneus and arthritis of the ankle.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed clinical charts and imaging findings for 6 patients with 7 IF of the calcaneus who were referred with the diagnosis of ankle arthritis. The main predisposing factors, clinical features, therapy, and outcome were recorded. IF was considered when occurring spontaneously or with minimal trauma.

Results

All patients were women, with a mean age of 73.8 ± 6.3 years. The median delay to diagnosis was 6 weeks (25th, 75th percentiles: 1, 12). Two had previous IF at other locations. Three patients had a history of chronic inflammatory conditions while receiving longterm steroid therapy. All complained of moderate to severe pain that interfered with daily activities and was relieved with rest. Physical examination revealed ankle inflammation in all cases. Radiographs were normal in 5 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was diagnostic. All received conservative treatment with complete resolution of symptoms without sequelae.

Conclusion

IF of the calcaneus are relatively rare but can be mistaken for ankle arthritis. MRI is recommended because this type of fracture is difficult to detect on plain films. Although IF have a good prognosis with conservative treatment, increased awareness is of importance for prompt diagnosis and proper management.

### Impingement syndromes of the ankle and hindfoot [^113JHiDn]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ankle impingement refers to a chronic painful mechanical limitation of ankle motion caused by soft-tissue or osseous abnormality affecting the tibiotalar joint or extraarticular soft tissues. Impingement can be associated with a prior single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma, often in an adolescent with anatomical predisposition. Impingement syndromes at the tibiotalar joint can be subdivided into anterior, anterolateral, anteromedial, posterior or posteromedial. Extraarticular impingement can consist of talocalcaneal or subfibular impingement. Impingement syndromes are just one possible etiology of persistent ankle pain, and although the diagnosis is often made or suspected clinically, the radiologist might be the first person to raise the possibility of the diagnosis or be called upon to provide support for the clinically suspected diagnosis. In this article I review the etiology, imaging findings and current treatment associated with these conditions.

The case is presented of a 27 year old woman with lateral ankle pain after an inversion injury sustained while dancing. Although initial radiographs failed to identify the fracture, radiographs of the ankle at six weeks showed an unsuspected fracture of the lateral process of the talus. The fracture was treated with cast immobilisation for six weeks and the patient is currently undergoing aggressive physiotherapy. A literature review revealed that fractures of the lateral process of the talus are frequently overlooked and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute and chronic ankle pain as an early diagnosis and treatment prevent long term complications.

### Foot and ankle stress fractures in athletes [^113PQwZj]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of stress fractures in the general athletic population is less than 1%, but may be as high as 15% in runners. Stress fractures of the foot and ankle account for almost half of bone stress injuries in athletes. These injuries occur because of repetitive submaximal stresses on the bone resulting in microfractures, which may coalesce to form complete fractures. Advanced imaging such as MRI and triple-phase bone scans is used to evaluate patients with suspected stress fracture. Low-risk stress fractures are typically treated with rest and protected weight bearing. High-stress fractures more often require surgical treatment.

Clinical course after lateral ankle sprain (LAS) — 2013 condensed summary without recommendation: following a LAS, there is a rapid decrease in pain and improvement in function in the first 2 weeks after injury; however, 5% to 33% of patients continue to experience pain 1 year or more after the LAS, with 5% to 25% still experiencing pain after 3 years. Fifty percent to 85% of individuals with a LAS report full recovery at approximately 3 years after the injury, independent of sprain severity, and when symptoms of instability continue beyond 1 year after a LAS, patients are commonly diagnosed as having chronic ankle instability (CAI). In high-quality studies, continued reports of instability were noted in 0% to 33% of patients in follow-up periods of 3 years or less, and prognosis may also be related to not receiving appropriate treatment after injury, including bracing and rehabilitation, with a higher risk of ankle instability and reinjury in high- compared to low-activity groups.

### Evidence review for the 2016 international ankle consortium consensus statement on the prevalence, impact and long-term consequences of lateral ankle sprains [^113Q76UQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are the most prevalent musculoskeletal injury in physically active populations. They also have a high prevalence in the general population and pose a substantial healthcare burden. The recurrence rates of LASs are high, leading to a large percentage of patients with LAS developing chronic ankle instability. This chronicity is associated with decreased physical activity levels and quality of life and associates with increasing rates of post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis, all of which generate financial costs that are larger than many have realised. The literature review that follows expands this paradigm and introduces emerging areas that should be prioritised for continued research, supporting a companion position statement paper that proposes recommendations for using this summary of information, and needs for specific future research.

Achilles tendon rupture is the breakage of the Achilles tendon at the back of the ankle. Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult. Rupture of the Achilles tendon usually occurs due to a sudden, forceful push-off movement, an abrupt dorsiflexion of the foot while the calf muscle is engaged, or direct trauma. Chronic degeneration of the tendon, often from tendinosis, also increases the likelihood of rupture. Common risk factors include fluoroquinolone or corticosteroid use, sudden increases in physical activity, inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and chronic overuse or improper training. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical symptoms and physical examination, with imaging such as ultrasound or MRI used for confirmation when needed. Prevention may include stretching before activity and gradual progression of exercise intensity.

Treatment may consist of surgical repair or conservative management. Quick return to weight bearing appears acceptable and is often recommended. While surgery traditionally results in a small decrease in the risk of re-rupture, the risk of other complications is greater. Non-surgical treatment is an alternative as there is supporting evidence that rerupture rates and satisfactory outcomes are comparable to surgery. If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes are not as good. Signs and symptoms The main symptom of an Achilles tendon rupture is the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. Additionally, a snap or "pop" may be heard as the tendon breaks. Some people describe the pain as a hit or kick behind the lower leg. There is difficulty walking immediately. It may be difficult to push off or stand on the toes of the injured leg. Swelling may be present around the heel.

Causes The Achilles tendon is most often injured by sudden downward or upward movement of the foot, or by forced upward flexion of the foot outside its normal range of motion. Other ways the Achilles tendon can be torn involve sudden direct trauma or damage to the tendon, or sudden use of the Achilles after prolonged periods of inactivity, such as bed rest or leg injury. Many people may develop an Achilles rupture or tear, such as recreational athletes, older people, or those with a previous Achilles tendon injury. Tendon injections, quinolone use, and extreme changes in exercise intensity can contribute. Most cases of Achilles tendon rupture are traumatic sports injuries. The average age of patients is 29–40 years with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:

1. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on symptoms and history of the event. People describe it like being kicked or shot behind the ankle. During physical examination, a gap may be felt above the heel unless swelling is present.

A common physical exam test the doctor or provider may perform is the Simmonds' test. To perform the test, have the person lay on their stomach, face down, and with their feet hanging from the exam table. The test is positive if squeezing the calf muscles of the affected side results in no movement of the foot. The test is negative with an intact Achilles tendon and squeezing the calf muscle results in the foot flexing down. Walking is usually impaired, as the person will be unable to step off the ground using the injured leg. The person will also be unable to stand up on the toes of that leg, and pointing the foot downward is impaired. Pain may be severe, and swelling around the ankle is common. In percutaneous surgery, several small incisions are made, rather than one large incision. The tendon is sewn back together through the incision.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^116UvF9f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, there are numerous causes of joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Many can be attributed to minor activity or overuse-related injury, especially in the overweight and obese populations, but in the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, other diagnoses must be considered. These typically fall into two categories in children and adolescents: bony or structural causes, or rheumatologic conditions. Careful history and physical examination, along with use of imaging and laboratory studies, can often distinguish between the two; however, when a complete work-up is performed and no clear answer emerges, the differential must be expanded. In the rare case in which a firm primary diagnosis has been made, it is more difficult still to consider additional, secondary, causes of joint pain.

The following case describes an adolescent young man with severe ankle pain, as well as multiple other joint complaints, who was correctly diagnosed and treated for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While the majority of his joints improved, his ankle continued to be extremely tender and swollen. After two years of aggressive medical treatment, surgical procedures, and multiple imaging studies, it was careful probing into his history and classic physical examination findings that ultimately led to the additional diagnosis of gout.

### Split peroneus brevis tendon: an unusual cause of ankle pain and instability [^111Bh1cP]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tears of the peroneus brevis tendon may cause ankle pain, swelling, and instability. Supportive therapy with ankle bracing and analgesics is the mainstay of therapy, but surgical repair is often required in patients with ongoing symptoms. Surgical options include debridement, tubularization, or, in severe cases, resection of the damaged tendon and tenodesis. We describe a 64-year-old woman with a split peroneus brevis tendon presenting with lateral ankle pain, swelling, and instability, and we review the literature regarding presentation, diagnostic testing, pathophysiology, predisposing factors, and treatment recommendations. Primary care physicians should consider peroneal tendon injuries in patients with chronic lateral ankle pain and instability.

### Osteochondral lesions about the ankle [^111Ejkpf]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Osteochondral lesions (OCLs) about the foot and ankle often manifest clinically as prolonged joint pain after trauma, often an ankle sprain, which is refractory to conventional, conservative therapeutic treatment. Noncontrast MR imaging is the standard of care imaging modality for diagnosing and classifying osteochondral lesions, but equivocal or difficult lesions can be assessed more specifically with direct MR arthrography or in conjunction with multidetector CT. Once an OCL has been identified, the imager should make every effort to determine whether it is stable or potentially unstable.

### Update on acute ankle sprains [^114hv41K]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Ankle sprains are a common problem seen by primary care physicians, especially among teenagers and young adults. Most ankle sprains are inversion injuries to the lateral ankle ligaments, although high sprains representing damage to the tibiofibular syndesmosis are becoming increasingly recognized. Physicians should apply the Ottawa ankle rules to determine whether radiography is needed. According to the Ottawa criteria, radiography is indicated if there is pain in the malleolar or midfoot zone, and either bone tenderness over an area of potential fracture (i.e., lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, base of fifth metatarsal, or navicular bone) or an inability to bear weight for four steps immediately after the injury and in the emergency department or physician's office. Patients with ankle sprain should use cryotherapy for the first three to seven days to reduce pain and improve recovery time. Patients should wear a lace-up ankle support or an air stirrup brace combined with an elastic compression wrap to reduce swelling and pain, speed recovery, and protect the injured ligaments as they become more mobile. Early mobilization speeds healing and reduces pain more effectively than prolonged rest. Pain control options for patients with ankle sprain include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and mild opioids. Because a previous ankle sprain is the greatest risk factor for an acute ankle sprain, recovering patients should be counseled on prevention strategies. Ankle braces and supports, ankle taping, a focused neuromuscular training program, and regular sport-specific warm-up exercises can protect against ankle injuries, and should be considered for patients returning to sports or other high-risk activities.
