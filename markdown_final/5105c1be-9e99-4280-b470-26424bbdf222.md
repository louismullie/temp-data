## Question

Hyponatremia and low chloride

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient with hyponatremia and concurrent hypochloremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should classify volume status and integrate chloride into the differential. Next, I will correlate common etiologies that link low sodium and low chloride, and outline a prioritized diagnostic workup. After that, I need to stratify urgency and set safe correction targets. Finally, I will tailor therapy by etiology, highlight chloride-specific considerations, and specify monitoring and follow-up, while double-checking areas of controversy and risk mitigation throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states, because management hinges on true hypotonicity. I should measure serum osmolality and ensure it is less than 275 mOsm/kg to establish hypotonic hyponatremia, while checking for hyperglycemia, mannitol, or paraproteinemia that can artifactually lower measured sodium or create translocational hyponatremia, and I should correct sodium for glucose when needed before proceeding [^111ABycK] [^112Hzt6J] [^116Zh6gJ].

> Next, I should review volume status carefully, since the therapeutic fork in the road is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. I will examine for orthostatic vitals, mucous membranes, edema, and jugular venous distention, and I should obtain urine sodium and osmolality to refine the classification, recognizing that urine sodium less than or equal to 30 mmol/L suggests hypovolemia or hypervolemia with low effective arterial volume, whereas urine sodium greater than 30 mmol/L supports euvolemic SIADH or diuretic effects, and I need to remember that urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg indicates impaired free water excretion while less than or equal to 100 mOsm/kg suggests primary polydipsia or low solute intake [^115Bfw9m] [^111B44kt] [^1121fSgV] [^113VBoKn].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of chloride in this differential. Hypochloremia often travels with hyponatremia because chloride is the dominant extracellular anion and shares transport pathways, so a low chloride can reinforce hypovolemia, diuretic effects, or metabolic alkalosis, and in thiazide-associated hyponatremia, a low urine chloride can signal true volume depletion and help distinguish SIADH-like presentations, while in heart failure and cirrhosis, hypochloremia correlates with neurohormonal activation and diuretic resistance, so I should interpret chloride alongside sodium and acid-base status rather than in isolation [^113ejyCB] [^114Zxg8L] [^115v4BHs].

> Let me consider the common etiologies that plausibly present with both hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Thiazide diuretics are a classic cause via impaired dilution and natriuresis, often with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, and I should double-check for thiazide or trimethoprim exposure and stop the offending agent, while remembering a genetic predisposition in some patients. Gastrointestinal chloride losses from vomiting, nasogastric suction, or diarrhea can drive both sodium and chloride deficits. Renal salt wasting syndromes and adrenal insufficiency can present with hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia. And in cirrhosis and heart failure, hypochloremia tracks with neurohormonal activation and worse outcomes, so I need to check liver disease markers, renal function, and endocrine axes when the story fits [^111oUoRs] [^116mPvxH] [^115v4BHs] [^114Zxg8L].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup in a prioritized sequence. I need a focused medication history including thiazides, loop diuretics, SSRIs, carbamazepine, and PPIs, a dietary and fluid intake history, and a review of gastrointestinal losses. I should obtain thyroid-stimulating hormone and morning cortisol to exclude endocrine contributors, and in cirrhosis I should follow AGA guidance for a comprehensive evaluation including infection, bleeding, and secondary endocrine causes. Urine studies should include sodium, potassium, chloride, osmolality, and urea, with a low urea and low uric acid supporting SIADH, and I should calculate the simplified strong ion difference as serum sodium plus potassium minus chloride to help flag contraction alkalosis and diuretic effects when greater than 40 mmol/L [^1167NKvm] [^113VBoKn] [^115rmtPo].

> Wait, let me verify the urgency framework before jumping to therapy. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia with encephalopathy, seizures, or coma mandates immediate hypertonic saline, whereas moderate symptoms or sodium below 120 mEq/L require prompt but measured correction, and mild or asymptomatic cases allow time for a deliberate diagnostic workup. I should also remember that hypoxia, female sex, and pediatric status increase risk of hyponatremic encephalopathy and should lower my threshold for hypertonic therapy [^111V9Y4A] [^115PM8wK].

> For acute symptomatic hyponatremia, I should act quickly. 100 mL of 3% saline given over about 10 minutes as a bolus, repeated up to two additional times if needed, targets a 4 to 6 mEq/L rise to reverse cerebral edema, and I must stop once symptoms improve or once the total rise reaches about 10 mEq/L, keeping the overall 24-hour correction within 8 to 12 mEq/L to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk. I should double-check sodium every 2 to 4 hours initially and be prepared to administer desmopressin to prevent overcorrection if the rise is too brisk [^115PM8wK] [^1132UNHS] [^1169CfKA].

> For hypovolemic hyponatremia with hypochloremia, I should correct volume with isotonic saline while monitoring for a self-limited rise in sodium as vasopressin shuts off. I need to ensure chloride repletion as part of the sodium chloride load and consider oral salt tablets if ongoing chloride losses persist, and I should reassess urine indices after volume repletion to confirm the trajectory and avoid premature assumptions [^111WyraN].

> For euvolemic SIADH, fluid restriction is first-line, but hold on, I should verify predictors of poor response. High urine osmolality above 500 mOsm/kg and high urine sodium above 133 mmol/L predict nonresponse, in which case I should escalate to oral urea at 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg/day or consider vaptans with close monitoring for overcorrection, and I should remember that salt tablets alone are generally ineffective unless paired with a loop diuretic to create a solute load and enhance free water excretion, so I need to tailor the combination to the patient's tolerance and risk profile [^113PdLtM] [^112MGZPb] [^116Pp77B] [^1179StGt].

> For hypervolemic hyponatremia in heart failure or cirrhosis, I should avoid hypertonic saline except in life-threatening encephalopathy, and instead prioritize fluid restriction, treat the underlying disease, and consider albumin in cirrhosis for severe hyponatremia. I need to check for hypochloremia because it signals neurohormonal activation and diuretic resistance, and in select cases, sodium-free chloride supplementation may improve diuretic responsiveness and cardiorenal metrics, though I should confirm that this is adjunctive and not a substitute for disease-directed therapy [^112vKGeP] [^111Sj5ax] [^114Zxg8L].

> But wait, what if the low chloride is disproportionate to sodium? I should double-check for metabolic alkalosis from vomiting or diuretics, because chloride repletion can correct the acid-base disturbance and secondarily improve sodium handling, and in thiazide-associated hyponatremia, stopping the thiazide, repleting potassium and magnesium, and restricting free water are the cornerstones, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe symptoms. I also need to remember that hypochloremia independently predicts worse outcomes in cirrhosis and heart failure, so correcting chloride may carry prognostic value beyond simply tracking sodium [^111oUoRs] [^115v4BHs] [^114Zxg8L].

> I should confirm monitoring safeguards to prevent overcorrection. Frequent sodium checks every 2 to 4 hours during active correction, strict adherence to daily correction limits, and a low threshold to use desmopressin to cap the rise are essential, and I need to watch for early signs of osmotic demyelination such as dysarthria, dysphagia, and quadriparesis several days after correction. If overcorrection occurs, I should consider relowering sodium with desmopressin and hypotonic fluid under expert supervision [^1169CfKA] [^111fLWER].

> Next, I should review outpatient and longitudinal management. Once stabilized, I will address modifiable drivers such as medications, diet, and fluid intake, consider urea for recurrent SIADH, and in cirrhosis or heart failure I should monitor chloride trends as a potential biomarker of neurohormonal activation and diuretic response, recognizing that persistent hypochloremia may warrant chloride-targeted strategies alongside standard care [^116Pp77B] [^115v4BHs].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia, classify volume status with urine studies, integrate chloride into the differential to refine etiology, treat emergencies with hypertonic saline while respecting correction limits, and tailor definitive therapy to the cause with explicit attention to chloride repletion when indicated, because chloride is not just a bystander but often a key pathophysiologic signal and therapeutic target in this syndrome [^111fLWER] [^1169CfKA] [^115v4BHs].

---

Hyponatremia and low chloride most often reflect **hypotonic hyponatremia with chloride loss** from gastrointestinal or renal causes, or diuretic use [^115v4BHs]. The key is to **confirm hypotonicity** [^111ABycK], assess volume status, and check urine sodium/osmolality to distinguish hypovolemic, euvolemic (SIADH), or hypervolemic (HF/cirrhosis) states [^115evmgn]. Management is cause-specific: isotonic saline for hypovolemia, fluid restriction for SIADH, and strict water restriction with albumin for cirrhosis; **hypertonic saline is reserved for severe symptoms** [^1169CfKA]. Monitor sodium closely to avoid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination [^111V9Y4A], and correct chloride as needed to support acid-base balance and diuretic responsiveness [^114Zxg8L].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hyponatremia reflects **excess water relative to solute**, most often from impaired water excretion due to elevated vasopressin or excessive intake [^111fLWER]. Low chloride typically reflects gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea), renal losses (diuretics, salt-wasting nephropathy), or dilutional effects from water retention [^115v4BHs].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Hyponatremia can cause **nausea, headache, confusion, seizures, and coma** from cerebral edema; chronic cases carry risks of falls, osteoporosis, and cognitive impairment [^1169CfKA]. Low chloride contributes to metabolic alkalosis, reduces diuretic responsiveness, and is linked to worse outcomes in heart failure, cirrhosis, and critical illness [^114Zxg8L] [^115v4BHs].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

1. Serum osmolality**: Confirms hypotonic hyponatremia (< 275 mOsm/kg)** [^111ABycK]2. Urine sodium**: ≤ 30 mmol/L: hypovolemia; > 30 mmol/L: euvolemic/hypervolemic** [^115Bfw9m]3. Urine osmolality**: > 100 mOsm/kg: impaired water excretion; ≤ 100 mOsm/kg: primary polydipsia** [^114txMQH]4. Volume status assessment**: Hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic classification** [^114xRHnt]5. Serum chloride**: Identifies chloride loss and guides correction

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **volume status and symptoms**:

- **Hypovolemic hyponatremia**: isotonic saline to restore volume and chloride [^111WyraN].
- **Euvolemic hyponatremia (SIADH)**: fluid restriction, consider urea or vaptans [^113PdLtM] [^116Pp77B].
- **Hypervolemic hyponatremia (HF/cirrhosis)**: strict water restriction, albumin for cirrhosis, limit hypertonic saline [^111Sj5ax] [^112vKGeP].
- **Severe symptomatic hyponatremia**: hypertonic saline boluses (100 mL 3% NaCl) to raise Na by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly, then slow correction [^115PM8wK] [^1169CfKA].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

Frequent sodium monitoring is critical to avoid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination; **limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** [^1169CfKA]. Use desmopressin to prevent overcorrection when needed [^notfound]. Correct chloride to support acid-base balance and diuretic responsiveness [^114Zxg8L].

---

## Prognostic implications

Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and cognitive impairment [^1169CfKA]. Low chloride independently predicts higher mortality and renal dysfunction in cirrhosis and heart failure, underscoring the need for **early recognition and correction** [^115v4BHs] [^114Zxg8L].

---

Hyponatremia and low chloride reflect complex water–electrolyte disturbances; **accurate diagnosis and cause-specific therapy** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Fig. 1
Standardized Therapeutic Protocol of Hyponatremia at Our Institution. Details of the protocol was explained in the methods section. All the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia and received cause-specific treatments. Bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline was administered for patients with severe symptoms, until the symptoms improved. DDAVP, desmopressin; D5W, 5% dextrose in water; ECW, extra cellular water; i.v. intravenous injection; p.o. per os; SNa, serum sodium; UK, urine potassium; and UNa, urine sodium

Subsequently, we evaluated the SNa and urine sodium (UNa), urine potassium (UK), and urine output every 2–4 h during the first 48 h. Note that our remarkable degree of monitoring was to ensure safer and uniform treatment throughout the study.

We defined the initial 4-h urine output as "early urine output". We compared the SNa to the total amount of UNa and UK (UNa + UK) to predict the possibility of a subsequent spontaneous increase in the SNa. In case the SNa was ≤ UNa + UK, hyponatremia was assumed not to be corrected spontaneously due to the absence of electrolyte-free water in the urine, and 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h or diuretics were administered if hyponatremia persisted in the subsequent 4 h. Thus, 3% hypertonic saline was administered to patients with reduced ECW, and diuretics such as loop diuretics or tolvaptan were administered to patients without reduced ECW. Administration of 3% hypertonic saline was continued at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h until the SNa improved. We used this relatively aggressive protocol to avoid under-treatment, based on evidence that even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

5.4 Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection is an isotonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). Close clinical monitoring may be warranted.

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.5 Hypokalemia

Infusion of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection may result in hypokalemia, leading to arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, heart block, and rhabdomyolysis.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^1121fSgV]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to urine osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to attribute hyponatremia to relative excess water intake in patients with a urine osmolality ≤ 100 mOsm/kg.

---

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^1132UNHS]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients (inadequate response to initial management), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to discontinue IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline when symptoms improve, the serum sodium concentration increases by ≥ 10 mmol/L in total, or the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L, whichever occurs first.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^115VnHUc]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Several limitations merit discussion. Because of the observational nature of this study, causality cannot be inferred. Although we have attempted to control for APACHE-IV–predicted mortality, sex, and age, it remains possible that unmeasured confounders remain. Furthermore, a limitation of our dataset was that information about the nature of dysnatremia at admission (acute or chronic, symptomatic or asymptomatic), treatments, IV fluids, fluid balance, and cause of death was not available in our database. It is likely that in most patients in our cohort, except for patients with severe hyponatremia, hyponatremia was asymptomatic. Similarly, we think that except in patients with severe hyponatremia, the increase in sodium was mostly an unintentional treatment effect, a side effect of other treatments or fluid management. However, we could not verify this. Specific consideration should be given to serum chloride concentrations. As chloride and sodium concentrations show considerable collinearity, it is not possible to distinguish effects of increasing serum sodium concentrations from increasing serum chloride levels. Last, we performed our study in a population admitted from 2011 to 2017. Treatment may now be different with a trend toward more conservative fluid management and increasing use of relatively balanced electrolyte fluids that have a lower sodium concentration than normal saline. However, although this may influence the occurrence rate of increasing sodium, it is unlikely that this would alter the association between increasing sodium and outcome.

We show that an increase in serum sodium during the first 48 hours of ICU admission is associated with increased mortality in ICU patients with normonatremia or hypernatremia at admission. Only in patients admitted with severe hyponatremia (< 125 mmol/L), an increase in serum sodium was associated with lower mortality. Our findings should be confirmed in other settings, and future interventional trials are necessary to determine optimal policy, especially in patients with mild hyponatremia. Our findings suggest substantive increases in serum sodium should be avoided in patients with normonatremia and hypernatremia.

### Sodium chloride and potassium chloride (potassium chloride in sodium chloride) [^1148ioRA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may cause hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury.

The risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH) treated with high volume of hypotonic Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia, and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as diuretics, certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). See DRUG INTERACTIONS.

Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy, include pediatric patients, women (in particular, premenopausal women), patients with hypoxemia, and patients with underlying central nervous system disease. Avoid Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

Fluid Overload

Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, and the patient's underlying clinical condition, the intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause electrolyte disturbances such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states including central (e.g., pulmonary edema) and peripheral edema.

Avoid Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- Definition: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- Pathophysiology: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- Disease course: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^111nCZXq]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte alteration among hospitalized patients and it has been reported in 20–40% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Multiple causes of hyponatremia have been hypothesized in these patients. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) has been considered one of the main reasons leading to hyponatremia in this condition. SIAD can be secondary to cytokines release, in particular IL-6. Positive pressure ventilation can be another cause of hyponatremia due to SIAD. Other possible etiologies of hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients can be related to secondary hypocortisolism, nausea, vomiting, heart and kidney damage. Similar to many other clinical conditions, there is strong evidence that hyponatremia is associated with a worse prognosis also in patients with COVID-19 infection. In particular, hyponatremia has been identified as an independent risk of ICU transfer, need of non-invasive ventilation and death. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients is in principle acute and symptomatic and should be treated as such, according to the published guidelines. Therefore, patients should be initially treated with i.v. hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) infusion and serum [Na +] should be frequently monitored, in order to remain within a safe rate of correction. There is evidence showing that serum [Na +] correction is associated with a better outcome in different pathologies, including COVID-19 infection.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Biochemical and etiological characteristics of acute hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112BuaCU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can be classified as acute or chronic depending on its duration, and treatment options are tailored to this classification. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia in the Emergency Department (ED). The objective of this study was to identify characteristics to help diagnose and manage acute hyponatremia in the ED. Patients with acute hyponatremia in the ED were enrolled from a retrospective 2-year chart review. Eleven patients (0.8%) were identified with acute hyponatremia out of a total of 1321 hyponatremic patients. There were nine women and two men. The mean age was 48.9 years. The mean sodium (Na(+)) level was 115 ± 4 mmol/L. Accompanying biochemical abnormalities included hypouricemia and hypouremia with increased fractional excretions of uric acid (UA) and urea. The estimated amount of water intake ranged from 2.5 to 10 liters (mean, 5.1 ± 2.3 liters) during the day before ED presentation. All patients were treated with hypertonic saline and furosemide at a correction rate of 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L/h. No patients had neurological sequelae after treatment. The causes of acute hyponatremia included induction of abortion with oxytocin (n = 1), primary polydipsia on neuroleptic agents (n = 2), polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation for colonoscopy (n = 1), diuretic therapy for hypertension (n = 4), ecstasy use (n = 1), and weight-reducing herbal teas (n = 2). We conclude that in the right clinical setting, high free water intake and low serum urea and UA favor acute hyponatremia. A detailed drug history may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of acute hyponatremia.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Serum chloride concentrations and outcomes in adult patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115v4BHs]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis lead to pathophysiological changes that predisposes patients to different water, electrolyte, and acid-base alterations. Hyponatremia, found in 40–60% of patients with cirrhosis, has become a well-established prognostic marker (MELD-Na score) for short-term mortality prediction.

In contrast, the prognostic significance of other electrolytes, particularly serum chloride, remains less understood. As the principal anion in extracellular fluid and the second leading contributor to plasma tonicity, chloride plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. While the biological mechanisms linking dyschloremia to adverse events are still being elucidated, evidence suggests potential effects through alteration in serum pH, reduced cardiac contractility, immunosuppression, and activation of neurohormonal systems leading to excessive afferent renal artery vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion.

Recent studies have identified hypochloremia as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and critical illness. Hypochloremia can result from extrarenal chloride losses such as vomiting, burns or gastrointestinal fistulae, or from renal causes such as diuretics, salt losing nephropathy or adrenal insufficiency. It is also associated with hyponatremia in varying extracellular volume states including normal for example SIADH or hypothyroidism, low for example congestive heart failure or cirrhosis, and high for example early hyperglycemia, and with acid base disturbances such as respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Hypochloremia in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and CKD is an independent risk factor for increased mortality.

This systematic review aims to summarize the pertinent evidence on the association between serum chloride concentrations, mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI) in adult patients with cirrhosis.

### Association between serum chloride and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the general U.S. adult population: evidence from NHANES 2011–2018 [^112PT3HZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

High - sodium diets, with sodium chloride as the main source of sodium, have been firmly established as a major risk factor for the development of hypertension. Thus, the adoption of a low - sodium diet, including low sodium chloride intake, is highly advocated. However, some studies have disclosed the unfavorable impacts of low serum chloride levels on health. Although these studies were conducted on patients with hypertension, CKD, CVDs, CHF or those who are critically ill, the evidence regarding its potential role in the general population remains scarce.

In the human body, the principal sources of chloride are dietary table salt (sodium chloride) and salty foods. However, the regulation of serum chloride concentration isn't merely contingent upon dietary intake and renal mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that the immune system plays an extrinsic regulatory role in sodium homeostasis. An intriguing finding is that when this immune mechanism is blocked, there is selective chloride anion accumulation in the skin of individuals with salt - sensitive hypertension. The widely acknowledged normal range of serum chloride for an adult is 96 to 106 mmol/L. In our study, the serum chloride levels within the studied population ranged from 83 to 119 mmol/L. Subjects with higher serum chloride levels also exhibited significantly higher sodium levels and lower bicarbonate levels (Table 1). As Testani et al. have disclosed, although serum sodium and chloride are commonly assumed to be closely correlated, the serum sodium level can only account for less than 30% of the variability in serum chloride concentration. Significantly, the entire survival setback associated with low serum sodium can be ascribed to the serum chloride concentration. Furthermore, hypochloraemia in the absence of hyponatraemia turns out to be a particularly adverse prognostic indicator.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112vKGeP]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^111ABycK]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to serum osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that hyponatremia with a measured serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg reflects hypotonic hyponatremia.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^116XhAVB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^116Pp77B]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

In case of severe acute hyponatremia, 3% sodium chloride infusions will most likely remain standard of care because they have an even more rapid onset of effect and are easy to titrate. However, in the outpatient setting, in hospitalized patients with less severe and less acute hyponatremia, and in patients with triggers that are not easy to control such as psychotropic medications, urea could be a safe and effective treatment option at low costs. Importantly, a dose-effect relationship of urea on free water excretion may be present which is dependent on urinary osmolality. Randomized clinical trials against the criterion standard of 3% sodium chloride infusions in acute hyponatremia from SIADH or VRA in chronic SIADH would be needed to further evaluate to potential role of urea in the treatment of hyponatremia in SIADH.

Limitations

There were several limitations to this systematic review. First, evidence from randomized clinical trials does not exist and few studies even have control groups. In addition to confounding by indication for urea therapy, it is very likely that publication bias was also present since we only identified trials with positive treatment effects. Also, there was inconsistent handling of fluid restriction. Finally, treatment of the trigger situation (eg, infection, pain, brain trauma) itself can improve serum sodium concentration in SIADH patients and in uncontrolled trials this effect cannot be separated.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^113VBoKn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

### Hyponatremia in patients with infectious diseases [^112KbL7m]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hyponatremia may not infrequently be present during the course of an infection, does not cause specific symptoms and may be overlooked by clinicians. Nonetheless, it may reflect the severity of the underlying process. This review focuses on the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of hyponatremia associated with infectious diseases. In the majority of cases, the fall in serum sodium concentration is of multifactorial origin owing to increased secretion of the anti-diuretic hormone either appropriately or inappropriately. Inadvertent administration of fluids may worsen hyponatremia and prolong morbidity.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solute load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient. The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

### Dextrose and potassium chloride (Potassium chloride in dextrose) [^114z3mHv]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection is an isotonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). Close clinical monitoring may be warranted.

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital- acquired hyponatremia.

5.5 Hypokalemia

The infusion of solutions with Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may result in hypokalemia, leading to arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, heart block, and rhabdomyolysis.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112GSy2Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, is frequently encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. Symptoms are often unspecific and include a recent history of falls, weakness and vertigo. Common causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, heart failure as well as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIAD) and correct diagnosis can be challenging. Emergency treatment of hyponatremia should be guided by presence of symptoms and focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic hyponatremia.

### Hypochloremia and diuretic resistance in heart failure: mechanistic insights [^114Zxg8L]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent epidemiological studies have implicated chloride, rather than sodium, as the driver of poor survival previously attributed to hyponatremia in heart failure. Accumulating basic science evidence has identified chloride as a critical factor in renal salt sensing. Our goal was to probe the physiology bridging this basic and epidemiological literature.

Methods and Results

Two heart failure cohorts were included: (1) observational: patients receiving loop diuretics at the Yale Transitional Care Center (N = 162) and (2) interventional pilot: stable outpatients receiving ≥ 80 mg furosemide equivalents were studied before and after 3 days of 115 mmol/d supplemental lysine chloride (N = 10). At the Yale Transitional Care Center, 31.5% of patients had hypochloremia (chloride ≤ 96 mmol/L). Plasma renin concentration correlated with serum chloride (r = -0.46; P < 0.001) with no incremental contribution from serum sodium (P = 0.49). Hypochloremic versus nonhypochloremic patients exhibited renal wasting of chloride (P = 0.04) and of chloride relative to sodium (P = 0.01), despite better renal free water excretion (urine osmolality 343 ± 101 mOsm/kg versus 475 ± 136; P < 0.001). Hypochloremia was associated with poor diuretic response (odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.3–16.1; P < 0.001). In the interventional pilot, lysine chloride supplementation was associated with an increase in serum chloride levels of 2.2 ± 2.3 mmol/L, and the majority of participants experienced findings such as hemoconcentration, weight loss, reduction in amino terminal, pro B-type natriuretic peptide, increased plasma renin activity, and increased blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio.

Conclusions

Hypochloremia is associated with neurohormonal activation and diuretic resistance with chloride depletion as a candidate mechanism. Sodium-free chloride supplementation was associated with increases in serum chloride and changes in several cardiorenal parameters.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^11383hTT]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte Imbalance and BUN Increases

Determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Patients should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolytes imbalance: i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may occur during the use of thiazides and other diuretics. Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and may be lessened by the amiloride HCl component of this product. Hypochloremia usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Discussion

In this single-center retrospective observational study, we investigated the risk factors for overcorrection by enrolling 56 patients with chronic profound hyponatremia who underwent standardized therapeutic strategies including DDAVP administration at our institution. We found two clinically important observations. First, an initial low level of SNa was a statistically significant risk factor for overcorrection. Second, the rapid increase in the first 4 h of the treatment might be responsible for the overcorrection, as suggested by Fig. 2.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^1179StGt]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral Sodium Chloride (Salt Tablets)

Hyponatremia due to SIAD is predominantly caused by water retention rather than sodium deficiency (though a total body sodium deficit can accumulate in chronic SIAD due to compensatory pressure natriuresis). While intuitively attractive, salt tablets do not address this underlying cause, though there are some pathophysiologic mechanisms by which salt tablets may plausibly have benefit. In the context of low solute intake or natriuresis from loop diuretics, low-dose salt tablets may supplement sodium intake to replace sodium lost via physiological mechanisms. Alternatively, high-dose NaCl tablets can produce a renal solute load (akin to urea), as osmotic intake is important in affecting urine volume in SIAD, in which AVP concentrations are relatively static. Therefore, ingestion of sufficient salt could increase urine volume and endogenous water clearance. However, the osmotic equivalent of 30 g of urea, to facilitate up to 1000 mL of water clearance, is 15 000 mg of NaCl — far above the typical dosing of salt tablets published in hyponatremia (see Table 9). The use of salt tablets is further limited by palatability, potential nausea, and thirst. The mechanism by which salt tablets induce thirst in humans with hypotonic hyponatremia has not been studied, but preclinical studies have reported that experimentally increasing the osmolality of gastrointestinal fluid stimulated thirst-promoting medical preoptic nucleus glutaminergic neurons in mice. The aforementioned 2016 international registry study of SIAD treatment (n = 1524) reported use of salt tablets in 18% cases, often in combination with other therapies. In the 2014 European guidelines, oral sodium chloride was recommended as a second-line therapy in combination with loop diuretics, though this was classified as a weak recommendation with a low-quality evidence base, and though this combination is uncommonly used in clinical practice (only 0.3% of registry patients). Salt tablets are not mentioned in the US expert panel recommendations.

### Impact of treatment modalities on intensive care unit length of stay for patients admitted with severe hyponatremia [^114SR3cY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diversity in presentation and cause of hyponatremia leads to a wide array of treatment modalities which are selected based on severity, chronicity, volume status, and putative cause. Due to the variability in treatment selection, it is pertinent to identify the clinical impact of the various treatment modalities and rescue therapies to inform future care.

Objective

To evaluate the association between treatment modality and length of stay for patients with severe hyponatremiaMethods:This single-center, retrospective study included patients 18years of age or older with glucose-corrected serum sodium levels of < 125 mEq/L upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary endpoint was ICU length of stay, and its association with treatment modality was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression with the following explanatory variables: 3% sodium chloride, 1.8% sodium chloride or isotonic fluids, diuretics, proactive therapy, rescue therapy, nephrology consultation, baseline volume status, and pretreatment sodium level.

Results

Eighty-two patients were included with a median age of 65years old (Q1, Q3: 57, 72). The median glucose-corrected serum sodium was 116.3 mEq/L (Q1, Q3: 112.9, 120.5) and the median ICU length of stay was 3days (Q1, Q3: 2, 4). Multivariable analysis, adjusting for baseline serum sodium levels, revealed the use of proactive and early reactive therapy (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.71) and nephrology consultation (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.46) were associated with increased length of ICU stay.

Conclusions and Relevance

Nephrology consultation and the use of proactive therapies were associated with increased ICU length of stay. Accurate identification of patients at high risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome that may benefit from proactive therapies is imperative, as use of proactive therapies in low-risk patients may prolong length of stay.

### Maintenance intravenous fluids in children: AAP provides… [^1143PQnM]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Maintenance IV fluids provided to acutely ill children should be isotonic to prevent hyponatremia.
- Dextrose and potassium chloride can be added to isotonic maintenance fluids without risk of injury from hypertonicity. From the AFP Editors. Background The standard administration of hypotonic maintenance IV fluid in children has been based on an article from 1957 that recommends weight-based fluid and glucose for maintenance: 823–332). Electrolyte recommendations were based on levels in human and cow's milk. Recent evidence has shown that hypotonic maintenance fluid administration significantly increases the risk of hyponatremia. The most common electrolyte complication in hospitalized patients is hyponatremia, affecting approximately 15% to 30% of hospitalized children and adults. Commonly used hypotonic commercial solutions, 0. 2% sodium chloride and
0.

45% NaCl, have sodium concentrations of 34 mEq per L and 77 mEq per L, respectively. The sodium concentration in isotonic solutions is closer to plasma levels, with 0. 9% NaCl having a concentration of 154 mEq per L. Treatment The AAP recommends the use of isotonic solutions with adequate potassium chloride and dextrose for maintenance IV fluids in children; this recommendation significantly reduces the risk of hyponatremia without increasing other risks, including hypernatremia and acidosis. The recommendation is rated as strong and is based on well-designed randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. The number needed to treat with isotonic fluids is 8 to prevent hyponatremia and 28 to prevent moderate hyponatremia, compared with hypotonic maintenance fluids. Dextrose and potassium supplementation are commonly required in maintenance fluids for children and can be added to isotonic fluids.

Whereas glucose increases the fluid osmolality, glucose is readily absorbed and does not appear hyperosmolar to cells. Potassium supplementation minimally increases osmolality.

In addition, among the 56 patients, 6 (11%) from the "no-overcorrection" group died during hospitalization due to infectious disease (n = 4) or cancer (n = 2). Both of these conditions may have caused hyponatremia in these patients. Among the 50 patients who were discharged alive, 12 were lost to follow-up partly because they were referred to their family doctors or because they cancelled their outpatient visits unexpectedly. Among the 38 patients who were ultimately followed-up at our institution, there were no re-hospitalizations due to hyponatremia within a median follow-up of 822 (quartile, 199–1411) days.

### Hypochloremia is a noninvasive predictor of mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115yeCYk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and lethal disease characterized by obstructive vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction of the precapillary arterioles and ultimately causes right ventricular dysfunction and death. 1, 2 Despite progress in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of PAH in the past 2 decades, it remains a fatal illness with a median survival of 5 to 7 years. 1 PAH is frequently encountered in resource‐limited countries that often have limited access to tools that are employed to risk stratify patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) to help guide diagnosis and inform decisions on therapy implementation. 3 Risk assessment is pivotal in the management of PAH to improve outcomes, and several prognostic markers have been recommended by the current guidelines for risk stratification and treatment selection in patients with PAH. 4 However, many of these prognostic parameters require advanced or invasive testing. 4 Thus, there is an unmet need to define inexpensive and widely available biomarkers for prognostication and identification of patients at greatest need for therapy.

There is precedence for noninvasive markers having utility in risk stratification in PAH. For example, hyponatremia is associated with right ventricular dysfunction and reduced survival in PAH. 5 However, recent data from the heart failure literature suggest hypochloremia, and not hyponatremia, is the more predictive electrolyte abnormality for predicting poor outcomes in acute decompensated left heart failure 6 and in chronic heart failure. 7, 8 It is unknown whether serum chloride could serve as a simple, inexpensive, and widely available parameter for prognostication in PAH. There are limited data on the prognostic value of serum chloride levels in PAH patients. In idiopathic or heritable PAH patients low serum chloride levels (≤ 100 mmol/L), measured 6 months after diagnosis, were associated with higher mortality rates, even after adjustment for age, sex, pulmonary vascular resistance, and use of diuretics or prostacyclin. 9 Multicenter studies evaluating the utility of serum chloride levels to identify high‐risk PAH are lacking.

Thus, the aim of this article is to assess the prognostic value of serum chloride levels at the time of diagnosis in PAH patients referred to 2 designated PH centers. We hypothesized that a low serum chloride level is a noninvasive predictor of mortality in patients with PAH, independent of serum sodium, renal function, and diuretic use. We further tested how a noninvasive mortality prediction model using serum chloride compared with the French noninvasive prediction model.

### A review of drug-induced hyponatremia [^115oCpKe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium level < 134 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients. Certain drugs (eg, diuretics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics) have been implicated as established causes of either asymptomatic or symptomatic hyponatremia. However, hyponatremia occasionally may develop in the course of treatment with drugs used in everyday clinical practice (eg, newer antihypertensive agents, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors). Physicians may not always give proper attention in time to undesirable drug-induced hyponatremia. Effective clinical management can be handled through awareness of the adverse effect of certain pharmaceutical compounds on serum sodium levels. Here, we review clinical information about the incidence of hyponatremia associated with specific drug treatment and discuss the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741–7015/12/231.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^112q1gbT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^114pdHWw]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Serum chloride concentrations and outcomes in adult patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112n7Pt5]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia, are common in cirrhosis, with hyponatremia already incorporated into the MELD-Na score as a prognostic marker. However, the prognostic role of serum chloride, the main extracellular anion, remains underexplored. Emerging evidence suggests hypochloremia is independently associated with increased mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhotic patients. Proposed mechanisms include dysregulated activation of the renin-angiotensin, vasopressin, and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to renal vasoconstriction and impaired function. This systematic review evaluates the association between serum chloride levels and outcomes, including mortality and KDIGO-defined AKI rates, aiming to enhance understanding and inform management strategies.

Methods

This review followed PRISMA guidelines and a PROSPERO-registered protocol (CRD42024550945). Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science were conducted through June 6, 2024, without language restrictions. Controlled vocabulary and keywords were used to identify relevant studies. Two independent reviewers performed title, abstract, and full-text screening, with disagreements resolved through consensus or third-party arbitration. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen's kappa. Data extraction and risk of bias evaluations were performed using the PROBAST tool. Findings were summarized using a PRISMA flowchart.

Results

Five studies (n = 3,150) were included, primarily retrospective cohorts, with one prospective study. Hypochloremia was defined as serum chloride < 99 mEq/L in most studies, except one, which used < 107.35 mmol/L. Cirrhosis etiologies included alcohol-related liver disease (40–64%), hepatitis B (7.9–59.9%), hepatitis C (7–8.9%), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (7–11.7%), with fewer cases of autoimmune and cryptogenic causes. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (21.3%), hypertension (13.4%), and varices (72–87%), with 62–99% having a history of decompensation. Extrahepatic organ failures were prevalent, affecting 79.4% of patients, with 31.6% and 13.4% experiencing two and three organ failures, respectively. Meta-analysis showed hypochloremia was significantly associated with increased mortality (pooled OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.88–3.39, p < 0.0001). Individual ORs ranged from 2.08 to 17.42, with low to moderate heterogeneity (I² = 36%). Hypochloremia also correlated with elevated creatinine levels and increased AKI prevalence.

Conclusion

Hypochloremia is a strong predictor of mortality and renal dysfunction in cirrhotic patients. Early recognition and management of hypochloremia are critical to improving outcomes in this high-risk population.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^115rmtPo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing thiazide or thiazide-like treatment are at risk for hyponatremia, with a reported incidence of hyponatremia up to 30% in hospitalized patients. Patients with thiazide- or thiazide-like-associated hyponatremia (TAH) can either present with a diuretic-induced volume depletion and consequent hypovolemic hyponatremia, or with a picture of euvolemic hyponatremia mimicking a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), in which case it is referred to as SIAD-like TAH.

The European Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis and management of hypotonic hyponatremia propose a diagnostic algorithm based on urine indices (especially the measurement of urine osmolality and sodium) instead of the classical volume status assessment, of which the low sensitivity and specificity are well recognized. However, the use of urine indices is of little utility in patients with TAH, because thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics promote natriuresis and alter urine dilution. Fenske et al proposed the use of fractional uric acid excretion (FUA) in the differential diagnosis of TAH; however, their recommendation was based on data from only 7 patients.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics exert their mechanism of action not only on sodium, but also on chloride and potassium. We therefore aimed to evaluate the possible role of the imbalance between these 3 ions in the differential diagnosis of TAH. To do so, we calculated the simplified strong ion difference (serum sodium + potassium − chloride), a part of the Stewart model for acid-base disturbances. In brief, the Stewart model represents an alternative to bicarbonate-centered approaches and is especially used in anesthesiology and intensive care. According to Stewart, acid-base balance is the result of the strong ions difference (SID, calculated as the sum of measured cations minus the sum of measured anions), weak acids, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and aims to maintain electroneutrality in extracellular fluid. In stable patients with no critical illness (absence of severe hypoalbuminemia, of acute renal failure and/or respiratory failure), the simplified aSID could be sufficient to evaluate acid-base balance. A value > 40 mmol/L identifies patients with fluid depletion and contraction alkalosis due to relative hypochloremia, whereas a value < 40 mmol/L identifies patients with acidosis due to relative excess of water and therefore in need of fluid restriction.

### Management of hyponatremia… [^1153WXiP]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Total body sodium is primarily extracellular, and any increase results in increased tonicity, which stimulates the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion. Arginine vasopressin then acts on the V2 receptors in the renal tubules, causing increased water reabsorption. The opposite occurs with decreased extracellular sodium: a decrease inhibits the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion, resulting in diuresis. In most cases, hyponatremia results when the elimination of total body water decreases. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia will be discussed later in this article. Clinical Signs and Symptoms Most patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic. Symptoms do not usually appear until the plasma sodium level drops below 120 mEq per L and usually are nonspecific.

Low Urine Sodium Level Patients with extra-renal sodium loss have a low urinary sodium concentration as the body attempts to conserve sodium. Causes include severe burns and gastrointestinal losses from vomiting or diarrhea. Acute water overload, which usually is obvious from the patient's history, occurs in patients who have been hydrated rapidly with hypotonic fluids, as well as in psychiatric patients with psychogenic overdrinking. SIADH SIADH is an important cause of hyponatremia that occurs when normal bodily control of antidiuretic hormone secretion is lost and antidiuretic hormone is secreted independently of the body's need to conserve water. Antidiuretic hormone causes water retention, so hyponatremia then occurs as a result of inappropriately increased water retention in the presence of sodium loss. The diagnostic criteria for SIADH are listed in.

9, 10 In central pontine myelinolysis, neurologic symptoms usually occur one to six days after correction and often are irreversible. 19 In most cases of chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, removing the underlying cause of the hyponatremia suffices. 9 Otherwise, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment and the preferred mode of treatment for mild to moderate SIADH. 20 The combination of loop diuretics with a high-sodium diet may be required to achieve an adequate response in patients with chronic SIADH.

### Disorders of sodium [^113Bapty]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^115Jt9Z3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common lab abnormalities seen in clinical practice. It has become widely accepted that hypothyroidism is a cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. The primary mechanism is thought to be due to impaired free water excretion and changes in sodium handling in the kidney. However, the clinical studies are conflicting and do not definitively confirm the association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia. Therefore, if severe hyponatremia occurs in a patient without myxedema coma, other potential etiologies should be sought.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^113ejyCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Chloride and potassium balance in urine represents a sodium-independent marker of kidney response to diuretic-induced volume depletion. Processes going on at the level of intercalated cells are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence of a sodium-independent chloride reabsorption in response to changes in volume and metabolic status. A low urine chloride is a known sign of hypovolemia. It triggers renin release and intercalated cells activation, thus aggravating potassium depletion caused by thiazide. Therefore, we further aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of the balance between chloride and potassium in urine in the differential diagnosis of TAH. The goal of our analysis was to find an additional tool for the initial assessment of profound hyponatremia in the context of hospitalization and unreliable canonical urine indices.

5.4 Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection is an isotonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). Close clinical monitoring may be warranted.

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.5 Hypokalemia

Infusion of Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection may result in hypokalemia, leading to arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, heart block, and rhabdomyolysis.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people.

Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Table 2.
Prevalence of hyponatremia — summary of key studies in adults

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands of nearly 3000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250 000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200 000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring 2 sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L. There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia — for example, following pituitary surgery, where a meta-analysis showed 5.6% cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins, or erroneous results from hemolyzed or contaminated blood samples, are not specifically excluded.

Treatment protocol for Hyponatremia

All patients were treated using our standardized therapeutic protocol for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). This therapeutic protocol fundamentally complied with the international treatment recommendations on chronic profound hyponatremia, although it did involve an exceptionally aggressive strategy to avoid under-treatment. The steps in this protocol are carried out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. First, all the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia. This evaluation involved (1) an interview about the history of the present illness, (2) vital signs, (3) physical examination, (4) laboratory data, and (5) echocardiography, if appropriate. Urine osmolality ≦100 mOsm/kg suggested that the hyponatremia was caused by primary polydipsia or poor sodium intake. Patientsand received cause-specific treatments, such as water restriction for primary polydipsia, discontinuation of a drug that caused hyponatremia, and amelioration of physiological stimulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In addition, if patients had severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or cardiorespiratory distress, an intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline of weight-based (2 mL/kg) amount was initiated until the symptoms improved. When the patients were relieved from these severe symptoms, they were assessed to determine the extracellular water (ECW) status. Patients were considered to have hypovolemic hyponatremia if the following findings were present, along with the discretion of the attending physician: history of gastrointestinal loss, reduced oral intake, thiazide usage, reduced turgor, or prolonged capillary refill time on physical examination, urine Na ≦ 30 mEq/L, and collapsed IVC on echography. Hydration with 0.9% saline at 1 mL/kg/h i.v. was initiated for patients who were diagnosed with reduced ECW. The administration speed of 0.9% saline was increased to 2 mL/kg/h when the patient could not take food orally.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

Medications

Medications are an important cause of hyponatremia to consider. Medications can cause SIAD through stimulating AVP release, potentiating its action, contributing to altered osmotic set point, or being a direct AVP analogue (Table 5). Medications with a natriuretic effect can mimic SIAD by causing hypovolemic hyponatremia with an increased UNa concentration. Thiazide diuretics are one of the most common causes of hyponatremia and are an important differential diagnosis for SIAD. Up to 13% of patients taking thiazides develop hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics act at the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule to block sodium resorption, which impairs urinary dilution, resulting in free water retention and sodium excretion that can contribute to hyponatremia. A genetic susceptibility to thiazide-associated hyponatremia has been identified, with approximately 50% of those affected found to have a single-nucleotide variation in the SLCO2A1 gene encoding a prostaglandin transporter expressed in the renal collecting duct, a variant that activates water resorption in the collecting duct despite suppression of AVP. Thiazide-induced hyponatremia is likely to reoccur with repeat exposure, so should be recorded as an adverse reaction in the medical record. A rechallenge study in 11 patients with a history of previous thiazide-induced hyponatremia found that a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg caused a fall in serum sodium (mean 5.5 mmol/L) in 6 hours, but minimal change in controls. Other medications that cause hyponatremia and resemble SIAD through salt-wasting diuresis include the antibiotic trimethoprim (and by extension, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), especially at higher doses. Of course, these common medications and underlying organic SIAD also frequently coexist, so the presence of potentially hyponatremia-causing medication does not rule out SIAD.

### Treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in the critically ill [^115PM8wK]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyponatremic encephalopathy, symptomatic cerebral edema due to a low osmolar state, is a medical emergency and often encountered in the ICU setting. This article provides a critical appraisal and review of the literature on identification of high-risk patients and the treatment of this life-threatening disorder.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Online search of the PubMed database and manual review of articles involving risk factors for hyponatremic encephalopathy and treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in critical illness.

Data Synthesis

Hyponatremic encephalopathy is a frequently encountered problem in the ICU. Prompt recognition of hyponatremic encephalopathy and early treatment with hypertonic saline are critical for successful outcomes. Manifestations are varied, depending on the extent of CNS's adaptation to the hypoosmolar state. The absolute change in serum sodium alone is a poor predictor of clinical symptoms. However, certain patient specific risks factors are predictive of a poor outcome and are important to identify. Gender (premenopausal and postmenopausal females), age (prepubertal children), and the presence of hypoxia are the three main clinical risk factors and are more predictive of poor outcomes than the rate of development of hyponatremia or the absolute decrease in the serum sodium.

Conclusions

In patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy exhibiting neurologic manifestations, a bolus of 100mL of 3% saline, given over 10 minutes, should be promptly administered. The goal of this initial bolus is to quickly treat cerebral edema. If signs persist, the bolus should be repeated in order to achieve clinical remission. However, the total change in serum sodium should not exceed 5 mEq/L in the initial 1–2 hours and 15–20 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of treatment. It has recently been demonstrated in a prospective fashion that 500mL of 3% saline at an infusion rate of 100mL per hour can be given safely. It is critical to recognize the early signs of cerebral edema (nausea, vomiting, and headache) and intervene with IV 3% sodium chloride as this is the time to intervene rather than waiting until more severe symptoms develop. Cerebral demyelination is a rare complication of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia. The principal risk factors for cerebral demyelination are correction of the serum sodium more than 25 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of therapy, correction past the point of 140 mEq/L, chronic liver disease, and hypoxic/anoxic episode.

Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.4 Hypokalemia

Excessive administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in significant hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet, or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. Avoid the administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk of hypokalemia or taking medications that may increase the risk.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in Lactated Ringer's and 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may cause hyponatremia. Glucose intravenous infusions are usually isotonic solutions. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury.

The risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH) treated with high volume of hypotonic Potassium Chloride in Lactated Ringer's and 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia, and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as diuretics, certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Pediatric Use.

Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy, include pediatric patients, women (in particular, premenopausal women), patients with hypoxemia, and patients with underlying central nervous system disease. Avoid Potassium Chloride in Lactated Ringer's and 5% Dextrose Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

Management Principles

Figure 1 shows the application of the principles of management in a flow diagram. All principles are critical for optimizing successful patient outcomes. The principles addressing diagnosis are covered elsewhere. We have chosen to focus on the principles addressing the quantitative aspects of management in this report.
