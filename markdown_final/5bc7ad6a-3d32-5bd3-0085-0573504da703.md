## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for cardiac amyloidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10 code is for cardiac amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a single, specific ICD-10 code that captures "cardiac amyloidosis" as a standalone diagnosis. Then, I should verify the correct amyloidosis family codes and which subtypes map to AL versus ATTR disease. Next, I will check whether coding guidance or payer policies require pairing an amyloidosis code with a cardiac manifestation code to represent cardiac involvement. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with examples and caveats about coding variability and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the core issue: there is no single ICD-10-CM code that exclusively and specifically denotes "cardiac amyloidosis" as a unified entity. Instead, cardiac amyloidosis is represented by an amyloidosis code plus a cardiac diagnosis code to indicate organ involvement, which is how major epidemiologic studies and payer policies operationalize it in practice [^113vNnD6] [^113TNud2].

> I need to check the amyloidosis code family. The parent category is E85, and the clinically relevant subtypes include E85.81 for light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, E85.82 for wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, and E85.89 for other specified amyloidosis; E85.4 denotes organ-limited amyloidosis and is often used when cardiac involvement is suspected but the protein is not specified, though it is less specific than E85.81 or E85.82 [^113DczfC] [^112W3D7f] [^116Vo2DZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using E85.4 alone for "cardiac amyloidosis". I initially thought E85.4 might suffice, but wait, let me verify the coding nuance: E85.4 means organ-limited amyloidosis and is nonspecific for the precursor protein, so it does not by itself identify transthyretin versus light-chain disease; moreover, some studies and policies still require pairing with a cardiac diagnosis to represent cardiac involvement, reinforcing that E85.4 should be complemented by a cardiac code when cardiac disease is present [^116Vo2DZ] [^113TNud2].

> Next, I should review how cardiac involvement is coded. Practically, clinicians pair the amyloidosis code with a cardiac manifestation such as heart failure (I50.x), cardiomyopathy (I42.x or I43.x), or atrial fibrillation (I48.x) to indicate cardiac amyloidosis; this approach is explicitly used in large registry-based definitions and is consistent with payer guidance that lists amyloidosis codes alongside cardiac indications for advanced imaging [^113vNnD6] [^113TNud2].

> Let me consider concrete examples to make this actionable. For AL cardiac amyloidosis, use E85.81 plus a cardiac code such as I50.9 for heart failure or I42.9 for cardiomyopathy. For wild-type ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, use E85.82 plus a cardiac code. When the protein is not specified but cardiac involvement is documented, E85.4 plus a cardiac code is reasonable, recognizing the lower specificity and the need for clinical clarification in the record [^113DczfC] [^113TNud2].

> I should double-check payer and policy signals to ensure alignment. The ASNC model coverage policy for cardiac PET explicitly includes amyloidosis codes E85.4–E85.9 alongside cardiac indications, which operationalizes the concept that amyloidosis plus a cardiac diagnosis supports medical necessity for advanced imaging in suspected cardiac amyloidosis [^113TNud2].

> But wait, what if the record only lists "cardiac amyloidosis" without specifying AL versus ATTR or without a separate cardiac diagnosis? I need to ensure documentation supports coding specificity: if the clinician documents "cardiac amyloidosis" without further detail, coding to E85.9 (unspecified amyloidosis) plus a cardiac code is a conservative approach, with a plan to query the provider for AL versus ATTR and to secure a cardiac manifestation diagnosis to pair with the amyloidosis code for accuracy and optimal claims processing [^113TNud2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no standalone ICD-10-CM code for "cardiac amyloidosis". The correct approach is to use an amyloidosis code (E85.81 for AL, E85.82 for ATTRwt, or E85.4/E85.89/E85.9 when unspecified) together with a cardiac diagnosis code such as I50.x for heart failure or I42.x/I43.x for cardiomyopathy to represent cardiac involvement, consistent with epidemiologic definitions and payer policies [^113vNnD6] [^113TNud2].

The ICD-10 code for cardiac amyloidosis is **E85.4** (Organ-limited amyloidosis) [^113TNud2], used when amyloidosis primarily involves the heart. For more specific etiologies, use **E85.81** (Light chain amyloidosis) for AL cardiac amyloidosis and **E85.82** (Wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis) for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis [^113DczfC]. Always pair the amyloidosis code with a cardiac diagnosis (e.g. I42.9 cardiomyopathy, I50.9 heart failure) to document cardiac involvement [^113vNnD6].

## ICD-10 codes for cardiac amyloidosis

| **ICD-10 code** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| E85.4 | Organ-limited amyloidosis | General code for cardiac amyloidosis without specifying the amyloid protein |
| E85.81 | Light chain (AL) amyloidosis | Immunoglobulin light chain–related amyloidosis with cardiac involvement |
| E85.82 | Wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis | Age-related, non-hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis affecting the heart |
| E85.89 | Other amyloidosis | Hereditary or other specified amyloidosis with cardiac involvement |

---

## Coding guidelines and clinical documentation

- **Primary diagnosis**: Use the specific amyloidosis code (E85.4, E85.81, or E85.82) based on the documented amyloid type [^113DczfC].
- **Secondary diagnosis**: Add a cardiac diagnosis code (e.g. I42.9 cardiomyopathy, I50.9 heart failure) to indicate cardiac involvement [^113vNnD6].
- **Unspecified amyloidosis**: Use E85.9 only when the amyloid type is not documented; otherwise, use the specific codes above.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding for cardiac amyloidosis is essential for:

- **Epidemiological tracking**: Enables monitoring of disease prevalence and incidence [^1155KHCr].
- **Clinical management**: Supports appropriate treatment planning and multidisciplinary care [^115LNpwx].
- **Reimbursement**: Ensures appropriate billing and coverage for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions [^113TNud2].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Underdiagnosis**: Cardiac amyloidosis is frequently underrecognized, leading to undercoding [^116X9faX].
- **Coding variability**: Inconsistent use of specific amyloidosis codes can obscure true disease burden [^111yjtVm].
- **Documentation gaps**: Incomplete clinical documentation may necessitate use of unspecified codes, reducing specificity [^117F1Ghd].

---

The ICD-10 code for cardiac amyloidosis is **E85.4**, with more specific codes (E85.81, E85.82) used when the amyloid type is known; always pair with a cardiac diagnosis to document cardiac involvement [^113TNud2].

### Prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in patients undergoing echocardiography at a tertiary center [^116azfc6]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure worldwide. Once considered a rare disease, advancements in noninvasive diagnostic testing have led to increased diagnosis. However, CA likely remains underdiagnosed.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the prevalence of CA among adult patients undergoing clinically indicated echocardiography?

What is the main finding?

Of 31,027 patients undergoing echocardiography, 388 (1.25%) were found to have a diagnosis of CA; possible CA (inconclusive/unpursued confirmatory testing) was present in 165 (0.53%).

While recent data highlight important epidemiological trends, the prevalence of CA among patients referred for cardiac evaluation remains unknown. Echocardiography remains the cornerstone of this initial evaluation. Several "red flag" echocardiographic parameters have been suggested for CA, although are limited by lack of specificity, leading to delays in diagnosis. Echocardiographic machine-learning models to augment the detection of CA may allow for more widespread and earlier identification of CA. Development, testing, and clinical application of these models requires an estimation of pretest probability which relies on disease prevalence among those undergoing echocardiography; these data are currently lacking.

This retrospective, single-center, International Review Board-approved observational cohort study aimed to investigate the prevalence of both amyloid light chain (AL) and transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) CA in unselected adult patients undergoing a clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiogram at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota from January 1 to December 31, 2022. We included patients who consented to inclusion in research. Patients with prior heart transplantation were excluded.

We utilized International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes to identify patients with systemic amyloidosis. We simultaneously screened all echocardiogram reports for the presence or possible presence of CA based on the interpreting physician's description. Patients with ≥ 1 ICD-10 code and/or echocardiographic reports suggesting CA underwent further adjudication to confirm disease presence and classify disease type in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

### Impact of case and control selection on training artificial intelligence screening of cardiac amyloidosis [^11224Fgz]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

First, there are limitations to disease definitions by ICD9/10 codes. While we show similar results with our curated clinic cohort, many patients with amyloidosis by ICD-9/10 codes do not have confirmatory testing available for review in the EHR. We did note that of the 168 well-curated amyloid clinic patients, 165 (98.2%) had an ICD-9/10 code for amyloidosis, suggesting high sensitivity of the ICD9 codes for CA. Additionally, this resulted in models that showed strong performance in cross-validation, suggesting patient similarity. In the current training and testing population, patients with ICD 9/10 codes for amyloidosis appear to have similar clinical characteristics as well-curated CA cases, given that models trained on less curated cases still performed well in detecting well-curated cases, rather than simply detecting which ECGs were associated with ICD codes. Similarly, wall thickness and QRS amplitude (Table 1) in the ICD cohort were similar to the CA clinic cohort.

Second, our selection of cardiac involvement requires selected laboratory testing or echocardiographic assessment to be done within 180 days, which might bias toward more severe or obvious cases of CA. While this is similarly true for patients in amyloid clinic, this degree of label noise might both result in false positives and false negatives. Further work is required to bring these findings to the bedside. Importantly, given the underdiagnosis of amyloidosis, there are likely patients in the control cohort who have undiagnosed CA, limiting the potential model performance. Additionally, most models for CA screening are restricted to a few centers, so validating this model at other centers is key to understanding the generalizability of these findings. It is important to recognize that the predictive value of ICD codes may be different at different institutions. However, the analyses presented, namely: 1) assessing performance of models trained on less curated cases in detecting well-curated amyloid cases; and 2) clinical characteristics based on ECG characteristics and clinical cardiac characteristics provide a starting point for researchers to understand the predictive value of ICD 9/10 codes for amyloidosis at their institutions when training models.

### The incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in a large community-based cohort in Alberta, Canada [^114JGUXK]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the improved awareness of cardiac amyloidosis among clinicians, its incidence and prevalence is not well-described in a community setting. We sought to investigate the incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in the community.

Methods and Results

In the adult population of Alberta, we examined 3 cohorts: (1) probable cases of cardiac amyloidosis: the presence of physician-assigned diagnosis of amyloidosis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 code E85; ICD-9 277.3) and 1 or more health care encounter for heart failure (HF) (ICD-10 I50; ICD-9 428); (2) possible cardiac amyloidosis: the presence of clinical phenotypes suggestive of amyloidosis; and (3) a comparator HF cohort without amyloidosis. Between 2004 and 2018, 982 of the 145,329 patients with HF were identified as probable cardiac amyloidosis. During the same period, the incidence rates of probable cardiac amyloidosis increased from 1.38 to 3.69 per 100,000 person-years and the prevalence rates increased from 3.42 to 14.85 per 100,000 person-years (P trend < .0001). Patients with probable cardiac amyloidosis were more likely to be male, have a higher comorbidity burden, greater health care use, and poorer outcomes as compared with patients with HF without amyloidosis. A much larger group of patients was identified as possible cardiac amyloidosis (n = 46,255), with similar increase in prevalence from 2004 to 2018 (from 416 to 850 per 100,000 person-years).

Conclusions

The incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis has increased over the last decade. Given the advent of new therapies for cardiac amyloidosis and considering their high cost, it is imperative to devise strategies to screen, identify, and track patients with cardiac amyloidosis from administrative databases.

Feature selection

We identified all ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that were present in at least 2% of wild-type ATTR-CM patients in the IQVIA medical claims data. Each of these codes were then used as potential features for the machine learning model. Features derived from ICD codes of any amyloidosis condition (i.e. ICD-9 277.30 or ICD-10 E85) and a specific code for "cardiomyopathy in diseases classified elsewhere" that tends to accompany a cardiac amyloid diagnoses were removed, to ensure no information relevant to the diagnosis of ATTR-CM or cardiac amyloidosis was "leaked" to the machine learning model. Model features were created by using a hierarchical mapping of ICD codes at the Sub Chapter (diagnosis category), Major (diagnosis name), and Short Description (diagnosis description) levels, obtained from the ICD Data R package and derived from the 2016 release of ICD-10-CM. New codes added after 2016 used the 2019 release of ICD-10-CM.

### Two decades of cardiac amyloidosis: a Danish nationwide study [^113vNnD6]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Regulatory approval

The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Registry studies do not require regulatory approval in Denmark. The study received the mandated approval by the Danish Data Protection Agency (approval no.: P-2019-348).

Data sources

Data were extracted from Danish national registries, where all inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, admissions, procedures, and filled prescriptions, as well as income and municipality of residence, are registered. The registries have been validated and previously described in detail.

Study patients

All patients diagnosed with amyloidosis from 1998 to 2017 were assessed for inclusion in the study. CA was defined as any International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for amyloidosis, combined with 1 possible cardiac manifestation of amyloidosis (diagnosed heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or atrial fibrillation or procedural code for pacemaker implantation), whichever was registered first. The ICD-10 codes used are listed in the Supplemental Appendix. Index date was defined as the date when the patient met both of these criteria (amyloidosis and a relevant cardiovascular diagnosis). This definition of CA has been used previously by Gilstrap et al, with the addition of atrial fibrillation and pacemaker implantation, as suggested in the subsequent editorial by Griffin et al.

For comparison, we also included control subjects from the general population in a 1:4 ratio. The control subjects were assigned the same index dates as cases (with the requirement of being alive and living in Denmark at the time) and were thereafter matched by sex, age (± 1 year), and index year, with the use of risk-set matching. To assess differences over time, the 20-year study period was divided into four 5-year periods. Furthermore, the population of amyloidosis patients who did not meet criteria for CA were analyzed as well. The index date for patients with noncardiac amyloidosis was defined as the date of diagnosed amyloidosis.

Study covariates

Preexisting comorbidities were assessed via hospital admissions and outpatient diagnoses from 10 years before the index date. Concomitant pharmacotherapy was assessed through filled prescriptions 6 months before the index date. The ICD-10 and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes used are listed in the Supplemental Appendix.

### Two decades of cardiac amyloidosis: a Danish nationwide study [^111yjtVm]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Strengths and limitations

The national registries provide an essentially complete follow-up in all in- and outpatient diagnoses. The procedure codes and cardiovascular diagnosis codes in the registries are validated and have high positive predictive values. Although ICD-10 allows for increased specificity in coding of the type of amyloidosis, the use of these codes is not yet well implemented in clinical practice, as was apparent in this study, where the majority of patients were coded as unspecified amyloidosis (DE859). To circumvent this, we created a surrogate measure for CA (code for amyloidosis + code for one of heart failure/cardiomyopathy/atrial fibrillation or procedural code for pacemaker implantation), based on previous work by Gilstrap et al and the review by Griffin et al. This definition is neither 100% sensitive or specific, so it will both include patients without CA and miss patients with CA. Thus, a portion of the data will not be representative of "true" CA.

Because of the definition of CA used, cardiovascular comorbidities and associated pharmacotherapy are logically more prevalent in cases than in age- and sex-matched control subjects. However, the temporal changes of these variables among case and control subjects are interesting to compare because they reflect introduction of novel therapeutic options and revisions of guidelines. Comparison between patients with CA and patients with noncardiac amyloidosis is limited by inherently different definitions of index date (date at meeting criteria for CA vs date of diagnosed amyloidosis).

Due to the descriptive nature of the study, causal relationships cannot be assessed. Important information such as body mass index, smoking, family history, left ventricular ejection fraction, electrocardiography readings, and blood samples were not available for analysis. Data on race are not available in the registries that we used.

### Two decades of cardiac amyloidosis: a Danish nationwide study [^111gr2Xa]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1,572 patients were diagnosed with amyloidosis during the study period, of whom 619 met the criteria for CA. Figure 1 shows a flow chart for patient selection. Matching in a 1:4 ratio to patients from the general population yielded 2,476 control subjects. The majority (63%) of CA patients were coded as unspecified amyloidosis, while hereditary forms accounted for about 10% (Supplemental Table 1 details further distribution of amyloidosis ICD codes among the study population). Approximately 62% of the CA patients were first diagnosed with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or atrial fibrillation or underwent pacemaker implantation before being diagnosed with amyloidosis and 7% were diagnosed with a cardiac manifestation and amyloidosis the same day.

Figure 1
Flow Chart of Patient Selection

All patients with diagnosed amyloidosis from 1998 to 2017 were identified in Danish nationwide registries. Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) was defined using a combination of International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision diagnosis and procedural codes. A total of 1,572 amyloidosis patients were identified, ∼40% of which met criteria for CA. CA, as defined in this study, is increasingly being diagnosed in Denmark.

### Increasing rate of hospital admissions in patients with amyloidosis (from the national inpatient sample) [^115PCvBj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction with emerging treatment options. We sought to analyze the temporal trends and impact of hospital admissions in patients with amyloidosis. The National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify patients from 2005 to 2014 who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of amyloidosis using ICD9 codes. Trends over time of prevalence, demographics, co-morbidities, and outcomes were described. Propensity-matching was used to assess the impact of amyloidosis on in-hospital outcomes, including mortality. A total of 156,914 admissions in patients with amyloidosis (age 69.86 ± 12.33 years, 45.7% female, 68.5% Caucasian) were identified. Hospitalizations more than doubled with a peak of 21,740 per year and 62 per 100,000 admissions in 2014. Over time, patients admitted with amyloidosis were older and more likely to have co-morbid medical conditions. A diagnosis of heart failure was present in 34.7% of patients, increased over time (p = 0.001), and was associated with further morbidity and mortality. In a propensity-matched analysis, patients admitted with amyloidosis had a longer length of stay (7.5 vs 6.2 days), were less likely to be discharged home (43.6% vs 48.7%), and were more likely to die during the hospitalization (7.4% vs 4.9%, p < 0.001 for all). In conclusion, inpatient hospitalizations in the United States in patients with amyloidosis have increased over time and are associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly when there is concomitant heart failure.

### Diagnostic pathways, cardiac manifestations and outcomes in light chain amyloidosis: analysis of a US claims database [^111oiYma]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings highlight the importance of timely diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. This may be achieved by raising physician awareness of cardiac amyloidosis and emphasising the urgency of accurate typing and diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Improved systems and tools are also required to facilitate early diagnosis, for example, artificial intelligence-based assessment of electrocardiograms that may raise suspicion of AL amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis-sensitive and specific imaging tracers that may abrogate the need for invasive biopsies with lengthy waiting times.

The IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims database primarily includes commercially insured patients. Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to those who are uninsured or Medicare or Medicaid populations. These populations may be relevant because AL amyloidosis is more common in the elderly population. The current study included patients with AL amyloidosis who were identified using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in the claims database. Therefore, there is a likelihood that patients with AL amyloidosis who were not identified using ICD-10 diagnostic codes were not captured in the study. This selection bias is an inherent limitation of observational studies using a claims database. The database only includes data from the USA; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the global diagnostic pathway in AL amyloidosis. The paucity of clinical details in the claims database makes it challenging to correlate claims with manifestations. There could be a possibility that patients were already diagnosed with AL amyloidosis beyond the timeframe specified in this study. Therefore, it is possible that some patients were not newly diagnosed at the time of diagnosis. Crucially, our study captures only patients who were treated within 6 months of diagnosis and would not include patients who died before treatment was initiated or those whose treatment was initiated 6 months after diagnosis; the diagnostic pathway for such patients may well differ.

### Impact of case and control selection on training artificial intelligence screening of cardiac amyloidosis [^113VtnxM]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Case and control definitions and test populations

Three progressively more selective definitions of amyloid were evaluated to understand whether more highly curated amyloid cases result in models with better screening performance or whether models trained with less curated cases can achieve similar performance. The broadest case definition used was a diagnosis of amyloidosis by ICD-9/10 code (n = 990). The second case definition was for CA, defined by a subset of patients from the first cohort but also having evidence of cardiac involvement (n = 686). Cardiac involvement was defined as having an abnormal interventricular septum (IVS) measurement, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or troponin within 180 days of ECG. 180 days was chosen given the indolent nature of amyloidosis development. The third case cohort were patients seen in cardiac amyloid clinic (n = 168) with documented diagnosis by biopsy or 99mTc-technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy (PYP) scan after ruling out circulating monoclonal proteins by serum free light chains, as well as serum and urine immunofixation. Different populations of non-amyloid patients (defined as patients without an amyloidosis ICD-9/10 code) were chosen as controls. Control cohorts chosen for comparison include all non-amyloid patients, non-amyloid patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, non-amyloid patients with heart failure, and non-amyloid patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In various experimental setups, cases and controls were matched on different combinations of age, sex, wall thickness, and QRS amplitude to understand how these variables affected model performance. Wall thickness measurements were obtained from the closest echocardiogram within 180 days of the ECG. Case and control ratios were always 1:10 (as 1:1 and 1:100 ratios showed no significant difference in model performance, as shown in Supplemental Table 2), except for HFrEF, where a ratio of 1:4.5 was used as HFrEF cases were uncommon in the control set.

### Impact of case and control selection on training artificial intelligence screening of cardiac amyloidosis [^113mDhoF]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest that cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is significantly underdiagnosed. For rare diseases like CA, the optimal selection of cases and controls for artificial intelligence model training is unknown and can significantly impact model performance.

Objectives

This study evaluates the performance of electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform-based artificial intelligence models for CA screening and assesses impact of different criteria for defining cases and controls.

Methods

Using a primary cohort of ∼1.3 million ECGs from 341,989 patients, models were trained using different case and control definitions. Case definitions included ECGs from patients with an amyloidosis diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases-9/10 code, patients with CA, and patients seen in CA clinic. Models were then tested on test cohorts with identical selection criteria as well as a Cedars-Sinai general patient population cohort.

Results

In matched held-out test data sets, different model AUCs ranged from 0.660 (95% CI: 0.642–0.736) to 0.898 (95% CI: 0.868–0.924). However, algorithms exhibited variable generalizability when tested on a Cedars-Sinai general patient population cohort, with AUCs dropping to 0.467 (95% CI: 0.443–0.491) to 0.898 (95% CI: 0.870–0.923). Models trained on more well-curated patient cases resulted in higher AUCs on similarly constructed test cohorts. However, all models performed similarly in the overall Cedars-Sinai general patient population cohort. A model trained with International Classification of Diseases 9/10 cases and population controls matched for age and sex resulted in the best screening performance.

Conclusions

Models performed similarly in population screening, regardless of stringency of cases used during training, showing that institutions without dedicated amyloid clinics can train meaningful models on less curated CA cases. Additionally, AUC or other metrics alone are insufficient in evaluating deep learning algorithm performance. Instead, evaluation in the most clinically meaningful population is key.

### Epidemiology of cardiac amyloidosis-associated heart failure hospitalizations among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in the United States [^1155KHCr]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Cardiac amyloidosis is a substantially underdiagnosed disease, and contemporary estimates of the epidemiology of amyloidosis are lacking. This study aims to determine the incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis among Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 to 2012. Methods and Results Medicare beneficiaries were counted in the prevalence cohort in each year they had (1) ≥ 1 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for amyloidosis and (2) ≥ 1 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for heart failure or cardiomyopathy within 2 years after the systemic amyloidosis code. A beneficiary was counted in the incidence cohort only during the first year in which they met criteria. Primary outcomes included the prevalence and incidence of hospitalizations for cardiac amyloidosis. There were 4746 incident cases of cardiac amyloidosis in 2012 and 15737 prevalent cases in 2012. There was also a significant increase in the prevalence rate (8 to 17 per 100000 person-years) and incidence rate (18 to 55 per 100000 person-years) from 2000 to 2012, most notable after 2006. Incidence and prevalence increased substantially more among men, the elderly, and in blacks. Conclusions The incidence and prevalence rates of cardiac amyloidosis are higher than previously thought. The incidence and prevalence rates of cardiac amyloidosis among hospitalized patients have increased since 2000, particularly among specific patient subgroups and after 2006, suggesting improved amyloidosis awareness and higher diagnostic rates with noninvasive imaging. In light of these trends, cardiac amyloidosis should be considered during the initial work up of patients ≥ 65 years old hospitalized with heart failure.

The study included ECGs from patients receiving care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between 2005 and 2022. The data were split 80% for training, 10% for internal validation, and 10% for testing on a patient level prior to model development; when multiple ECGs were present for a given patient, all were included in the same split, such that a patient in the training split had no ECGs in the validation or test splits, and vice versa. Similarly, to allow for accurate comparison between models trained with different case and control criteria, splits remained the same, such that all models developed, irrespective of inclusion and exclusion criteria, were trained on data from the train split and were evaluated on the held-out test split. All training cohorts were matched 1:10 on cases and controls coming from the training split. Models were evaluated on ECGs from the held-out test split, with cohorts that matched training cohort selection criteria as well as the entire test split (population prevalence). The entire test split (referred to as the Cedars-Sinai general patient population cohort) contained 1,130 ECGs from 105 patients with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 code of amyloidosis and 133,375 control ECGs from 34,089 patients. ECG waveform data, acquired at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, were extracted as 10 second, 12x5000 matrices of amplitude values. ECGs with missing leads were excluded from the study cohort. Associated clinical data for each patient, including demographic and clinical characteristics (eg, age, sex, body mass index, cardiovascular disease), were obtained from the electronic health record (EHR). Disease diagnoses were identified by ICD 9th and 10th edition codes, which were also obtained from the EHR. The Institutional Review Boards of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Stanford Healthcare approved the study protocol.

Cohort generation

Supplementary Table 5 lists all of the cohorts used for model training, testing, and validation, and includes a complete set of rules that were used to create these cohorts. Two sets of case/control cohorts of patients were created for model training from the IQVIA data. Wild-type ATTR-CM cases included patients with a diagnosis code specific to this type of amyloidosis (ICD-10 code E85.82) along with a diagnosis code for HF; controls included patients diagnosed with HF, who did not have a diagnosis of any type of amyloidosis or amyloid-related conditions. For each patient in the wild-type ATTR-CM cohort, a patient was selected from the non-amyloid HF cohort using a propensity score matching algorithm, with age, gender, duration of medical history in the database, and number of healthcare visits as matching parameters. An additional case/control cohort for validating the model was created for patients with cardiac amyloidosis; patients with organ-specific amyloidosis (ICD-10 code E85.4) and HF were selected and 1: 1 propensity-matched with non-amyloid HF controls. Propensity score matching was performed in R using the MatchIt package.

Cardiac amyloidosis is an umbrella term that includes the diagnosis of wild-type ATTR-CM, hereditary ATTR-CM, and amyloidogenic light chain amyloidosis with cardiac involvement. Whether a patient with ATTR-CM is coded as wild-type ATTR-CM or the more general term of cardiac amyloidosis can vary based on clinical practice patterns and billing practices. For this reason, we evaluated model performance in both wild-type ATTR-CM and cardiac amyloidosis validation cohorts (see the Supplementary Materials for further details). Within the cohorts that used the general cardiac amyloidosis term (Cohorts 3, 4, and 5), when defining cases we excluded blood cancers (reflective of amyloidogenic light chain cases) and other non-ATTR-CM-related amyloidosis terms, with the goal of capturing cases that had wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM but were coded as the more general cardiac amyloidosis term.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: more than a needle in a haystack [^116X9faX]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis has emerged as an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure (HF) that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in later stages of disease. Small, single-center studies have estimated the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis at 13% among patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, including among those hospitalized for HF. Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis has been detected in 13% to 16% of patients with severe aortic stenosis referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and is also associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Significant advances in noninvasive diagnostic testing and targeted amyloid therapeutics have piqued clinical enthusiasm for diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis; however, diagnostic delays of up to 34 months persist. The scope and consequences of cardiac amyloidosis underrecognition are poorly characterized both from the clinical outcomes perspective and from the policy and reimbursement perspective, with potentially important implications for both.

In this issue of JACC: CardioOncology, Arora et al. report on their examination of the prevalence of HF hospitalization for cardiac amyloidosis and associated in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates from January 2010 to August 2015 using the Nationwide Readmissions Database. HF hospitalizations for cardiac amyloidosis were identified as those with a primary diagnosis of HF and a secondary diagnosis of amyloidosis by International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes; amyloidosis type was not specified in the database. HF hospitalizations with amyloidosis were matched 3:1 to nonamyloidosis HF hospitalizations, and rates of in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission were compared between patients hospitalized for HF with and without amyloidosis. Among 1,593,360 HF hospitalizations included in the study, 2,846 (0.18%) were coded as being associated with amyloidosis. Rates of in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission were 4% and 22%, respectively, in the entire matched cohort. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographics and comorbidities, amyloidosis was associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.82) and 30-day readmission (odds ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.31), driven by noncardiovascular readmissions.

### Two decades of cardiac amyloidosis: a Danish nationwide study [^117QR3H3]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has been associated with poor outcomes. Screening studies suggest that CA is overlooked — especially in the elderly. Recent advances in treatment have brought attention to the disease, but data on temporal changes in CA epidemiology are sparse.

Objectives

The aim of this work was to describe all patients with CA in Denmark, examining changes in patient characteristics from 1998 to 2017.

Methods

All patients with any form of amyloidosis diagnosed from 1998 to 2017, as well as their comorbidities and pharmacotherapy, were identified in Danish nationwide registries. CA was defined as any diagnosis code for amyloidosis combined with a diagnosis code for heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or atrial fibrillation or a procedural code for pacemaker implantation, regardless of the order. The index date was defined as the date of meeting those criteria. Patients were divided into 5-year periods by index date. For comparison, we also included control subjects (1:4 ratio) from the general population.

Results

CA criteria were met by 619 patients. Comparing 1998–2002 vs 2013–2017, the median age at baseline increased from 67.4 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 53.9–75.2 years) to 72.3 years (IQR: 66.0–79.3 years). The frequency of male patients increased from 62.1% to 66.2%. The incidence of CA rose from 0.88 to 3.56 per 100,000 person-years in the Danish population aged ≥ 65 years, and the 2-year mortality decreased from 82.6% (IQR: 69.9%-90.5%) to 50.2% (IQR: 43.1%-56.9%). Compared with control subjects, the mortality among CA patients was significantly higher (log-rank test: P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

CA, as defined in this study, was increasingly diagnosed on a national scale. The increasing frequency of male patients and median age suggest that wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis is driving this increase. Greater recognition of earlier, less advanced cases might explain decreasing mortality.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement in patients with coexisiting amyloidosis: mortality, stroke, and readmission [^111D2KZp]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

We queried the NRD for all hospital discharges in the United States between January 2016 and December 2019. The NRD is part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project created by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The 2016 to 2019 NRD includes hospital discharge data from 30 States and accounts for 56.6 to 60.4% of all hospitalizations in the United States. All data are publicly available and de-identified, and the analysis was exempt from institutional review board approval.

Study population and data collection

All hospitalizations for TAVR were identified using the corresponding International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-PCS procedure codes (Supplemental Appendix). After exclusion of hospitalizations with missing mortality data, the cohort was categorized according to the presence or absence of any diagnosis of amyloidosis using the ICD-10-CM diagnoses codes E85(.x). These codes were previously used to identify CA when combined with a cardiac diagnosis. The primary cohort was used for analysis of in-hospital mortality and acute ischemic stroke. The ICD-10 CM code used for identifying acute ischemic stroke (I63) was previously validated with a positive predictive value of 92.7%. Seven other hospital adverse events were identified using ICD-10-CM/PCS codes: acute hemorrhagic transformation or stroke (using validated codes I60 and I61), acute myocardial infarction, acute bleeding, acute kidney injury, ventricular arrhythmia, permanent pacemaker implantation, and conversion to surgical valve replacement (Supplemental Appendix). A secondary cohort was identified for analysis of the 30-day readmission rate after exclusion of hospitalizations that resulted in mortality and hospitalizations in the months of December (as the NRD does not cross the calendar year). All baseline medical comorbidities were identified using ICD-10-CM diagnoses codes (Supplemental Appendix).

### Nationwide prevalence and characteristics of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in Sweden [^115C5U9N]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Swedish national population-based registers. Patients were identified between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2018 and were followed until death or end of study period. For each patient, a minimum of 10 years look-back period was used to identify exclusion criteria, comorbidities and red flags.

Data sources

Patient-level data were extracted from the National Patient Register, the Prescription Drug Registerand the Cause of Death Register, and linked together using unique personal identifiers. The National Patient Register provides information on diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), hospitalisations and outpatient specialist visits, as well as surgical and non-surgical procedures. The Prescription Drug Register contains data on all prescriptions filled at pharmacies, and the Cause of Death Register provides the confirmed dates of death and the registered cause of death. Due to mandatory reporting these national registers have a high degree of completeness. All data were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, the data holder of the national registers used in this study. Data can be obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare on approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.

Patient identification

Patients were identified retrospectively based on a combination of diagnosis codes as there is no specific ICD code for ATTR-CM. An algorithm was developed to identify patients with ATTR-CM. Figure 1 describes the process of patient identification.

Figure 1

Data extraction

We first extracted all patients with an ICD-10 code for amyloidosis (AM) diagnoses (E85.0, E85.1, E85.2, E85.4, E85.8, E85.9), cardiomyopathy (CM) diagnoses (I42.0, I42.1, I42.2, I42.5, I42.8, I42.9, I43.1, I43.8) or HF diagnoses (I50*). The study population included all adult patients in Sweden with any of these diagnoses between 2008 and 2018.

### A machine learning model for identifying patients at risk for wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111faMqZ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Dataset curation

The primary dataset used for training and testing the model was sourced from IQVIA, Inc. (Durham, NC), and was composed of medical claims for patients with ICD diagnosis codes for HF and amyloidosis (listed in Supplementary Table 5). The use of a date range (observation window) of 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2019 yielded a dataset of ~300 million US patients. If an ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 code was present in the claim, it was extracted and added to a list of diagnoses for each patient. A secondary dataset used for validating the model was sourced from the Optum® de-identified Electronic Health Record dataset (Optum, Inc. Eden Prairie, MN) and comprises clinical information derived from EHRs. The date range (observation window) of 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018 resulted in a dataset of ~88 million US patients. Patient diagnosis history in the form of ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 codes was extracted from the diagnosis table within the EHR dataset and was added to a list of diagnoses for each patient. Use of the IQVIA and Optum datasets was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was waived under Northwestern University's IRB regulations, as these are de-identified datasets. The use of IQVIA and Optum patient data (model training and initial validation portions of the study) was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Prior to training the machine learning algorithms, all ICD-9 codes were converted to ICD-10 codes. Only the presence or absence of the ICD codes (and not the temporal sequence of ICD codes) were included as features for training the machine learning algorithm.

Amyloidosis involves deposits of proteins that have become misfolded, going from a normal soluble state to an insoluble structure. These proteins are produced by the bone marrow and may be localized, with amyloid protein deposited in the organ or tissue where the protein was produced; or systemic, where fibrils of amyloid protein are carried through the plasma of the blood and deposited at one or more sites distant.

### Amyloidosis and 30-day outcomes among patients with heart Failure: a nationwide readmissions database study [^117F1Ghd]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

First, owing to the observational nature of our study design, there is potential for residual confounding that may underlie the observed association between presence of amyloidosis and risk of adverse outcomes. Thus, our observations do not establish a causal association between amyloidosis and risk of adverse outcomes among patients with HF. Although we matched on CCI, the actual comorbidities in patients with and without amyloidosis were different; therefore, matching on CCI would not fully account for these differences and bias could exist if different comorbidities had different impacts on patient outcomes in HF. However, after adjusting for multiple myeloma, similar results were seen for inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission. Second, the NRD is a database of linked inpatient discharge records, so we were unable to capture mortality outside of hospitalizations and could not account for the competing risk of deaths outside of the hospitals when calculating readmissions. Third, we only evaluated the association between diagnosis of amyloidosis and risk of first hospitalization within 30 days. This is consistent with the rehospitalization outcome assessed in most claims-based studies and HF clinical trials. The competing risk of non-CV or CV hospitalization for the other type of hospitalization was not accounted for in this study. However, the rates of recurrent hospitalization within a 30-day period is low, and thus the competing risk would have a modest effect on the observed associations. Fourth, as only hospitalizations within the same state would be linked, we would have missed all readmissions that occurred outside of the state of index hospitalization. However, we restricted our cohort to those that were residents of the state that they were initially treated in to minimize this limitation of the database. Fifth, we could not assess whether patients with HF and amyloidosis had amyloidosis with cardiac involvement or determine the type(s) or genetic mutations of amyloidosis, given how the diseases are captured in ICD-9-CM codes. Furthermore, lack of data on disease severity, both for amyloidosis (extent of multisystem involvement) and HF (ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class, cardiac biomarkers) as well as details of any treatment for both diseases precludes us from adjusting for those critical factors in the model as well. Sixth, there was also a potential for coding errors and differences in coding practices across the hospitals included in the database. Although the sensitivity and specificity of the ICD-9-CM codes for the diagnosis of amyloidosis are not available, the ICD-9-CM codes used to identify amyloidosis are consistent with those reported previously in the literature. Coding errors and missing codes could have caused us to underestimate the presence of amyloidosis and other comorbidities across the groups; however, we expect this misclassification (e.g. classifying HF with amyloidosis as HF alone due to the absence of an amyloidosis diagnosis from the discharge records) to bias results toward the null (i.e. no effect). Last, we were unable to study the effect of race or geographic location, as that information is not available in the NRD.

### Timing and co-occurrence of symptoms prior to a diagnosis of light chain (AL) amyloidosis [^114pvxJs]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

Data for this observational retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with AL amyloidosis were drawn from TriNetX. The TriNetX is a health research network providing access to high-quality, de-identified patient-level EHR data from more than 60 U.S. healthcare organizations. The data are deidentified in accordance with the HIPAA de-identifications standards at 45 CFR § 164.514. Data were provided by the Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Research Data Warehouse of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute using Honest Broker tools which allow extraction of curated data in fully de-identified format and therefore do not require Institutional Research Board review.

Cohort identification

As a first step, we selected a cohort of individuals with AL amyloidosis by identifying patients who had at least one inpatient or at least two outpatient visits with an association AL amyloidosis International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code (ICD-9: 277.30, 277.39 or ICD-10: E85.81, E85.4, E85.89, E85.9) during the study period between 10/01/2015–12/31/2020. The date of the earliest of these occurrences was used to indicate the time of the patients' formal AL amyloidosis diagnosis. In order to make the cohort specific to individuals with AL amyloidosis who might have been picked by the amyloidosis unspecified ICD9 code E85.9, we further required patients to have received chemotherapy or autologous BMT within -90 to +365 days of the AL amyloidosis diagnosis for the study. We restricted the sample to individuals for whom there was information on healthcare utilization in TriNetX dating back to at least 3 years from their AL amyloidosis diagnosis date. Our choice of look back period was consistent with the prior literature indicating that nearly 90% of AL amyloidosis patients report initial symptoms within 3 years and 80% within 2 years of their AL amyloidosis diagnosis.

Variable definitions

The precursor conditions of interest, along with their ICD codes, are listed in Table 1. These were categorized by organ system as clonal, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, multisystemic, and neurologic, with a residual category of miscellaneous. Time from precursor condition to AL diagnosis was calculated based on the date of the earliest medical encounter with a code for the specific precursor diagnosis to the date of AL amyloidosis diagnosis.

### Diagnostic pathways, cardiac manifestations and outcomes in light chain amyloidosis: analysis of a US claims database [^113vaRmQ]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and data source

In this retrospective cohort study, we included data extracted from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus US claims database from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2022, for adults (age ≥ 18 years) with at least 2 diagnoses of AL amyloidosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10): E85.81). IQVIA PharMetrics Plus is a health plan claims database consisting of adjudicated claims for more than 210 million enrolees in the USA since 2006. This database contains information on procedures, inpatient (IP) and outpatient diagnoses, retail and mail order prescription medications, provider specialty, and place of service (POS). All data are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant to protect patient privacy. The index date was the date of the first diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. We analysed data collected during the baseline period of 24 months (730 days) prior to diagnosis and the follow-up period of 6 months (180 days) after diagnosis.

Patients

Our study included patients with at least 2 diagnoses of AL amyloidosis during the identification period of 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2022; age ≥ 18 years at diagnosis; treatment naive prior to diagnosis; and with at least 24 months continuous coverage before diagnosis, at least 6 months follow-up, and treated within 6 months of diagnosis (figure 1). We excluded patients with missing and/or masked age or sex data or diagnosed with transthyretin amyloidosis.

### Genomic screening for pathogenic transthyretin variants finds evidence of underdiagnosed amyloid cardiomyopathy from health records [^112Mi1Ma]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Phenotype evaluation

We collected available demographic (date of birth, sex, age at last encounter, and vital status), diagnostic (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9th or ICD-10th Revision codes from clinical encounters and patient problem lists), and clinical findings from the most recent echocardiogram, as available as of February 2020. Analysis was restricted to individuals with at least 4 weeks of longitudinal follow-up between their first and last encounters in the EHR (N = 134,753).

Cardiac amyloidosis was defined using diagnoses of "amyloid heart disease (hierarchical condition categories [HCC])", "cardiac amyloidosis (HCC)", and "restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis (HCC)". General (noncardiac-specific) amyloidosis diagnoses (inclusive of amyloid neuropathy) were defined based on E85 ICD-10 codes (Supplemental Table 1). Other prespecified cardiac (cardiomyopathy [specifically nonischemic etiology and excluding dilated presentation], heart failure, atrial fibrillation, aortic valve stenosis, atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, and sick sinus syndrome), peripheral neuropathy (carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis, limb mononeuropathy, unspecified mononeuropathy, or polyneuropathy), autonomic neuropathy (autonomic dysfunction, incontinence, or impotence), ophthalmological (cataracts or glaucoma), or miscellaneous (hepatomegaly) phenotypes of interest were defined using diagnosis codes or custom definitions, as detailed in Supplemental Table 1. Diagnoses were considered valid if the specified codes were used on 2 or more clinical encounters or listed as active on the patient's problem list. Other diagnostic findings of interest included left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, LV cavity size, or ejection fraction from the most recent echocardiography exam.

Cardiac amyloidosis — arrhythmia management is summarized with Class/Level-tagged directives and cohort outcomes as follows: IIb C-EO In individuals with cardiac amyloidosis and symptomatic atrial arrhythmias, the use of sotalol, dofetilide, or amiodarone may be considered. IIb B-NR In individuals with AL-type cardiac amyloidosis with nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias, a prophylactic ICD may be considered if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected. IIb C-LD In individuals with cardiac amyloidosis and symptomatic atrial arrhythmias, cardiac ablation may be considered. Supporting cohort data note: In a cohort of 26 patients, 13 of whom underwent catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmia, the 1- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was 70% and 60%, respectively; the remaining 13 patients underwent AV node ablation, and 11 patients died during the study period.

### Nationwide prevalence and characteristics of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in Sweden [^111R4Xs4]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First and most importantly, only diagnosed ATTR-CM cases could be identified in this study and underdiagnosis is frequent. Patients diagnosed with ATTR-CM were identified based on a combination of several ICD-10 codes since there is no final consensus on how to code the diagnoses of ATTRv-CM and ATTRwt-CM in Sweden. Some patients diagnosed with ATTR-CM may have been missed by the identification algorithm and some patients may have been falsely included. In addition, this study could not differentiate patients with and without biopsy-proven or otherwise clinically validated ATTR-CM diagnoses and it was not possible to differentiate ATTRv-CM and ATTRwt-CM cases. This is an important limitation as clinical presentations and prognoses differ between ATTRwt-CM and types of ATTRv-CM. Finally, the exact date of the first ATTR-CM diagnosis was not known but was set to the first HF or CM diagnosis which fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

Despite these limitations, the carefully designed algorithm used to identify probable patients with ATTR-CM, and exclude patients with AL, was demonstrated by study results to work well. Prevalence rates, patient characteristics and mortality were in line with the existing literature. The higher prevalence rates found in Northern Sweden reflect the larger numbers of hereditary cases as well as the increased disease awareness of physicians in these regions, further increasing confidence in the method of patient identification used in this study. Moreover, the high-quality national health registers provide a reliant data source to study epidemiology and facilitated estimation of prevalence for the whole country without the need to extrapolate. Finally, the long follow-up period of up to 11 years leads to mature survival data and the long look-back period of a minimum of 10 years made it possible to study red flags that occurred several years before ATTR-CM diagnosis.

In conclusion, this study provides the first nationwide estimates of ATTR-CM prevalence and risk factors. The prevalence of diagnosed ATTR-CM cases increased over time and the median survival from ATTR-CM diagnosis was just over 3 years. This study revealed worse survival outcomes for women compared with men. The results reinforce the severity of the disease, high mortality and the importance of earlier diagnosis in order to effectively treat patients and prevent disease progression. This study provided supporting evidence about the importance of red flags and their potential in facilitating early diagnosis.

### Amyloidosis and 30-day outcomes among patients with heart Failure: a nationwide readmissions database study [^111rS4AV]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

Hospitalizations for HF were identified using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). The NRD is a constituent of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project family of health care databases developed through a federal-state-industry partnership and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The NRD is an all-payer database that includes over 15 million discharges from 22 states and accounts for 51% of the total U.S. resident population and 49% of all U.S. hospitalizations. Importantly, the NRD contains verified patient linkage numbers, meaning patients can be tracked across hospitals within a state, each year, allowing capture of in-state readmissions. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project datasets, including the NRD, conform to the definition of a limited dataset and institutional board review is not required.

All hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of HF (International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision-Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 428 to 428.9) between January 1, 2010, and August 31, 2015, and were residents of the state were eligible for inclusion. For the present analysis, only the first HF hospitalization event for a particular patient within each year was included. Hospitalizations with discharges in December were excluded, as they were unable to have complete 30-day follow-up, given how the NRD assigns linked patient identification codes; similarly, hospitalizations from September 2015 were not included, as their 30-day follow-up period would include time after October 1, 2015, when ICD-10th Revision-Clinical Modification codes were implemented. Consistent with prior literature, secondary diagnoses for amyloidosis were identified using ICD-9-CM codes 277.3 to 277.39. The ICD-9-CM codes for amyloidosis are not specific to the type of amyloidosis, and the data for the sensitivity and specificity of these codes are not yet available.

### Adverse outcomes in hospitalizations for amyloid-related heart failure [^111osVyT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is being increasingly recognized as an important cause of heart failure (HF). In this study, we looked at adverse outcomes in hospitalizations with amyloid-related HF. This study was a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample data, collected from 2016 to 2019. Patients ≥ 41 years of age and admitted for HF were included in the study. In these hospitalizations, amyloid-related HF was identified through the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for amyloidosis. The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality, whereas secondary outcomes were prolonged length of stay, mechanical ventilation, mechanical circulatory support, vasopressors use, and dispositions other than home. From 2016 to 2019, there were 4,705,274 HF hospitalizations, of which 16,955 (0.4%) had amyloid cardiomyopathy. In all HF hospitalizations, amyloid-related increased from 0.26% in 2016 to 0.46% in 2019 (relative increase, 76.9%, P for trend < 0.001). Amyloid-related HF hospitalizations were more common in older, male, and Black patients. The odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11 to 1.38), prolonged hospital length (OR, 1.61; 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.73) and vasopressors use (OR, 1.59; 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.05) were significantly higher for amyloid-related hospitalizations. Amyloid-related HF hospitalizations are increasing substantially and are associated with adverse hospital outcomes. These hospitalizations were disproportionately higher for older, male, and Black patients. Amyloid-related HF is rare and underdiagnosed yet has several adverse outcomes. Hence, healthcare providers should be watchful of this condition for early identification and prompt management.

### Geographic disparities in reported US amyloidosis mortality from 1979 to 2015: potential underdetection of cardiac amyloidosis [^111cyvYM]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cardiac amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed disease and is highly fatal when untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment with the emerging novel therapies significantly improve survival. A comprehensive analysis of amyloidosis-related mortality is critical to appreciate the nature and distribution of underdiagnosis and improve disease detection.

Objective

To evaluate the temporal and regional trends in age-adjusted amyloidosis-related mortality among men and women of various races/ethnicities in the United States.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this observational cohort study, death certificate information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research database and the National Vital Statistics System from 1979 to 2015 was analyzed. A total of 30 764 individuals in the United States with amyloidosis listed as the underlying cause of death and 26 591 individuals with amyloidosis listed as a contributing cause of death were analyzed.

Exposures

Region of residence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Age-adjusted mortality rate from amyloidosis per 1 000 000 population stratified by year, sex, race/ethnicity, and state and county of residence.

Results

Of the 30 764 individuals with amyloidosis listed as the underlying cause of death, 17 421 (56.6%) were men and 27 312 (88.8%) were 55 years or older. From 1979 to 2015, the reported overall mean age-adjusted mortality rate from amyloidosis as the underlying cause of death doubled from 1.77 to 3.96 per 1 000 000 population (2.32 to 5.43 in men and 1.35 to 2.80 in women). Black men had the highest mortality rate (12.36 per 1 000 000), followed by black women (6.48 per 1 000 000). Amyloidosis contributed to age-adjusted mortality rates as high as 31.73 per 1 000 000 in certain counties. Most southern states reported the lowest US mortality rates despite having the highest proportions of black individuals.

Conclusions and Relevance

The increased reported mortality over time and in proximity to amyloidosis centers more likely reflects an overall increase in disease diagnosis rather than increased lethality. The reported amyloidosis mortality is highly variable in different US regions. The lack of higher reported mortality rates in states with a greater proportion of black residents suggests underdiagnosis of amyloidosis, including cardiac forms of the disease, in many areas of the United States. Better understanding of the determinants of geographic and racial disparity in the reporting of amyloidosis deaths are warranted.

### Cardiovascular morbidity in monoclonal Gammopathy of undetermined significance: a Danish nationwide study [^1138FVzp]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was exempt from ethical board approval, given its registry-based setup where individuals could not be identified. We used the Danish National Patient Registry to capture all diagnoses of MGUS, excluding multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and amyloid disease at baseline, and calculated the prevalence and incidence of a broad range of cardiovascular outcomes. In brief, the Danish National Patient Registry is a comprehensive national database that captures all inpatient and outpatient visits in Denmark (excluding primary care visits). Starting in 1978, every time a patient had a health care encounter, their primary and secondary diagnoses are recorded in the registry in association with the patient's social security number. This is done using International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding (using ICD-8 from 1978 to 1993 and then using ICD-10 from 1994 onward), and data to anonymously link exposures and outcomes are accessible across institutions within Denmark. In addition, since 1995, all medications are registered using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification codes that can be linked with ICD diagnoses for research purposes. Full diagnostic codes for outcomes and comorbidities, as well as medication use are available in Supplemental Table 1. To meet the study's inclusion criteria, all patients needed a diagnosis of MGUS (ICD-10 code D472) between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2018. All cases with a concomitant or prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma (ICD-10 code C90), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ICD-10 C85), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and other B-cell lymphomas (ICD-10 C88), or amyloidosis (ICD-10 E85) were excluded. The positive predictive value of MGUS using this algorithm was estimated to be 88%. Endpoints included heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, ischemic stroke, conduction disease (including atrioventricular block or left bundle branch block), pericarditis, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, cor pulmonale, venous thromboembolism, and pacemaker/implantable cardiac defibrillator implementation. We only considered diagnoses that required hospitalization or outpatient visits, thus excluding emergency room diagnoses, which have been shown to be less valid. The majority of the studied cardiovascular endpoints have been validated with excellent positive predictive values. We also studied the risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (defined as any cardiovascular diagnosis (ICD-10 I00-I99) registered as a main or contributing cause of death in the national Causes of Death registry). Comorbidities were defined using ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes, as specified in Supplemental Table 1. However, because diabetes and hypertension are most often treated in a primary care setting, we used claimed prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs as a proxy for diabetes, and prescriptions of at least 2 classes of antihypertensive medications as a proxy for hypertension (this algorithm was used and validated in prior work).

### The impact of diagnostic code and inclusion period on clinical outcomes in ATTR cardiomyopathy [^116Vo2DZ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the study by Jaiswal et al, which found that the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) was associated with prognostic benefits in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Given the uncertain efficacy of conventional guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure (HF), we commend the authors for their important contribution to advancing the field. While these findings are compelling, several methodological aspects of the study merit further discussions before drawing conclusions around SGLT2i use in ATTR-CM.

First, the reliance of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision-Clinical Modification code of E85.4 (organ-limited amyloidosis) to define ATTR-CM may introduce significant misclassification. This code encompasses amyloidosis involving various organs beyond the heart, including the kidneys, liver, and spleen. More importantly, this is not specific to transthyretin amyloidosis, potentially allowing the inclusion of patients with light-chain amyloidosis, which has distinct pathophysiology and treatment implications. The inclusion of non-ATTR-CM patients could have diluted or confounded the observed treatment effect of SGLT2i, limiting the generalization of the findings to the ATTR-CM population. Second, the study inclusion period (2000–2023) may have led to temporal bias. SGLT2i were approved in 2013, meaning the non-SGLT2i group included patients from 2000 to 2023, while all SGLT2i users were necessarily included after 2013. This imbalance is clinical relevance in ATTR-CM as the diagnostic timeline from HF symptom onset to ATTR-CM diagnosis, a well-recognized prognostic factor in ATTR-CM, has significantly shortened over this period, from a median of 3 years at early 2000 to 1 year after 2012. Additionally, HF management guidelines have evolved considerably over this time frame. The discrepancy in inclusion periods between the 2 groups may have contributed to selection bias, affecting the precision of the reported treatment effect of SGLT2i in ATTR-CM.

In summary, while this observational study offers intriguing insights, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the potential biases introduced by the study design.

Methods

Data Source

Data were drawn from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The NIS is a publicly available database created by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and has been previously well‐described. The NIS (from 2012 onwards) represents a cross‐sectional 20% stratified sample of discharges from all participating US community hospitals, excluding rehabilitation and long‐term acute care hospitals. Due to the change from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) to Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, to minimize the effect of coding variations in prior data sets, data from the fourth quarter of 2015 through 2019 were included. Because the NIS includes deidentified data, this study was deemed exempt from review by our institutional Review board and informed consent was not required. Although our analytic material is available on request for the purpose of reproducibility and transparency, the data sets are accessible only via AHRQ. This study was guided by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (checklist).

### Prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in patients undergoing echocardiography at a tertiary center [^114iDqND]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with echocardiographic features of CA with inconclusive or unpursued confirmatory testing were defined as "possible CA".

We calculated the prevalence of CA by dividing the total number of definite cases by the total number of patients within the cohort and reported the associated 95% exact binomial CIs. We stratified the prevalence of definite and possible CA by age group. Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4.

Both ICD codes and echocardiogram reports suggested CA in 376 patients with 280 (74%) adjudicated as definite and 58 (15%) as possible CA. Another 548 patients had an ICD code, although no echocardiogram report suggesting CA with 107 (20%) adjudicated as definite and 74 (14%) as possible CA. Echocardiographic impressions of CA without an ICD code were present in 75 with 1 (1%) adjudicated as definite and 33 (44%) as possible CA.

Of 31,027 patients (age 64 ± 16 years, 56% male), 388 (1.25%; 95% CI: 1.13–1.38) had a diagnosis of CA; 146 (0.47%; 95% CI: 0.40–0.55) and 237 (0.76%; 95% CI: 0.67–0.87) of these patients had diagnoses of AL and ATTR CA, respectively (Figure 1). Additional subtypes of CA included 1 patient with AA (inflammatory), 2 patients with apolipoprotein A, 1 patient with coexisting AL and ATTR, and 1 patient with unidentified CA. Possible CA was present in 165 (0.53%; 95% CI: 0.45–0.62) patients.

### Association between carpal tunnel syndrome and subsequent heart failure among adults in Germany [^1174W4Nu]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that CTS was significantly associated with an increased incidence of new-onset HF. The increased rate of HF among patients with CTS requires attention because HF is a common disease associated with high mortality. Early diagnosis of HF is a key to successful treatment, particularly for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, which has been associated with CTS in a recent study. The importance of cardiac amyloidosis for HF with preserved ejection fraction has been demonstrated.

Our study has some limitations. Data are based on ICD-10 codes only. The absolute number of patients with amyloidosis recorded in our study is relatively small, there is uncertainty about the proportion of patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, and underrecording is suspected. Because our database does not offer data on the severity of cardiovascular disease, we cannot ensure that both groups are balanced in this regard.

However, our study reveals an association between CTS and HF. Thus, we point to a new role for surgeons together with general practitioners in the early detection of important internal diseases, a chance for better treatment, and an improved prognosis of these diseases.

### Noncardiac manifestations of hereditary amyloidosis [^115bEZwo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The most common forms of cardiac amyloidosis are progressive, life threatening, and underrecognized. Symptoms affect a variety of organs and overlap with those of more common conditions, complicating and postponing diagnosis. Cardiac disease generally determines mortality, but noncardiac manifestations typically surface before cardiac symptoms, often several years before diagnosis. Familiarity with noncardiac manifestations may lead to early diagnosis, enabling treatment and improving prognosis.

### Moving towards establishing centres of excellence in cardiac amyloidosis: an International Cardio-oncology Society statement [^113yrAac]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of amyloidosis has been increasing, driven by a combination of improved awareness, evolution of diagnostic pathways, and effective treatment options for both transthyretin and light chain amyloidosis. Due to the complexity of amyloidosis, centralised expert providers with experience in delineating the nuances of confirmatory diagnosis and management may be beneficial. There are many potential benefits of a centre of excellence designation for the treatment of amyloidosis including recognition of institutions that have been leading the way for the optimal treatment of this condition, establishing the expectations for any centre who is engaging in the treatment of amyloidosis and developing cooperative groups to allow more effective research in this disease space. Standardising the expectations and criteria for these centres is essential for ensuring the highest quality of clinical care and community education. In order to define what components are necessary for an effective centre of excellence for the treatment of amyloidosis, we prepared a survey in cooperation with a multidisciplinary panel of amyloidosis experts representing an international consortium. The purpose of this position statement is to identify the essential elements necessary for highly effective clinical care and to develop a general standard with which practices or institutions could be recognised as a centre of excellence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis. A position statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases [^112RiNUG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a serious and progressive infiltrative disease that is caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils at the cardiac level. It can be due to rare genetic variants in the hereditary forms or as a consequence of acquired conditions. Thanks to advances in imaging techniques and the possibility of achieving a non-invasive diagnosis, we now know that cardiac amyloidosis is a more frequent disease than traditionally considered. In this position paper the Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Disease proposes an invasive and non-invasive definition of cardiac amyloidosis, addresses clinical scenarios and situations to suspect the condition and proposes a diagnostic algorithm to aid diagnosis. Furthermore, we also review how to monitor and treat cardiac amyloidosis, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the latest advances in the field and clinical practice.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Other infiltrative cardiomyopathies — ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and device considerations: Infiltrative cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of uncommon systemic diseases with associated cardiac involvement; in some infiltrative cardiomyopathies, such as hemochromatosis, VAs are uncommon, and some, such as hemochromatosis, are highly treatable especially when diagnosed early. In all cases, treatment of the underlying condition must accompany management of cardiac arrhythmias, and, in general, unless contraindications are present, VAs should be treated as in any other cardiomyopathy. For cardiac amyloidosis, until recently prognosis was very poor with patients ultimately succumbing to progressive heart failure (HF), but advances in medical therapy for light-chain amyloidosis have led to improved outcomes. Decisions must be individualized because data remain too limited to allow formal recommendations as published reports on ICD effectiveness in amyloidosis are small, observational and with limited follow up, and whether there is greater benefit to ICD placement in light chain amyloidosis versus transthyretin-related amyloidosis remains uncertain.

Study Population and Variables

We identified patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent elective implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation using ICD‐10‐PCS codes: 02HK3KZ, 02HK4KZ, 0JH608Z, 0JH638Z. Patients who received an atrial lead during the procedure (codes: 02H64XZ, 02H63XZ) were also identified.

We used ICD‐10‐CM/PCS codes (provided in detail in Table S1) to identify and exclude patients who had any of the following diagnoses: cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, complete atrioventricular block, second degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, in‐situ cardiac implantable electronic device, or need for a temporary pacemaker.

The following patient demographics were collected from the database: age, sex, and race. ICD‐10‐CM codes (Table S1) were used to identify different comorbidities, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, permanent AF, obesity, and chronic oral anticoagulant use. For the purposes of calculating the Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index, additional comorbidities were identified from the database using ICD‐10‐CM codes. The Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index is a modification of the Charlson comorbidity index, containing 19 comorbidity conditions with differential weights, with a total score ranging from 0 to 38. Detailed information on Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index is provided in Table S2. Higher Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index scores indicate a greater burden of comorbid diseases and are associated with death 1 year after admission. The index has been used extensively in studies from administrative databases, with proved validity in predicting short‐ and long‐term outcomes.

Potential etiologies of cardiomyopathy were identified using the following ICD‐10‐CM codes: ischemic cardiomyopathy, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, cardiac amyloidosis, and myocarditis.

The primary outcome in this study was in‐hospital complications including death as well as LOS and total charges. Using the ICD‐10‐CM/PCS codes (Table S1) the following in‐hospital complications were identified: hemopericardium, tamponade, acute pericarditis, pneumothorax/hemothorax, chest tube insertion, postoperative respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pocket hematoma, lead dislodgement, postprocedural fever, infection following procedure, and acute access deep vein thrombosis.

Cardiac amyloidosis risk models

We compared the performance of 4 risk models with different inputs and model architectures (Table 1). The Huda et almodel was developed to predict risk of wild-type ATTR-CM using databases of claims data and was validated on claims data and electronic health record (EHR) data from patients with ICD codes for amyloidosis (including for codes beyond the specific code for wild-type ATTR). The Huda et al model uses tabular, ICD code data in a random forest model. The Mayo ATTR-CM Score was developed by Davies et aland uses tabular data that include demographics (age, sex), history of hypertension (based on ICD codes for this analysis), and TTE measurements (LVEF, wall thickness). The Mayo ATTR-CM Score is an integer-based score created from a linear regression model. Duffy et aldeveloped the EchoNet-LVH model, which is a computer vision model that uses a convolutional neural network architecture. EchoNet-LVH generates a prediction for likelihood of cardiac amyloidosis (any type) from an echocardiogram study synthesizing information about wall thickness from the parasternal long axis view and additional information from the apical 4-chamber view. Lastly, EchoGo Amyloidosis is another deep learning classifier developed by Ultromics which was trained to predict a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis from a single apical 4-chamber view video clip and received Food and Drug Administration clearance for commercial use in November 2024. EchoGo Amyloidosis produces a probability score (0–1) and an uncertainty score. If EchoGo Amyloidosis generated a probability score for multiple apical 4-chamber clips within an echo study, the least uncertain score was used.

One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Coexisting calcific aortic stenosis and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis: real-world evaluation of clinical characteristics and outcomes [^1111fzYB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Cohorts

Three cohorts of patients were created on the basis of ICD‐10‐CM codes: AS‐only, ATTR‐CA–only, and AS–plus–ATTR‐CA cohorts. All patients were aged ≥ 60 years when the first diagnosis code for AS or ATTR‐CA was recorded and were continuously enrolled in a medical plan for ≥ 6 months after the code was recorded. The AS‐only cohort included patients who had ≥ 1 claim for AS (I35.0 or I35.2), excluding those with congenital, bicuspid, or rheumatic AS. The ATTR‐CA–only cohort included patients who had ≥ 1 claim for cardiac amyloidosis (CA; E85), excluding those with evidence of light‐chain amyloidosis on the basis of diagnosis codes for the condition (E85.81); liver, heart, or stem cell transplant; multiple myeloma; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; or prescription claims for related treatment. Inclusion in the AS–plus–ATTR‐CA cohort required that patients have ≥ 1 AS claim and ≥ 1 CA claim or ≥ 1 prescription claim for tafamidis, inotersen, or patisiran.

AS severity is not captured in claims data via ICD‐10‐CM codes; as a result, ad hoc analyses were conducted in a subgroup of patients with procedural codes for AVR at the time of first AS or CA diagnosis. AVR documentation was considered a surrogate marker of severe AS. Patients who had AVR were also categorized into AS‐only and AS–plus–ATTR‐CA cohorts.

- HFpEF, particularly in men

- intolerance to ACE inhibitors or β-blockers

- bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome

- lumbar spinal stenosis

- biceps tendon rupture

- unexplained peripheral neuropathy (e.g., loss of warm/cold discrimination), particularly if associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g., postural hypotension, alternating bowel pattern)

- unexplained atrial arrhythmias or conduction system disease/need for a pacemaker.

Cardiac amyloidosis — definitions and HF phenotype thresholds — refers to a restrictive cardiomyopathy from amyloid fibril deposition, with the 2 most common types being AL amyloidosis (monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains) and ATTR amyloidosis (transthyretin, variant or wild-type TTR). GDMT denotes guideline-directed medical therapy. HF categories are defined as follows: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction requires left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40%, heart failure with mildly reduced EF requires left ventricular EF 41% to 49%, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction requires left ventricular EF ≥ 50%. The monoclonal protein screen includes serum kappa and lambda free light chains and serum immunofixation electrophoresis.

### A machine learning model for identifying patients at risk for wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111ifz6J]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Model validation

The model derived from the IQVIA wild-type ATTR-CM population (Cohort 1) was validated in three other cohorts (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4, described in Supplementary Table 5) to evaluate its generalizability to a broader group of populations. We again computed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy.

To further examine clinical generalizability of the ML model, we performed additional external testing of the derived and validated wild-type ATTR-CM Random Forest machine learning model in the NMEDW EHR cohort. Use of the NMEDW dataset was approved by the Northwestern University IRB. Waiver of informed consent was granted under Northwestern University's IRB regulations, as this was a chart review analysis. The use of NMEDW patient data (model validation portion of the study) was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The NMEDW dataset was queried for all patients with any ICD-9 or ICD-10 HF diagnosis code using a date range of 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2019. Only patients aged ≥ 50 years were included. Cases were patients with an organ-limited amyloidosis code (E85.4) plus a HF diagnosis code but not blood cancer, light chain amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or intracranial hemorrhage diagnoses. Non-amyloid HF controls were patients with a HF code but none of the amyloidosis codes. These were the same definitions used in Cohorts 3 and 4, with the exception that there was no matching of cases and controls (all non-amyloid HF patients were included in the analysis to mimic clinical application of the ML algorithm). Supplementary Fig. 1 displays a flowchart detailing the inclusion/exclusion criteria for cases and controls. The Random Forest model was then applied to the NMEDW cohort and the probability of wild-type ATTR-CM was calculated for each patient. For all patients in the NMEDW HF cohort, we constructed 2 × 2 tables to determine true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy. We also generated ROC curves for the performance of the Random Forest model in the NMEDW HF cohort (age ≥ 50 years) and we computed AUROC for these curves and compared them to additional models (age, age + sex, age + sex + race, age + sex + race + logBNP, age + sex + race + logBNP + abnormal troponin-I (> 0.04 ng/ml), age + sex + race + Random Forest model, and age + sex + race + Random Forest model + total number of encounters).

Discussion — diagnostic evolution and implications in cardiac amyloidosis — As recently as 10 to 15 years ago cardiac amyloidosis was not routinely considered as a diagnosis to explain the etiology of heart failure (HF); the advent of an accurate, noninvasive imaging means to diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis facilitated enhanced recognition of ATTR amyloidosis and its prevalence among patients with HFpEF and AS, and testing for ATTR amyloidosis has identified unrecognized cases of AL amyloidosis. Development of effective therapies to improve survival in patients with both AL and ATTR amyloidosis makes understanding diagnosis and management paramount, and the document emphasizes that the disease is more common than previously thought, has multisystem manifestations requiring appropriate referral to skilled subspecialists, and that although noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis appears potentially straightforward, diagnostic pitfalls may result in misdiagnosis with catastrophic consequences.

Cardiac amyloidosis — nomenclature, types, and transthyretin (TTR) variants: Systemic amyloidosis naming uses "A" plus the misfolded protein, and most amyloid cardiomyopathy (CM) arises from light chain or TTR misfolding, termed AL-CM and ATTR-CM. In ATTR-CM, misfolding occurs with wild-type protein (ATTRwt-CM) or with substitution/deletion mutations (ATTRv-CM). Autopsy series of patients over 80 years of age indicate that 25% harbor TTR amyloid deposits. There are over 130 known TTR variants; Val122Ile is most common in the United States, with a prevalence of 3.5% in the self-identified U.S. Black population, corresponding to approximately 1.5 million carriers.

AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis — epidemiology and diagnostic advances: AL amyloidosis is estimated to have an annual incidence of 1 in 75,000 to 100,000 and a prevalence of 1 in 25,000, and approximately 75% of patients with AL have some degree of cardiac involvement. Observational studies indicate that ATTR-CM may be under-recognized in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure (HF). Imaging techniques and monoclonal light chain testing now allow for accurate noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM in the proper clinical context without the need for confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies, and timely diagnosis will allow prompt implementation of therapeutic interventions that may improve survival, physical function, and/or quality of life.

### Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin protein: a review [^111SogJ5]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cardiac amyloidosis:

- **Definition**: Cardiac amyloidosis refers to infiltration of the heart muscle by amyloid proteins, resulting in cardiomyopathy.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by extracellular accumulation of misfolded protein fragments (immunoglobulin light-chain and transthyretin protein) in the heart muscle.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are related to the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy and include angina, myocardial infarction, and HF. An increased risk of thromboembolic complications is also present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Unadjusted 5-year mortality rates are estimated at 65% in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis and 44% in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

### Nationwide prevalence and characteristics of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in Sweden [^116NSBXr]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Identification of the ATTR-CM cohort

From the study population, patients with ATTR-CM were identified. Patients with ATTR-CM were defined as individuals diagnosed with HF or CM and AM between 2008 and 2018. It was required that the HF/CM diagnosis and the AM diagnosis be not more than 2 years apart.

Several criteria were used to exclude patients with light-chain (AL) amyloidosis from this cohort, in addition to exclusion based on the AL diagnosis code (ICD-10 code: E85.8A), which was introduced in Sweden only in 2014 and is not always used. Based on the association of AL amyloidosis with multiple myeloma (MM), patients with MM diagnosis, patients with prescriptions of drugs commonly used in AL amyloidosis or MM treatment, and patients with haematopoietic stem cell transplant were also excluded. Moreover, patients with more than two AM diagnoses from the haematology department were defined as patients with AL amyloidosis and were excluded. In addition to patients with AL amyloidosis, individuals with a liver or heart transplant prior to diagnosis were excluded, as these are disease-modifying therapies.

The date of inclusion in the ATTR-CM cohort, the index date, was the date of the CM/HF diagnosis used for identification. This date served as proxy for the patient's first ATTR-CM diagnosis and is referred to as the time of ATTR-CM diagnosis throughout the text.

HF comparison cohort

Patients with an HF diagnosis and not included in the ATTR-CM cohort were matched to patients in the ATTR-CM cohort. Patients were matched one-to-one, with replacement, on birth year, sex and the calendar year of diagnosis. The diagnosis date for patients in the matched HF cohort was the date of the first recorded HF diagnosis between 2008 and 2018.

### Prevalence, cardiac phenotype, and outcomes of transthyretin variants in the UK biobank population [^1112FMgg]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The population prevalence of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) caused by pathogenic variation in the TTR gene (vATTR) is unknown.

Objective

To estimate the population prevalence of disease-causing TTR variants and evaluate associated phenotypes and outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) participants with whole-exome sequencing, electrocardiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance data. Participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010, with a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 11–13) years (cutoff date for the analysis, March 12, 2024). Sixty-two candidate TTR variants were extracted based on rarity (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.0001) and/or previously described associations with amyloidosis if more frequent.

Exposure

Carrier status for TTR variants.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Associations of TTR carrier status with vATTR prevalence and cardiovascular imaging and electrocardiogram traits were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between TTR carrier status and atrial fibrillation, conduction disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality were evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Genotypic and diagnostic concordance was examined using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes from the hospital record.

Results

The overall cohort included 469 789 UKB participants (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 54.2% female and 45.8% male). A likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) TTR variant was detected in 473 (0.1%) participants, with Val142Ile being the most prevalent (367 [77.6%]); 91 individuals (0.02%) were carriers of a variant of unknown significance. The overall prevalence of LP/P variants was 0.02% (105 of 444 243) in participants with European ancestry and 4.3% (321 of 7533) in participants with African ancestry. The LP/P variants were associated with higher left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (β = 4.66; 95% CI, 1.87–7.44), and Val142Ile was associated with a longer PR interval (β = 18.34; 95% CI, 5.41–31.27). The LP/P carrier status was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.75–4.12) and conduction disease (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25–2.83). Higher all-cause mortality risk was observed for non-Val142Ile LP/P variants (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06–3.67). Thirteen participants (2.8%) with LP/P variants had diagnostic codes compatible with cardiac or neurologic amyloidosis. Variants of unknown significance were not associated with outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that approximately 1 in 1000 UKB participants were LP/P TTR variant carriers, exceeding previously reported prevalence. The findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing vATTR and associated poor outcomes.

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) genetic testing — indications and panel scope — is described as follows: Genetic testing for suspected ATTR amyloidosis is indicated in individuals with clinical evidence to support a transthyretin (TTR)-related phenotype, and for a specific condition is only recommended for individuals who have a phenotype established to have a genetic basis; the gene panel is recommended to be constrained to those genes that have a known association with the condition under evaluation. This approach is supported because the probability of finding a relevant disease-associated variant is much higher in those with the phenotype and mitigates concerns about undue numbers of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). ATTR is noted as an autosomal-dominant disease where only 1 copy of the variant is needed to cause disease, and the initially identified family member is known as the proband (or index patient).

Cardiac amyloidosis — role of biopsy in diagnosis: In patients with suspected AL amyloidosis, standard evaluation includes tissue biopsy to demonstrate the presence and type of amyloid, and if extracardiac biopsy has proven AL with imaging features consistent with cardiac amyloidosis, endomyocardial biopsy is not typically pursued, though cardiac biopsy is appropriate if concomitant AL/ATTR is suspected. Biopsy site choice matters: abdominal fat pad biopsy has varying sensitivity of 84% for AL-CM, 45% for ATTRv-CM, and 15% for ATTRwt-CM, so a negative fat pad biopsy excludes neither AL-CM nor ATTR-CM and organ biopsy is often needed. For typing, mass spectrometry–based analysis using LC-MS/MS is the gold standard for tissue diagnosis, with a reported sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96%.

Results

There were 1,593,360 HF hospitalizations between 2010 and 2015 that met inclusion criteria, of which 2,846 (0.18%) had a secondary diagnosis of amyloidosis (Central Illustration). This approximated closely to the prevalence of coexisting diagnosis of amyloidosis and HF without respect to the position of these diagnoses in the cohort (0.15%). Baseline characteristics of all HF hospitalizations stratified by the secondary diagnosis of amyloidosis are described in Table 1. Of those, 2,834 (> 99%) hospitalizations matched with at least 1 HF hospitalization on discharge quarter, exact age, sex, and exact CCI (median 143 [interquartile range: 1 to 2,563] matches). The 12 hospitalizations with amyloidosis that did not match were either for relatively young patients (< 25 years of age) or had high CCIs (range 6 to 12); however, after expanding matching criteria to age ± 2 years and CCI ± 1 point for those patients, all were able to be matched (median 7 [interquartile range: 2 to 31] matches).

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.
