## Question

What are concussion symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about concussion symptoms, organized by domain, time course, subtypes, special populations, and red flags. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology to anchor what symptoms reflect. Then, I should categorize symptoms into validated clinical domains. Next, I will map the typical time course and evolution of symptoms. After that, I will review evidence-based subtypes and their prevalence. I will then consider special populations, including pediatrics and non-sport contexts. Finally, I should identify red flags, outline assessment tools, and synthesize key principles for diagnosis and management, making sure to double-check any claims against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't misattribute symptoms. Concussion is a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function, a subset of mild traumatic brain injury, with acute clinical manifestations reflecting a functional disturbance rather than structural injury, and standard neuroimaging is typically normal, which explains why symptoms are often nonspecific and multifaceted [^115oKtGp] [^113raXLS].

> I will now examine the symptom domains to ensure I'm not missing a category. Contemporary frameworks consistently organize symptoms into five domains: physical/somatic, cognitive, emotional/behavioral, sleep, and ocular-motor/vestibular, and I should confirm that these align with consensus statements and systematic reviews before proceeding [^114A8BKF] [^113msbpi] [^117UvrEs].

> Next, I should review the physical/somatic domain carefully. Common symptoms include headache, dizziness and balance problems, nausea or vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred or double vision, photophobia and phonophobia, fatigue or low energy, and a general sense of feeling slowed down or "off", and I need to ensure I note that headache is the most frequent symptom across settings [^112VqMDY] [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].

> Hold on, let me verify the cognitive domain so I don't overgeneralize. Patients frequently report attention and concentration problems, mental fogginess or feeling slowed, memory difficulties for recent or remote events, and trouble thinking clearly, and these cognitive complaints often co-occur with physical and emotional symptoms rather than appearing in isolation [^112VqMDY] [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].

> I need to check the emotional/behavioral domain next. Irritability, anxiety or nervousness, sadness or depressive symptoms, and emotional lability are commonly reported, and I should confirm that persistent affective symptoms warrant screening for primary mental health conditions because they can perpetuate recovery delays if unaddressed [^116tp2C6] [^111yGzZz] [^1136pCy9].

> Let me consider the sleep domain and make sure I capture both ends of the spectrum. Insomnia or trouble falling asleep, hypersomnia or sleeping more than usual, and nonrestorative sleep are typical, and I should double-check that sleep disturbance is also treated as an associated condition that can amplify other symptom clusters and delay recovery if not targeted [^116tp2C6] [^113msbpi] [^114A8BKF].

> I will now examine the ocular-motor/vestibular domain, since it's often underrecognized. Difficulty with smooth pursuit and saccades, convergence insufficiency, accommodative problems, and vestibulo-ocular dysfunction can manifest as reading difficulty, blurred vision, focusing problems, and eye strain, and I should confirm that these features predict slower recovery in youth and merit targeted vestibular and vision rehabilitation when present [^114RDAk9] [^113msbpi] [^114A8BKF].

> Next, I should review the time course and evolution so I don't imply uniformity where there is variability. Symptoms typically emerge immediately or within minutes to hours, peak in severity over the first 24–48 hours, and then gradually improve over days to weeks; however, some symptoms may be delayed or evolve, and a substantial minority experience persistent symptoms beyond the expected window, especially in children and those with higher acute symptom burden [^114dnxJa] [^113TcRkS] [^112NBm1h].

> Wait, let me verify the expected recovery windows before I overstate them. Most adults recover within about 1–2 weeks, whereas children and adolescents often require up to 3–4 weeks, and persistent postconcussive symptoms are commonly defined as symptoms beyond 2 weeks in adults and beyond 4 weeks in children, with 10–15% of cases persisting beyond a month in some cohorts, particularly in pediatric populations [^112NBm1h] [^113TcRkS] [^111Phqtq].

> I should confirm the evidence-based subtypes and their prevalence to guide targeted care. Five predominant subtypes are consistently described: cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood, with sleep disturbance and cervical strain as associated conditions; meta-analytic data suggest headache/migraine and cognitive subtypes are most prevalent acutely, with vestibular symptoms also common in pediatrics, and adults showing relatively higher burdens of cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes compared with controls [^114A8BKF] [^113msbpi] [^115eiyVP].

> But wait, what if the patient is a young child or a nonathlete; I need to ensure I adapt the symptom framing. In preschool children, nonspecific behavioral changes, eating and sleeping disturbances, and regression may predominate, and in older children and adolescents, cognitive and emotional symptoms increasingly emerge; in non-sport populations such as military, domestic violence, and elderly falls, neuropsychiatric sequelae may be underrecognized, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and screen broadly for mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders [^112oXL93] [^116rC5SN] [^1136pCy9].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and danger signs so I don't miss structural injury. Worsening headache, repeated vomiting, seizures, slurred speech, focal weakness or numbness, unsteady gait, confusion or agitation, pupillary asymmetry, inability to recognize people or places, and inability to awaken are indications for urgent emergency evaluation, and I need to ensure caregivers receive written guidance on these warning signs at discharge [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY] [^115JFuxn].

> Next, I should review assessment tools and clinical approach, and I need to be cautious not to overstate diagnostic certainty. Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on history, mechanism, and exam; validated symptom scales such as SCAT5 and Rivermead help quantify burden and track change, neuropsychological testing can assist with persistent or complicated cases, and targeted evaluations of cervical, vestibular, ocular-motor, sleep, and mental health domains should be incorporated to match treatments to profiles; imaging is not routinely indicated unless red flags are present [^111RHkro] [^112SaQBK] [^1128Jtkf].

> Let me reconsider the key principles so I don't jump to conclusions. Symptoms are heterogeneous and nonspecific, often overlapping across domains; recovery is variable and best predicted by acute symptom burden; early, graded return to cognitive and physical activity after a brief period of relative rest is favored over strict rest; and persistent symptoms warrant a multidisciplinary, targeted approach addressing identified subtypes and comorbidities, with patient education and expectation-setting to reduce anxiety and maladaptive behaviors [^111xeAyY] [^117GBErY] [^112NBm1h].

> In summary, I should double-check that I've captured the full spectrum succinctly. Concussion symptoms span physical, cognitive, emotional, sleep, and ocular-motor/vestibular domains, typically peak within 24–48 hours, and usually resolve within 1–4 weeks depending on age and context, yet a meaningful minority evolve into persistent symptoms that require subtype-targeted, multidisciplinary care; maintaining vigilance for red flags and using validated tools to track change are essential to safe, effective management [^114dnxJa] [^112NBm1h] [^113TcRkS].

Concussion symptoms are **highly variable** and span physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains [^116tp2C6]. The most common are **headache, dizziness, nausea, balance problems, blurred vision, sensitivity to light or noise, fatigue, confusion, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, irritability, anxiety, sadness, and sleep disturbances** [^114dnxJa] [^116tp2C6]. Symptoms may appear immediately or evolve over hours to days, and most resolve within 1–4 weeks; however, 10–30% persist beyond a month, especially in children and adolescents [^116tp2C6] [^111xeAyY] [^113TcRkS]. Persistent symptoms often reflect overlapping subtypes (cognitive, vestibular, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, anxiety/mood) and require targeted, multidisciplinary management [^114A8BKF] [^112NBm1h].

## Physical symptoms

- **Headache**: Most common symptom, often described as pressure or tightness [^112VqMDY] [^114QzmTY].
- **Dizziness and balance problems**: Frequent and may persist beyond acute phase [^113msbpi] [^113yKmzd].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common acutely, especially in children [^114dnxJa] [^114QzmTY].
- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred or double vision, light sensitivity (photophobia) [^114RDAk9] [^116tp2C6].
- **Fatigue**: Easily tired, low energy, slowed responses [^116tp2C6].
- **Sensitivity to noise**: Auditory hypersensitivity is common [^116tp2C6] [^114dnxJa].

---

- **Anxiety and nervousness**: Heightened worry or restlessness [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Sadness or depression**: Mood changes, tearfulness [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Emotional lability**: Rapid mood swings or exaggerated reactions [^114PVwMu].

---

## Sleep disturbances

Sleep disturbances include **insomnia** — trouble falling or staying asleep — and **hypersomnia**, with excessive sleepiness or longer sleep duration [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY]. Poor sleep quality, including restless or non-restorative sleep, is also common [^116tp2C6] [^113msbpi].

---

## Symptom variability and evolution

Symptoms vary by **individual**, injury, and context; they may appear immediately or evolve over hours to days [^116tp2C6] [^113P7fEV]. Most resolve within 1–4 weeks, but 10–30% persist beyond a month, especially in children and adolescents [^113TcRkS] [^112oXL93].

---

## Symptom subtypes and clinical profiles

Recent frameworks identify **five subtypes** — cognitive, vestibular, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, and anxiety/mood — with sleep and cervical strain as associated conditions [^114A8BKF] [^113msbpi]. These profiles guide targeted management and reflect overlapping symptom clusters [^112NBm1h].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

- **Worsening headache**: Severe, persistent, or escalating [^116tp2C6] [^1141SjLL].
- **Repeated vomiting**: Persistent nausea/vomiting [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Seizures**: Convulsions or seizure activity [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Slurred speech**: Difficulty speaking or understanding speech [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Weakness or numbness**: Focal deficits or coordination loss [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Confusion or agitation**: Severe disorientation or behavioral changes [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].
- **Loss of consciousness**: Brief or prolonged [^116tp2C6] [^114QzmTY].

---

## Persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS)

PPCS are symptoms lasting beyond the expected recovery window (> 2 weeks in adults, > 4 weeks in children) [^112NBm1h] and often reflect **multifactorial drivers**, including pre-existing conditions, psychological factors, and overlapping symptom subtypes [^1142Ay3Z]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, targeting specific deficits (e.g. vestibular therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, psychological support) [^112NBm1h] [^1142Ay3Z].

---

## Conclusion

Concussion symptoms span physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains, with significant individual variability and potential for persistence [^117UvrEs] [^113TcRkS]. Recognizing symptom subtypes and red flags enables **targeted, multidisciplinary care** and improves outcomes [^114A8BKF] [^1142Ay3Z].

### What is the lowest threshold to make a diagnosis of concussion? [^114dnxJa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence for determining the lowest threshold for diagnosing a sport-related concussion.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included sports concussion, concussion assessment, diagnosis, concussion symptoms, onfield assessment and sports-related traumatic brain injury.

Results

The majority of concussions in sport occur without loss of consciousness or frank neurological signs. Some of the hallmark signs of acute concussion include mental confusion, memory and balance disturbance. Over the course of the first 24 h, the most common symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness and balance problems, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, confusion, memory loss and 'fatigue'. Symptoms such as tiredness, irritability, nervousness or anxiety, sleep disturbance and sensitivity to light or noise may be noticed in the days after injury. The pathophysiology of sports concussion remains poorly understood. There appears to be a period of vulnerability following concussion in which an overlapping injury might cause magnified pathophysiology.

Conclusions

Sport-related concussions can be difficult to diagnose. Concussion produces an evolving constellation of somatic, cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms that are typically most severe during the earliest acute postinjury period (ie, within the first 24–48 h) and diminish over a matter of several days to weeks in the majority of athletes. Athletes suspected of concussion should be removed from play and evaluated thoroughly.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^114gkMPC]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

It is time to stop using the term concussion as it has no clear definition and no pathological meaning. This confusion is increasingly problematic as the management of 'concussed' individuals is a pressing concern. Historically, it has been used to describe patients briefly disabled following a head injury, with the assumption that this was due to a transient disorder of brain function without long-term sequelae. However, the symptoms of concussion are highly variable in duration, and can persist for many years with no reliable early predictors of outcome. Using vague terminology for post-traumatic problems leads to misconceptions and biases in the diagnostic process, producing uninterpretable science, poor clinical guidelines and confused policy. We propose that the term concussion should be avoided. Instead neurologists and other healthcare professionals should classify the severity of traumatic brain injury and then attempt to precisely diagnose the underlying cause of post-traumatic symptoms.

Current definitions of concussion

There is still no universal consensus regarding the definition of concussion. The 2012 Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport proposed that concussion and mild TBI should be viewed as distinct entities. The group defined concussion as a "complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain", and allowed for the presence of neuropathological damage. However, concussive symptoms were largely thought to reflect a functional disturbance, typically resolving spontaneously with no imaging abnormality. In contrast, recent American Academy of Neurology guidelines for sports concussion in 2013 do not separate concussion from mild TBI, defining concussion as "a clinical syndrome of biomechanically induced alteration of brain function, typically affecting memory and orientation, which may involve loss of consciousness". However, they noted a lack of consensus in the use of the term, with an overlap in the use of concussion and mild TBI.

Therefore, concussion is currently used in two main ways: (1) to describe a distinct pathophysiological entity with its own diagnostic and management implications, mainly seen in the context of sporting injuries; and (2) to describe a constellation of symptoms that arise after different types of TBI.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: evidence for subtype classification [^111QVuT8]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Concussion Subtype Workgroup and Invited Observers

To define concussion subtypes, experts were identified from: the 2015 "Targeted Evaluation and Active Management" meeting; other concussion-focused meetings; review of relevant literature; and via recommendation from various medical and health organizations. Each workgroup candidate was reviewed for potential invitation to participate. In total, 11 nonfederal members ultimately formed the workgroup and they were required to declare financial and intellectual conflicts of interest. In addition, federal representatives, from the U.S. Department of Defense, the FDA/Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, and the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, as well as organizational representatives from the American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons, National Athletic Trainer's Association, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the Brain Trauma Foundation participated as observers and reviewers to the process and to the final report. The Concussion Subtypes Workgroup was charged with developing subtype-specific definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acknowledging associated data, identifying primary outcomes, linking data elements, advising systematic review of evidence and analysis, developing recommendations, and positing future directions for research.

Derivation of Definitions and Selection of Clinical Questions

Workgroup members convened to identify and establish thematic descriptions of the most common concussion subtypes based upon expert consensus, and identify clinical questions. The following 4 clinical questions are identified:
What is the prevalence of concussion subtypes and associated conditions compared with controls within the first 3 mo postinjury?
What is the severity of symptoms reported compared to control populations?
What is the temporal recovery trajectory by concussion subtype and associated conditions over the first 3 mo postinjury?
How do subtypes cluster?

### The difficult concussion patient: what is the best approach to investigation and management of persistent (> 10 days) postconcussive symptoms? [^1142iYVA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concussion in sport typically recovers clinically within 10 days of injury. In some cases, however, symptoms may be prolonged or complications may develop. The objectives of the current paper are to review the literature regarding the difficult concussion and to provide recommendations for an approach to the investigation and management of patients with persistent symptoms.

Methods

A qualitative review of the literature on concussion in sport was conducted with a focus on prolonged recovery, long-term complications and management including investigation and treatment strategies. MEDLINE and Sports Discus databases were reviewed.

Results

Persistent symptoms (> 10 days) are generally reported in 10–15% of concussions. This figure may be higher in certain sports (eg, ice hockey) and populations (eg, children). In general, symptoms are not specific to concussion and it is important to consider and manage coexistent pathologies. Investigations may include formal neuropsychological testing and conventional neuroimaging to exclude structural pathology. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine clinical use of advanced neuroimaging techniques or genetics markers. Preliminary studies demonstrate the potential benefit of subsymptom threshold activity as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme. Limited research is available on pharmacological interventions.

Conclusions

Cases of concussion in sport where clinical recovery falls outside the expected window (ie, 10 days) should be managed in a multidisciplinary manner by healthcare providers with experience in sports-related concussion. Important components of management, after the initial period of physical and cognitive rest, include associated therapies such as cognitive, vestibular, physical and psychological therapy, assessment for other causes of prolonged symptoms and consideration of a graded exercise programme at a level that does not exacerbate symptoms.

### Heterogeneity of persisting symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC): exploring symptom subtypes and patient subgroups [^111Phqtq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, 50–60 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, among which the majority (60–95%) have mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Sports injuries are among the most common causes (24–29%) of concussion. Although the majority of patients with a concussion recover within 10–14 days, 10–15% of patients suffer from persisting symptoms (i.e. for more than 1 month). Sport-related concussions (SRCs) show great heterogeneity in terms of the emergence, evolution and recovery of symptoms and functional impairments over time. To date, the sources of this variability are largely unknown and a general effective treatment for SRC is missing, which might be due to the heterogenetic nature of SRC. Moreover, prominent differences between patients challenge the development and application of clinical SRC management. Better understanding of the heterogeneity in SRC symptoms could importantly contribute to the development of more targeted and personalized care.

In recent research, the variability in SRC symptomatology has spurred a search into possible symptom subtypes of concussion. Early descriptions of SRC subtypes based on clinical observation have recently been revised into consensus-driven descriptions of symptom subtypes in the acute timeframe after concussion (0–3 days post-injury), for which support was subsequently found in meta-analytic evidence. In a meta-cluster analysis, we recently provided further support for delineation of SRC symptoms into subtypes within the typical course of SRC recovery (within 1 month post-injury). More specifically, the existing literature provides evidence for the existence of at least five symptom subtypes that are characterized by (i) migraine symptoms; (ii) cognitive and emotional symptoms (iii); cognitive and sleep symptoms; (iv) neurological symptoms; and (v) undefined feelings (i.e. "don't feel right" and confusion). The literature also provides evidence for relations between symptom subtypes and clinical outcomes. More specifically, symptoms relating to the migraine subtype were most strongly related to aspects of clinical outcome (e.g. prolonged recovery and cognitive deficits). Symptom subtyping may be informative with regard to the underlying cause(s) and prognosis of SRC, and may be useful to define optimal combinations of interventions in SRC management. Unfortunately, there is no research on the classification of symptom subtypes beyond the typical course of recovery, while targeted SRC management may be considered particularly crucial for the group of patients with persistent symptoms after SRC, where considerable negative impact on daily life and participation is at stake.

### Concussion [^1133mCG4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Concussions are a common injury for which patients often present first to primary care physicians. They can affect the day-to-day function of patients in school and work, as well as in sports and recreational activities. Recognizing common physical signs and symptoms after injury facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment, permitting initiation of an active management approach to recovery while preventing secondary injury. For persons with persistent symptoms, active rehabilitation may be utilized, with the goal of returning patients to full function.

### Acute concussion [^117UvrEs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Concussions are the most common type of traumatic brain injury. They result from external force to the head that causes a neuro-metabolic cascade to unfold. This can then lead to a variety of symptoms in the domains of physical, cognition, mood, and sleep. Concussions are a clinical diagnosis but it is important to rule out acute intracranial pathology through a detailed history and physical examination in addition to possible head imaging. Treatment should include an individualized approach that focuses on what domains are affected after concussion.

### Quality improvement in neurology: concussion quality measurement set [^113TcRkS]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Concussion quality measurement set — definition, epidemiology, burden, recovery, and diagnosis are outlined as follows: Concussion represents the immediate and transient symptoms of a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the United States, there are an estimated 1.1–1.9 million sports and recreation-related concussions in children each year, yet only about 600,000 are seen by a health care provider; approximately 1 million outpatient clinic and emergency department (ED) visits for minor head injury in children occur annually, with an additional 1 million in adults, and Twenty-nine percent of adults self-report having experienced a concussion in their lifetime. Concussion can occur at any age, with the highest incidence in children age 10–19, and in sports with similar rules between sexes/genders females have a higher risk of concussion. Economic and clinical impacts include that children with persistent symptoms incur an average of $3,557 in medical costs related to care administered following the first 4 weeks postinjury. Much of the existing research and most published guidelines focus on sports-related concussion, yet only half of pediatric ED visits for concussion are sport-related. Recovery varies by age, as most adults with sport-related concussion return to previous levels of symptoms and functioning within 10 days, whereas approximately 20%–30% of children continue to have symptoms longer than 1 month; persistent postconcussion symptoms are associated with significant morbidity and lower quality of life. Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis with subjectivity and uncertainty, and a validated objective biomarker has not been established.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to make these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: evidence for subtype classification [^114A8BKF]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Concussion is a heterogeneous mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) characterized by a variety of symptoms, clinical presentations, and recovery trajectories. In 2014, the prevalence of key concussion signs and symptoms was described in "Concussion Guidelines Step 1: Systematic Review of Prevalent Indicators", and concussion was broadly defined. In addition to often nonspecific clinical indicators of concussion, there is a wide variability of patient presentations, challenging clinicians and researchers to identify sensitive and specific means of diagnosis. By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations or profiles into "concussion subtypes and associated conditions", we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments. A collaboration with national multidisciplinary experts aimed to further define and identify evidence supporting 5 predominant concussion subtypes: 1) cognitive, 2) ocular-motor, 3) headache/migraine, 4) vestibular, and 5) anxiety/mood, as well as 2 concussion-associated conditions: 1) sleep disturbance and 2) cervical strain. The primary objective of this effort was to use evidence-based methodology to report the prevalence of subtypes in concussion patients as compared to normal populations, thereby establishing a framework and guidelines for future research. On December 16, 2016, an expert workgroup convened to direct the clinical description of concussion subtypes for the purpose of conducting a systematic review and analysis of the literature with guideline development.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^111xeAyY]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) — clinical conclusions and management: SRC is common among athletes and a common reason for medical encounters with sports medicine physicians, and concussion is a complex, heterogeneous brain injury that typically clinically resolves in 1 to 4 weeks. The diagnosis of concussion is challenging because it relies on self-reported symptoms and there are no readily available objective diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. Sports medicine physicians and others who diagnose concussion should be familiar with the psychometric properties of the sideline and office assessment tools they are using. After a brief period of rest, acutely concussed patients can be encouraged to gradually and progressively increase their physical and cognitive activity while staying below their symptom-exacerbation thresholds. In cases of prolonged symptoms, a multidisciplinary team experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion should be considered. There are many beneficial aspects to participation in sport and exercise that should be balanced against the concern for concussion.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to discharge from hospital, LCG 2022 guidelines recommend to provide the patient and support person with written and verbal information upon discharge, including:

- symptoms and signs of acute deterioration and when to seek urgent follow-up, such as in case of worsening or new symptoms

- typical post-concussive symptoms and reassurance about anticipated recovery

- lifestyle advice to assist recovery

- a discharge report and a written copy of the information provided to the patient for the primary care provider.

### Neuropsychiatric aspects of concussion [^116rC5SN]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, concussion has become the most widely discussed injury in contact sports. However, concussions also occur in several other settings, such as non-contact sports, elderly individuals, young children, military personnel, and victims of domestic violence. Concussion is frequently undiagnosed as a cause of psychiatric morbidity, especially when the patient has no history of loss of consciousness or direct head trauma. Almost all of the extant literature focuses on traumatic brain injury and assumes that concussion is merely a mild form of traumatic brain injury, which has resulted in a lack of understanding about what concussion is, and how to diagnose, monitor, and treat its varied neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this Review, we address key issues so that the psychiatric clinician can better understand and treat patients with a clinical phenotype that might be the direct result of, or be exacerbated by, concussion. Future research needs to focus on prospective clinical trials in all affected patient populations (ie, those affected by concussion and those affected by various degrees of traumatic brain injury), the identification of reliable biomarkers that can be used to assist with diagnosis and treatment response, and the development of effective treatment interventions. Clearly differentiating concussion from traumatic brain injury is essential to achieve reliable and clinically relevant outcomes.

### Living Concussion Guidelines: guideline for concussion&prolonged symptoms for adults 18 years of age or older: 2023 April update [^1113s4VS]. ConcussionsOntario (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to return to activity, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to encourage patients with prolonged symptoms to become gradually more active and educate them about tolerance levels. Counsel patients to recognize the point at which mild symptoms have onset, for any activity (physical or cognitive), and to push to or beyond that point in a manner not resulting in a significant or prolonged exacerbation of symptoms.

### Managing patients with prolonged recovery following concussion [^113LT7XN]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms following concussion can be debilitating for patients and challenging for clinicians; however, evidence-based approaches to symptom management are emerging. The presentation of postconcussion syndrome can be variable among patients. Given this variability, a thorough history and physical examination are necessary to tailor an individualized treatment approach. Pharmacologic interventions can be considered when prolonged symptoms are negatively affecting quality of life. This article reviews evidence available to guide such treatment decisions.

In this cohort study of 303 children aged 6 to 72 months recruited from urban pediatric emergency departments and daycares, those with concussion exhibited more postconcussive symptoms than uninjured children and children with orthopedic injury acutely and at 10 days, 1 month, and 3 months after injury. Symptoms, documented using a developmentally-appropriate measure, were most common in the physical and behavioral domains.

Meaning

These findings suggest that early childhood concussion can result in significantly elevated postconcussive symptoms, which may remain present 3 months after injury and are not solely attributable to general injury effects or typical development.

Definitions and clarifications

Concussion

The fifth international consensus statement on concussion in sport defines concussion as '[a subset of mild] traumatic brain injury induced by biomechanical forces'Several common features that may be used in clinically defining the nature of a concussive head injury can be found in box 1.

Box 1
Definition of concussion from the consensus statement on concussion in sport: the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Berlin, October 2016

Concussion may be caused either by a direct blow to the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an impulsive forces transmitted to the head.
Concussion typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously. However, in some cases, symptoms and signs may evolve over a number of minutes to hours.
Concussion may result in neuropathological changes, but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than a structural injury and, as such, no abnormality is seen on standard structural neuroimaging studies.
Concussion results in a range of clinical signs and symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive symptoms typically follows a sequential course. However, in some cases symptoms may be prolonged.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^1115efuF]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

In this context, separating concussion as a distinct pathophysiological entity is very problematic (figure 2 A). There is no clear pathological definition to distinguish concussion from other types of TBI, and the injuries leading to concussion are biomechanically similar to other types of TBI. Therefore, there is no a priori reason to think that concussion and mild TBI could be distinguished pathologically. It is also unclear how a clinician might decide between mild TBI and concussion, as the symptoms and signs of concussion also follow other types of TBI. For example, headache, cognitive impairment, emotional lability, loss of consciousness and sleep disturbance, each occur to variable extents after all types of TBI. Therefore, it is futile to try to separate concussion as a distinct entity on clinical grounds.

Figure 2
Two potential classification systems for traumatic brain injury and concussion.

There are also problems in retaining concussion as a diagnostic label for the constellation of symptoms that are commonly experienced after TBI. Here concussion usually implies a 'benign' set of problems that will eventually resolve spontaneously. However, the assumed transience of 'concussion' symptoms is problematic, as many patients do not recover quickly and it is difficult to predict long-term outcome after TBI. Even apparently trivial injuries can sometimes have long-term effects, with patients reporting similar postconcussive symptoms after TBI of all severities. This can result in a circularity in diagnosis and prognostication. It is easy for the neurologist, who often has limited access to information about the nature of the original injury, to assume that a constellation of 'postconcussive' symptoms is likely to be benign — because of their 'postconcussive' nature. This can obviously result in patients being inappropriately reassured that their symptoms will spontaneously resolve, as well as a lack of investigation and treatment.

Diagnosis of concussion — the diagnosis is challenging and based on clinical assessment; it is complicated by a lack of validated, objective diagnostic tests, reliance on self-reported symptoms, and confounding symptoms from other conditions; nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, "fogginess", dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and neck pain may also originate from other etiologies; symptoms may be delayed or initially unrecognized, and concussion remains a clinical diagnosis made by synthesizing history and physical examination findings as the injury evolves.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of mild TBI (concussions): what you need to know [^114U6mAc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents and is a form of mild traumatic brain injury that surgeons will see in their acute care practice. With a rapidly changing evidence base for diagnosis and management, we will focus on the importance of timely identification and diagnosis, as well as the early initiation of active management of pediatric concussion immediately after injury through recovery. This approach involves the application of targeted therapies for specific deficits identified after concussion, addressing the individual pattern of symptoms experienced by patients following concussion. We will review what is known about the underlying pathophysiology that drives the clinical manifestations of concussion, the targeted clinical assessments that can both aid in the diagnosis of concussion, as well as drive the active rehabilitation of deficits seen after concussion. The standardized approach to the return to activities will also be described, including return to learning and sports.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to evaluation of prolonged symptoms, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that prolonged physical, cognitive, and/or psychological symptoms following concussion can be nonspecific and may overlap. Assess for differential diagnoses carefully and thoroughly, as similar symptoms (headache, pain, fatigue, concentration problems) are common in chronic pain, depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and other medical and psychiatric disorders.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, which makes the diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has changed significantly over the last several years. The previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned in favor of more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to assist in management. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a health care provider. Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion is crucial, because repeat concussions can result in decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes.

### Rehabilitation of persistent symptoms after concussion [^115t4TYb]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

One of the more challenging aspects beyond acute concussion management occurs when symptoms do not resolve as anticipated over time. The term postconcussion syndrome generally refers to a presentation of multiple ongoing symptoms months to years from injury, typically comprised of physical, cognitive, and emotional complaints such as headaches, poor sleep, poor concentration, dizziness, and irritability. Although individual factors vary, the condition is often regarded as multifactorial. Persistent issues can pose a threat to full community reintegration following concussion and reduce overall quality of life; thus early recognition and treatment are essential to optimize long-term outcomes.

### Concussions and their consequences: current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on concussion:

- Definition: Concussion is a mTBI induced by direct or indirect biomechanical force transmitted to the head that is characterized by reversible symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.
- Pathophysiology: Concussion is caused by biomechanical force transmitted to the head in the setting of work environment, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreation, and falls at home among elderly.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and on occasions malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may cause post-traumatic epilepsy, postconcussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration leading to dementia and movement disorders.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Concussion is associated with increased mortality risk in the elderly with adjusted HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.16–1.34).

Most athletes who experience a sports-related concussion recover from the acute effects within a few weeks. However, some children and adolescents with concussion experience symptoms for many weeks, or even months after the injury. Subacute and chronic symptoms related to concussion are particularly concerning in children, because cognitive deficits, headache or neck pain, sleep dysfunction, and emotional dysregulation can affect school performance and social function at a critical period of development and maturation. This article reviews the epidemiology of subacute symptoms after pediatric concussion and the current recommendations for the assessment and management of these symptoms in children and adolescents.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^1112PvUT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a common injury managed by team physicians. This statement was developed by the Team Physician Consensus Conference (TPCC) to address selected issues on SRC relevant to the practicing team physician. Key points from this TPCC are noted below. This document is the latest revision to Team Physician consensus statements on SRC originally published in 2006and updated in 2011.

Key points

The diagnosis of sport-related concussion (SRC) remains a challenge due to non-specific symptoms and lack of objective biomarkers.
SRC is a treatable condition.
The number and severity of initial symptom burden is the best predictor for the duration of recovery.
Current evidence suggests strict rest after SRC slows recovery and increases the probability of prolonged symptoms.
The majority of athletes with SRC recover within a typical timeframe (2 weeks for adults and up to 4 weeks for children).
Persisting Symptoms after SRC (PSaSRC) is defined as symptoms that last longer than the typical timeframe. The pathophysiology underlying PSaSRC is not entirely understood. It is thought PSaSRC is not caused by a single pathologic process, but rather an interaction of postinjury symptoms that are complicated by pre-existing, coexisting and/or resulting biopsychosocial factors.
The management of disabling PSaSRC often requires a multidisciplinary approach.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^115rBLxs]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We propose that the term concussion should be retired because it has no clear and consistently understood definition, leads to diagnostic confusion and can limit the use of effective treatments of post-traumatic problems. Instead, neurologists should adopt a single classification system for all TBI based on injury severity and attempt a precise diagnosis of post-traumatic problems. It is important to recognise that mild TBI is not always a benign condition, and patients sometimes fail to recover from what may appear to be innocuous injuries. It is difficult to predict clinical outcome and interventions can reduce the burden of disability after TBI. Therefore, neurologists should review more patients with TBI and intervene more actively.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^115P7jLF]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Return to sport after concussion — Concussion-related symptoms and signs should be resolved before returning to sport, and a return-to-play progression involves a gradual, stepwise increase in physical demands and sport-specific activities without return of symptoms before the final introduction of exposure to contact. The athlete should also demonstrate psychological readiness for returning to play, the progression is individualized based on injury characteristics, age, history of SRC, level of play, and supervision, and the return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric; in general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage.

### Defining asymptomatic status following sports concussion: fact or fallacy? [^115PRhym]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The current management of sports concussion involves a return to the baseline 'asymptomatic' status prior to returning to play and training. Unfortunately, although the term 'asymptomatic' is widely used it has not been operationally defined. This review identifies the need to formally define the term 'asymptomatic' as used in sports concussion, discusses some of the challenges associated with its definition and offers some possible solutions for further debate. The operational definition of the term 'asymptomatic' may provide the stimulus for further informed discussion at a future meeting of the international Concussion in Sport group, and by other peak sports medicine bodies involved in management guideline development.

### Current concepts in concussion: initial evaluation and management [^112VqMDY]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. Concussion can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom. Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before diagnosis is established. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management. Initial management also involves patient education and reassurance and symptom management. Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a more conservative approach to management is warranted.

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: a systematic review [^115VrQcn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The strongest and most consistent predictor of slower recovery from concussion was greater severity of a person's acute and subacute symptoms following injury. Having a low-level of symptoms in the first day or two following injury was a favourable prognostic indicator. The development of subacute problems with headaches or depression are likely risk factors for persistent symptoms lasting greater than a month. Children, adolescents and young adults with a preinjury history of mental health problems or migraine headaches appear to be at somewhat greater risk for having symptoms greater than 1 month. Those with ADHD or learning disabilities might require more careful planning and intervention regarding returning to school, but they do not appear to be at substantially greater risk for persistent symptoms beyond a month. The teenage years, particularly high school, might be the most vulnerable time for having persistent symptoms — with greater risk for girls than boys.

What is already known?

Concussions can have large adverse effects on cognitive functioning and balance in the first 24 hours following injury.
Athletes report diverse physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms acutely and subacutely.
A greater number and severity of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a slower recovery in some studies.
A large percentage of injured athletes recover clinically within 10 days, and the large majority appear to recover within 1 month.
Injury severity characteristics, such as loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia and post-traumatic amnesia are not consistent or strong predictors of recovery time in some studies.

What are the new findings?

For the majority of predictors, the literature is mixed with positive and negative findings.
Preinjury mental health problems and prior concussions appear to be risk factors for persistent symptoms.
Greater acute and subacute symptoms are a consistent predictor of worse clinical outcome.
The teenage years might be a particularly vulnerable time for having persistent symptoms — with greater risk for girls than boys.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^117GBErY]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — communication and education: Evidence from high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) state that most people recover well and typically do not have significant difficulties that last more than 1 to 3 months post injury. High-quality CPGs based on moderate-level evidence indicate that after an initial period of rest for the first 24 to 48 hours, patients with concussion should be encouraged to avoid activities that have a high risk for another concussion but gradually resume normal activity, based on their tolerance. Physical therapists must educate patients who have experienced a concussive event about self-management of symptoms, the importance of relative rest (rest as needed) instead of strict rest, the benefits of progressive re-engagement in activities, the importance of sleep, safe return-to-activity pacing strategies, and potential signs and symptoms of the need for follow-up care with a physician, physical therapist, or other health care providers, and must educate patients and their families/caregivers about symptoms and functional limitations associated with concussion and stress that most patients with concussion recover relatively quickly.

### Optimal recovery following pediatric concussion [^116qKyQk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Concussion affects millions of children annually, leading to physical, cognitive, sleep, and emotional symptoms that typically resolve within 4 weeks of injury. Approximately 30% of children experience persisting symptoms beyond that time, which can impact academic and psychological functioning and reduce quality of life. Given most children return to preinjury levels of function within a few weeks, there is a need to better understand how recovery optimally evolves and what distinguishes children who recover well from those who do not.

Optimal functioning is poorly defined, and little is known of what contributes to good recovery. To date, work has mostly focused on how individual predispositions, such as psychological resilience, affect outcome. Adopting a comprehensive view of optimal outcome, Beauchamp and colleaguesstudied the concept through the lens of wellness, defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of deficits. They operationalized this concept by combining common outcome indicators such that children who sustained concussion were characterized as being well if they had no persisting symptoms, no cognitive difficulties, and above average quality of life. Using this approach, 41.5% of participants in the study by Beauchamp and colleaguesmet the wellness criteria 4 weeks after concussion, increasing to 52.2% by 12 weeks after injury. Children who were younger, sustained concussion in sports or recreation settings, did not have preinjury developmental problems, and had better acute working memory were more likely to show optimal recovery. Using a similar, comprehensive approach to define optimal outcome in a cohort of children who sustained concussion during early childhood (18–60 months), Aubuchon and colleaguesfound that fewer children with concussion had optimal functioning over 6 and 18 months after injury compared with children with orthopedic injuries or typical development.

### Depressive symptoms in individuals with persistent postconcussion symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yKmzd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Although the rate of concussion (or mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]) recovery can vary considerably from one individual to another, the vast majority fully recover within days to weeks following the injury. Yet, an important minority (ie, 15%-30%), of individuals who experienced a concussion will experience symptoms for months or years following the injury, often referred to as persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). Although symptoms vary from person to person, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, and emotional changes are commonly reported and can significantly impact an individual's everyday functioning. PPCS have been associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes, including reduced quality of life, as well as higher levels of disability and psychological distress. The etiology of PPCS is diverse and multifactorial, with prognosis varying between individuals. The treatment of PPCS remains inconclusive, given that symptoms following a concussion (eg, headache, irritability) are nonspecific and can be commonly reported in healthy individuals, as well as in clinical groups with health conditions unrelated to mTBI. To account for the complexity of PPCS presentation, reference standard guidelines for pediatric and adult populations recommend a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to treatment.

### Current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of concussion in sport: a comparison of three new guidelines [^111DZ9wz]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable debate within the sports medicine community about the role of concussion and the risk of chronic neurological sequelae. This concern has led to significant confusion among primary care providers and athletic trainers about how to best identify those athletes at risk and how to treat those with concussion. During the first quarter of 2013, several new or updated clinical practice guidelines and position statements were published on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injury/concussion in sports. Three of these guidelines were produced by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, The American Academy of Neurology, and the Zurich Consensus working group. The goal of each group was to clearly define current best practices for the definition, diagnosis, and acute and post-acute management of sports-related concussion, including specific recommendations for return to play. In this article, we compare the recommendations of each of the three groups, and highlight those topics for which there is consensus regarding the definition of concussion, diagnosis, and acute care of athletes suspected of having a concussion, as well as return-to-play recommendations.

### Partnering with patients, caregivers, and clinicians to determine research priorities for concussion [^116HyPcY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This JLA PSP gathered opinions from more than 1000 patients, caregivers, and clinicians and, through a multistep process, identified the top 10 unanswered research questions that matter most to those affected by concussion. The project brought together a broad and diverse group of patients, caregivers, and clinicians from across Canada and, to our knowledge, is the first patient-oriented research priority-setting project in concussion. The top 10 questions identify priority areas on which researchers and research networks can focus to improve outcomes for people living with concussion.

Taken as a whole, the list of research priorities is broad in scope and reflects the diverse concerns of patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Priorities include early and accurate diagnosis after a head injury, specific symptom management, approaches to ensure a safe return to physical and cognitive activities after concussion, predicting and preventing prolonged symptoms and poor outcomes, and understanding the pathophysiology of concussion.

The top-ranked question focuses on identifying patients at high risk for prolonged symptoms at the time of diagnosis and developing a personalized management strategy. With up to 30% of people with concussion experiencing symptoms longer than 1 month, early and accurate identification of risk factors for prolonged symptoms was deemed the highest priority. Risk factors associated with prolonged recovery have been identified, and a clinical risk score has been validated for pediatric patients, and is now in development for adult patients. However, despite considerable research, there are no validated physiological, serological, or radiological biomarkers that can accurately diagnose concussion and predict recovery. Therefore, more research is needed to implement existing validated tools into clinical pathways and to develop additional biomarkers and strategies to refine diagnosis and personalize therapies to improve outcomes.

Three questions focused on improving early diagnosis and management of concussion. The first concerns the role of interdisciplinary teams of health care professionals (eg, physicians, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, mental health professionals, vision specialists) in assessing and managing concussion and asks which patients should be referred early to these teams to achieve the best outcomes. A second question focused on the need to develop approaches to differentiate symptoms due to concussion from those of nonconcussion medical problems that may have similar symptoms but require different therapies. The third question concerns the variation in abilities of clinicians to recognize and manage concussion. With concussion diagnosis and management recommendations changing frequently, educating clinicians on concussion was considered important to improve recognition and standardize management.

Symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury typically resolve within days or weeks. However, a significant group of patients may report symptoms of Post-concussional Syndrome (PCS) weeks, months and years postinjury. This review presents an overview of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment options for PCS. The authors review the evidence for factors that may predict such symptoms. At early phases, there are associations between neurological signs and symptoms, neurocognitive functions and self reports. Over time, such associations become less coherent, and psychological issues become particularly relevant. An accurate understanding of neurological and psychosocial factors at play in PCS is crucial for appropriate management of symptoms at various points postinjury.

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: a systematic review [^114QNGri]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Most children, adolescents and young adults who experience a sport-related concussion will recover, from a clinical perspective, within 1 month. However, it is important to appreciate that the subgroup of children and adolescents who are taken to the emergency department following a sport-related concussion is at much greater risk for symptoms lasting beyond a month. In a multisite Canadian study, 30% of these children and adolescents reported persistent symptoms after 4 weeks. Both within and beyond the first month following injury, it is well understood in research and clinical practice that there are individual differences in recovery trajectories. In general, the literature is complex, mixed and difficult to interpret definitively.

Concussions after recreational activities, especially athletics, are a frequent complaint in the emergency department. In the past few years, care of these patients has been simplified as grading systems and classifications have been abandoned. However, questions remain as to the best way to rehabilitate these patients to avoid long-term sequelae, especially in children and adolescents. The purpose of this review is to discuss the demographic characteristics, the pathophysiology, definition, clinical characteristics, and management of concussions in children and adolescents.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: evidence for subtype classification [^113msbpi]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Concussion is a heterogeneous mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) characterized by a variety of symptoms, clinical presentations, and recovery trajectories. By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments.

Objective

To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD).

Results

The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P < .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P < .001). Furthermore, ocular-motor in adult patients (SMD = 0.72; P < .001) and vestibular symptoms in both pediatric and adult patients (SMD = 0.18 and 0.36; P < .05) were significantly worse in concussion patients than in controls.

Conclusion

Five concussion subtypes with varying prevalence within 3 d following injury are commonly seen clinically and identifiable upon systematic literature review. Sleep disturbance, a concussion-associated condition, is also common. There was insufficient information available for analysis of cervical strain. A comprehensive acute concussion assessment defines and characterizes the injury and, therefore, should incorporate evaluations of all 5 subtypes and associated conditions.

Persisting symptoms after SRC

The majority of athletes with SRC recover within the typical timeframe, currently defined as 2 weeks for adults and up to 4 weeks for children. PSaSRC is defined as symptoms that last longer than the typical timeframe.

The pathophysiology underlying PSaSRC is not entirely understood. It is thought PSaSRC is not caused by a single pathologic process, but rather an interaction of postinjury symptoms that are complicated by pre-existing, coexisting and/or resulting biopsychosocial factors.

It is important to perform a thorough evaluation for other etiologies of the symptoms, such that these may be identified and treated appropriately.

Factors that may be associated with greater odds of developing PSaSRC include:

High symptom load immediately after injury
Prolonged strict cognitive and physical rest (more than a few days) after the concussion
Unrecognised, untreated or inadequately treated initial SRC.
Suffering another direct impact to the head or from transmitted (indirect) forces from the body to the head while still symptomatic from a concussion.
Personal or family history of migraine or mood disorder
Premorbid diagnosis of learning difficulties
Family and social stressors
Increased baseline level of SRC symptoms (pre-SRC)

Of all these risk factors, pre-existing mood disorder and high symptom load immediately after injury have been shown to be the most consistent predictors of PSaSRC.

Athletes who are removed from activity immediately after the injury seem to be less likely to develop PSaSRC than those who continue to play immediately after the injury.

Risk for PSaSRC may be reduced by removing the athlete from play immediately after the injury, instituting relative physical and cognitive rest for the first 24–48 hours, and then gradually resuming usual activities that do not exacerbate symptoms.

Early individualised subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise training may reduce the risk for developing PSaSRC.

Treatment of persisting symptoms after SRC

With treatment(s), most athletes with PSaSRC will recover without any long-term sequelae. A small percentage may experience long-term symptoms or deficits.

Athletes with PSaSRC require symptom-targeted treatment which may involve a multidisciplinary team. Treatments that have been shown to be effective in facilitating recovery of specific symptoms for athletes with PSaSRC include cervical spine rehabilitation, subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise training, vestibular and oculomotor therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, academic adjustments and lifestyle adjustments involving sleep, nutrition and hydration. Pharmacologic treatment is used rarely in SRC and selectively for PSaSRC.

### Association between early return to school following acute concussion and symptom burden at 2 weeks postinjury [^112SaXiJ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Determining how the timing of return to school is related to later symptom burden is important for early postinjury management recommendations.

Objective

To examine the typical time to return to school after a concussion and evaluate whether an earlier return to school is associated with symptom burden 14 days postinjury.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Planned secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study from August 2013 to September 2014. Participants aged 5 to 18 years with an acute (< 48 hours) concussion were recruited from 9 Canadian pediatric emergency departments in the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada Network.

Exposure

The independent variable was the number of days of school missed. Missing fewer than 3 days after concussion was defined as an early return to school.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was symptom burden at 14 days, measured with the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI). Symptom burden was defined as symptoms status at 14 days minus preinjury symptoms. Propensity score analyses applying inverse probability of treatment weighting were performed to estimate the relationship between the timing of return to school and symptom burden.

Results

This cohort study examined data for 1630 children (mean age [SD]11.8 [3.4]; 624 [38%] female). Of these children, 875 (53.7%) were classified as having an early return to school. The mean (SD) number of days missed increased across age groups (5–7 years, 2.61 [5.2]; 8–12 years,3.26 [4.9]; 13–18 years, 4.71 [6.1]). An early return to school was associated with a lower symptom burden 14 days postinjury in the 8 to 12-year and 13 to 18-year age groups, but not in the 5 to 7-year age group. The association between early return and lower symptom burden was stronger in individuals with a higher symptom burden at the time of injury, except those aged 5 to 7 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of youth aged 5 to 18 years, these results supported the growing belief that prolonged absences from school and other life activities after a concussion may be detrimental to recovery. An early return to school may be associated with a lower symptom burden and, ultimately, faster recovery.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Concussion is a heterogeneous mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) characterized by a variety of symptoms, clinical presentations, and recovery trajectories. By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments.

OBJECTIVE

To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury.

METHODS

A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD).

RESULTS

The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P < .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P < .001).

### Concussion in the UK: a contemporary narrative review [^1117g4Bd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Sequalae

Concussion recovery usually occurs within a few days. Occasionally, if symptoms persist beyond 10–14 days, PCS is diagnosed. PCS is complex and historically controversial; however, it is now widely recognized in research and clinical practice as a constellation of non-specific post-traumatic symptoms. These may be linked to other coexisting factors separate from ongoing physiological injury. PCS presents variably and symptoms often fall into the somatic, cognitive, psychological/behavioral and sleep subgroups (table 4).

Table 4
Common signs/symptoms of PCS

These symptoms have major impact on quality of life. Eighty-two per cent of patients with mTBI in one large prospective study experienced at least one symptom at 6 and 12 months postinjury. Unfortunately, 40% of the participants demonstrated clinically significant dissatisfaction with life at 12 months using the Satisfaction With Life Score at 12 months postconcussion. Despite media coverage of concussion and PCS in sports, outside of these environments PCS remains problematic to diagnose as symptoms are often non-specific and common to many conditions. Diagnosis also relies on correct original concussion diagnoses which, as previously discussed, is fraught with complication.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT: ▸ To provide an evidence-based, best practises summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. ▸ To establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research.

Importance Of An Amssm Statement

▸ Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. ▸ Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. ▸ The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. ▸ While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

Definition

▸ Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

Pathophysiology

▸ Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. ▸ Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction.

Incidence

▸ It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the United States per year during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of the concussions may go unreported. ▸ Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: ▸ A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another concussion. ▸ A greater number, severity and duration of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. ▸ In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. ▸ Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk of concussion. ▸ Youth athletes may have a more prolonged recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. ▸ Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders, attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate diagnosis and management of a concussion.

Diagnosis Of Concussion

▸ Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and evaluation of concussion. ▸ Graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. ▸ Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available.

Sideline Evaluation and Management

▸ Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. ▸ Recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination. ▸ While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown. ▸ Balance disturbance is a specific indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injury. ▸ Imaging is reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. ▸ There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. ▸ Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status.

Neuropsychological Testing

▸ Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle cognitive impairment than clinical exam. ▸ Most concussions can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. ▸ Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index, baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. ▸ Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment of concussion. ▸ NP testing should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation. ▸ The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not been determined. ▸ In some cases, properly administered and interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. ▸ It is unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. ▸ Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses.

Return To Class

▸ Students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests while recovering from a concussion.

Return To Play

▸ Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. ▸ A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. ▸ If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. ▸ RTP after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: ▸ The primary concern with early RTP is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: ▸ There is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. ▸ Some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define risk factors and causation of any long-term neurological impairment.

Disqualification From Sport

▸ There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport after a concussion. Each case should be carefully deliberated and an individualised approach to determining disqualification taken.

Education

▸ Greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties, including athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare providers to improve concussion recognition, management and prevention. ▸ Physicians should be prepared to provide counselling regarding potential long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions.

Prevention

▸ Primary prevention of some injuries may be possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. ▸ Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding, laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of concussions. ▸ There is no current evidence that mouth guards can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions. ▸ Secondary prevention may be possible by appropriate RTP management.

Legislation

▸ Legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non-scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management.

Future Directions

▸ Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other long-term complications. ▸ Evolving technologies for the diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports concussion.

### Concussion and long-term cognitive impairment among professional or elite sport-persons: a systematic review [^114kYDoe]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The theoretical and operational definitions of sport-related concussion are a matter of ongoing debate, although they are all consistent in suggesting that it should be regarded as a mild traumatic brain injury. The latest 2016 Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport concluded that 'concussion is a traumatic brain injury which (1) might be caused by a direct or indirect blow to the head; (2) typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously; (3) may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical signs and symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than a structural injury and, as such, no abnormality is seen on standard structural neuroimaging studies and (4) might or might not involve loss of consciousness'. According to this definition, it has been shown that numerous athletes have been exposed to head injury events resulting in concussion during playing careers; however, it is reasonable to assume that many more have been exposed to repetitive subconcussive head impact events (eg, when heading a football), the majority of which were below the threshold for a clinical diagnosis of concussion, depending on the nature of the often short-lived neurological symptoms and their interpretation — particularly a few decades ago, when there was less awareness about sport-related concussion.

While there is now a stronger understanding of the potential mechanisms involved in the processes underlying concussion, the epidemiological evidence and the strength of this evidence, to support the long-term effects on cognition remains unclear. A recent systematic review aimed at assessing the long-term neurological sequelae of sport-related concussion concluded that there might be an association with repeated concussion and later cognitive impairment. However, this review included also varsity and amateur athletes, and did not provide an in-depth analysis of the limitation of study design and potential for bias and confounding of the included papers. Understanding whether concussion in sport is significantly associated with worsening of cognitive function in later life is of great importance. Uncovering this possible association would likely have immediate repercussions on current concussion prevention and management policy, sports rules and regulations, and possibly on the listing of cognitive impairment as an occupational diseases for former professional sportspersons.

This systematic review aims to assess and summarise the evidence on the association between concussion sustained by professional/elite athletes and long-term cognitive function as assessed on neurocognitive testing or by clinical diagnosis. Given the recent changes of definitions of concussion, this is considered in broader term, but results are described by the adopted definition and its consistency with the latest consensus.

### Improving outcome after paediatric concussion: challenges and possibilities [^114JhNtw]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

The term concussion has permeated mainstream media and household vocabulary mainly due to awareness regarding the risks of concussion in professional contact sports, yet it occurs across a variety of settings and ages. Concussion is prevalent in infants, preschoolers, children, and adolescents, and is a common presentation or reason for referral to primary care providers, emergency departments, and specialised trauma clinics. Its broad range of symptoms and sequelae vary according to multiple individual, environmental, and clinical factors and can lead to health and economic burden. More than 20 years of research into risk factors and consequences of paediatric concussion has revealed as many questions as answers, and scientific work and clinical cases continue to expose its complexity and heterogeneity. In this Review, we present empirical evidence for improving outcome after paediatric concussion. We consider work pertaining to both sports and other injury mechanisms to provide a perspective that should be viewed as complementary to publications focused specifically on sports concussion. Contemporary challenges in prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention are discussed alongside pathways and future directions for improving outcome.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^117RE3k1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion rehabilitation activity progression — recent work suggests that an earlier, gradual return to activity may be beneficial, and observational and experimental studies indicate that both extremes of strict rest and intense cognitive or physical activity acutely after injury may be associated with delayed recovery trajectories; prolonged rest may lead to secondary effects similar to postconcussion symptoms. Most recent guidance includes recommendations to encourage 24 to 48 hours of complete rest or "relative rest", followed by phased activity progressions based on symptom response, and current clinical recommendations typically advocate for the resumption of low levels of activity in the presence of mild symptoms, as long as symptom exacerbation does not occur.

SRC is a traumatic brain injury, a pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by direct or indirect biomechanical forces (eg, a blow to the head or body).

Common features include the following:

Rapid onset of usually short-lived neurological impairment which typically resolves spontaneously.
Acute signs and symptoms that reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury.
A range of clinical symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness (LOC).
Routine neuroimaging studies (eg, traditional CT or MRI), if obtained are typically normal.
Signs or symptoms that are not explained by other medical issues (eg, alcohol, drugs, medications, cervical spine injury, peripheral vestibular dysfunction, psychological disorder) or other co-morbidities.

### Quality improvement in neurology: concussion quality measurement set [^1128Jtkf]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Current standard of care for concussion — published consensus statements and evidence-based guidelines generally converge on several key recommendations, including (1) removal from and avoidance of at-risk activities, such as contact sports, until medical evaluation and clearance, (2) lack of an indication for acute neuroimaging for the routine diagnosis of concussion in absence of red flags, (3) assessment of concussion-related symptoms, (4) completion of a neurologic physical examination, and (5) a gradual return to physical and cognitive activities prior to medical clearance. The work group aimed to incorporate these key recommendations and several others into quality measures, but lack of current evidence and anticipated difficulty with measurement implementation prevented the development of several proposed measures.

### Concussion assessment in the emergency department: a preliminary study for a quality improvement project [^113Djx3u]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Concussion is one of the complications of a head injury, a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). Evidence in the UK is lacking, but the presentations of concussion to the ED in America has been estimated to be over 150 000 annually. Another study reports that around 100 000 patients per year present to the ED in just the 8–19 age group in America. In sport, where there is more evidence, incidence is highest in rugby and ice hockey.

The operational definition of concussion as the 'immediate and transient symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury' but this has drawn criticism due to a lack of accuracy. The Concussion in Sport Group (CISG)defines concussion as a 'complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces'. This may be due to a blow to the head or body that leads to the rapid development of neurological impairment that does not last long and resolves of its own accord. The acute symptoms are less likely to be due to structural injury and therefore are associated with grossly normal neuroimaging. However, concussion may cause neuropathological changes. The clinical and cognitive symptoms (of which loss of consciousness may be included) of concussion and its sequelae typically resolve gradually. The initial effects of concussion cover a large spectrum of symptoms. The CISGlist these over certain 'clinical domains'. These include somatic/cognitive/emotional symptoms, physical signs such as loss of consciousness, balance impairment, behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and sleep/wake disturbance. The CISG advise that concussion should be suspected if any of the symptoms are present, but acknowledge that they are non-specific.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^116V2rdh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a common injury in recreational and organised sport. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in our scientific understanding of SRC, which in turn has driven the development of clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and management of SRC. In addition to a growing need for knowledgeable healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care for athletes with SRC, media attention and legislation have created awareness and, in some cases, fear about many issues and unknowns surrounding SRC. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a writing group to review the existing literature on SRC, update its previous position statement, and to address current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding SRC. The absence of definitive outcomes-based data is challenging and requires relying on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. This statement reviews the definition, pathophysiology and epidemiology of SRC, the diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, the short-term and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, SRC prevention strategies, and potential future directions for SRC research. The AMSSM is committed to best clinical practices, evidence-based research and educational initiatives that positively impact the health and safety of athletes.

### Updates in the general approach to pediatric head trauma and concussion [^114VBnoP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute recognition and management of traumatic brain injury along the spectrum from mild to severe is essential in optimizing neurocognitive outcomes. Concussion is common following head trauma in children, and resulting symptoms can last for months if not diagnosed and managed properly. Emerging evidence and consensus demonstrate that a program of cognitive and physical activity with a graduated return to play, sport, and school may improve outcomes following concussion. "Return to Play" legislation for youth has been adopted by most states. Outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury have improved.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^114PVwMu]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Concussion — background and identification in first aid describes that concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury that is caused by an action or injury that rapidly moves the head and brain back and forth; according to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2022, 2.3 million children and adolescents had ever received a diagnosis of concussion or brain injury. Signs and symptoms of concussion include headache, nausea, impaired balance, difficulties concentrating, confusion, emotional lability, and fatigue, and repeated concussions may lead to long-term difficulties with memory, concentrating, fatigue, headache, and other neurological sequelae. Symptom-based tools have been developed to assess the presence and severity of a concussion during sports; however, they require specific training, and to date, there is no validated scoring system for concussion identification in the first aid setting. ILCOR performed a scoping review on concussion assessment in 2020, and an updated literature search was performed by the writing group in 2023.

Concussion clinical practice guidance — recovery patterns and the role of physical therapy — notes that many individuals recover within a relatively short period (approximately 7–14 days post injury), yet studies have demonstrated that as many as 5% to 58% of individuals who sustain a concussion have persistent symptoms, impairments, and/or limitations, and the timing of these complaints ranges from a few days to a few weeks or longer. Although it is often reported that symptoms, impairments, and functional limitations follow a gradual pattern of improvement, the trajectory may not be linear, and many patients experience symptom exacerbations during their recovery period; in some cases, these exacerbations may be an immediate reaction to a specific mechanism or a delayed reaction associated with activities over the preceding 24-hour period or longer. Some studies suggest a second injury may worsen neurocognitive function and recovery time and put individuals at risk for additional injuries or more chronic/long-term sequelae. Since approximately 2007, clinical commentaries and studies have supported postconcussion assessment, management, and skilled rehabilitation techniques that fall within physical therapists' scope of practice, and systematic reviews support active rehabilitation strategies for concussions under the direction of a physical therapist as a promising management approach for facilitating recovery; despite this growing body of evidence, additional research is needed to provide more specific insight into factors that affect patient responsiveness and to investigate optimal approaches to physical therapy delivery, timing, and dose.

### Characteristics and outcomes of athletes with slow recovery from sports-related concussion: a CARE consortium study [^111m3qqW]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

These results add important nuance to the evolving narrative about recovery from SRC. The perception of the "typical" recovery from concussion has been changing over the last 15 years, evolving from a belief that such injuries typically have a short-term (7–10 days) period of signs and symptomswith a highly favorable prognosis for full recovery, to concerns that a single concussion may put an individual at risk for long-term consequences including the possibility of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. While not directly contradicting this view, the largely favorable outcomes in the slow to recover athletes is reassuring. While these athletes took longer than 24 days to RTP, it is encouraging that more than three-fourths (77.6%) were able to RTP within 60 days of injury and four-fifths (83.4%) were able to RTP within 88 days of injury. This is an important message to share with slow to recover athletes, who may be worried that they will never RTP.

### Current concepts in concussion: evaluation and management [^115v7Zbm]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Concussion is a disturbance in brain function caused by direct or indirect force to the head. It is a functional rather than structural injury that results from shear stress to brain tissue caused by rotational or angular forces-direct impact to the head is not required. Initial evaluation involves eliminating cervical spine injury and serious traumatic brain injury. Headache is the most common symptom of concussion, although a variety of clinical domains (e.g., somatic, cognitive, affective) can be affected. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptoms must be determined. There are numerous assessment tools to aid diagnosis, including symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. These tools are also used to monitor recovery. Cognitive and physical rest are the cornerstones of initial management. There are no specific treatments for concussion; therefore, focus is on managing symptoms and return to play. Because concussion recovery is variable, rigid classification systems have mostly been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. A graded return-to-play protocol can be implemented once a patient has recovered in all affected domains. Children, adolescents, and those with a history of concussions may require a longer recovery period. There is limited research on the management of concussions in children and adolescents, but concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain suggests that a more conservative approach to management is appropriate in these patients.

### JOSPT perspectives for patients. concussions: an underdiagnosed problem for athletes? [^115ywbdb]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Ignoring symptoms of a concussion and continuing to play after receiving a blow or jolt to the head can be dangerous, make symptoms worse, and delay recovery. Repeated concussions can lead to a longer recovery and may result in long-term problems. Screening tools include checklists of symptoms or quick tests that can help detect a concussion. A study published in the July 2012 issue of used these screening tools to measure changes in player function both before and after a football season.

### Neurologic care in concussion and post-concussive encephalopathy [^113yaFgP]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion has become a more recent "medical fad" with a lot of media coverage and hence an increasing incidence. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention there are estimates of as many as 3.8 million sport-related traumatic brain injuries occurring annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Given these numbers, concussion care will require that both primary and specialist physicians feel comfortable in its management. This article will discuss the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation, therapies and prognosis in patients with concussion. The complex and chronic symptoms after a concussion and their management will be highlighted. Appropriate concussion care is essential for improving both the long and short term outcomes in adolescent athletes. There is an important role for the neurologist in improving the outcome in these athletes.

### Vision and concussion: symptoms, signs, evaluation, and treatment [^114RDAk9]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Vision and concussion — background in children and adolescents: Concussion is a common injury in childhood, affecting an estimated 1.4 million children and adolescents annually in the United States, and although concussion symptoms generally spontaneously resolve over the course of 4 weeks after injury in children and adolescents, up to one-third may have prolonged symptoms. Vision disorders are prevalent in children and adolescents with prolonged symptoms after concussion, with one study from a tertiary referral center reporting that 69% of children and adolescents with a concussion had at least one associated vision disorder and another study finding that 62.5% of those with persisting symptoms had vestibulo-ocular dysfunction. Symptoms associated with these vision disorders include difficulty reading, blurred vision, difficulty focusing, and eye fatigue, and the presence of visual symptoms predicts delayed recovery from concussion in children and adolescents and may also be associated with a delay in a child's return to school and recreational activities, as well as return to driving for adolescents.

### Acute concussion symptom severity and delayed symptom resolution [^1119fyFz]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Up to 30% of children who have concussion initially evaluated in the emergency department (ED) display delayed symptom resolution (DSR). Greater initial symptom severity may be an easily quantifiable predictor of DSR. We hypothesized that greater symptom severity immediately after injury increases the risk for DSR.

Methods

We conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort study of children 8 to 18 years old presenting to the ED with concussion. Acute symptom severity was assessed using a graded symptom inventory. Presence of DSR was assessed 1 month later. Graded symptom inventory scores were tested for association with DSR by sensitivity analysis. We conducted a similar analysis for post-concussion syndrome (PCS) as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision. Potential symptoms characteristic of DSR were explored by using hierarchical cluster analysis.

Results

We enrolled 234 subjects; 179 (76%) completed follow-up. Thirty-eight subjects (21%) experienced DSR. Initial symptom severity was not significantly associated with DSR 1 month after concussion. A total of 22 subjects (12%) had PCS. Scores > 10 (possible range, 0–28) were associated with an increased risk for PCS (RR, 3.1; 95% confidence interval 1.2–8.0). Three of 6 of the most characteristic symptoms of DSR were also most characteristic of early symptom resolution. However, cognitive symptoms were more characteristic of subjects reporting DSR.

Conclusions

Greater symptom severity measured at ED presentation does not predict DSR but is associated with PCS. Risk stratification therefore depends on how the persistent symptoms are defined. Cognitive symptoms may warrant particular attention in future study. Follow-up is recommended for all patients after ED evaluation of concussion to monitor for DSR.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^111H6dgt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Impairment/function-based diagnosis — incidence of concussion/mild traumatic brain injury is variably estimated, with overall incidence rates reported to vary across studies and emergency department (ED) data indicating both sports- and non–sports-related presentations. The CDC estimates that "1.6 to 3.8 million" concussions occur during sports and recreational activities annually, and for 2008 there were "43 802 emergency department (ED) visits for sports-related concussion, and more than 12 times as many reported non–sports-related concussions during the same period". Incidence estimation is limited because "not all individuals who experience a concussive event seek medical care" and "many concussive events go unrecognized or unreported", with symptoms that "can be subtle, vary in presentation, and be easily confused with other common illnesses or injuries", which are "significant challenges to providing accurate estimates of the incidence and prevalence of concussion". The page also notes a research need: "Future research should investigate the prevalence of patients participating in physical therapy who do not have a medical diagnosis of concussion".

Concussion in sport — clinical profiles: The recognition of heterogeneity among concussion presentations has led to the concept of clinical profiles or clinical domains with the potential for more specific prognostic value and targeted treatment, but this is an emerging concept that does not represent clinical standards or norms and may serve to facilitate individualized patient management; although SRC may present with symptoms representing only one clinical profile, it is more common that SRC presents with symptoms and impairment supporting multiple profiles, and profiles may include cognitive, affective (anxiety/mood), fatigue, migraine/headache, vestibular, and ocular, with how clinical profiles fit into clinical care warranting additional research.

### Sport-related concussion: on-field and sideline assessment [^116f2UkE]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The careful and well-planned sideline assessment of concussion can be the difference between a good and bad outcome when managing sport-related concussion. In most cases, the sideline assessment serves as a triage for determining if an injury, such as a concussion, has actually occurred, and if so, establishes a benchmark for determining whether a more serious and potentially catastrophic condition could be developing. Concussions can evolve into something more serious if signs and symptoms go undetected or are ignored. Although these are very rare events, they must always be at the forefront of the clinician's mind.

Pediatric mild traumatic brain injuries, most of which are concussions, are an increasingly common reason for presentation to emergency departments. The diagnosis of concussion has increased dramatically over the past decade, necessitating the acute care provider to have up-to-date knowledge of the definition, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, physical examination findings, and acute management of pediatric concussion. This article also addresses populations most vulnerable to prolonged recovery from pediatric concussion and referral recommendations.

Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS) — A preferred term is persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS), defined as symptoms that persist beyond the expected recovery time frame (> 2 weeks in adults, > 4 weeks in children). Persistent symptoms do not necessarily represent ongoing concussion injury to the brain, and recent systematic reviews have advocated including vestibular, oculomotor, psychological, sleep, cervical and autonomic nervous system evaluations in the assessment to facilitate individualized and targeted management of PPCS.

### Postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in the emergency department: predicting and pre-empting persistent symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury [^112k7nRE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Head injuries across all age groups represent an extremely common emergency department (ED) presentation. The main focus of initial assessment and management rightly concentrates on the need to exclude significant pathology, that may or may not require neurosurgical intervention. Relatively little focus, however, is given to the potential for development of post-concussion syndrome (PCS), a constellation of symptoms of varying severity, which may bear little correlation to the nature or magnitude of the precipitating insult. This review aims to clarify the aetiology and terminology surrounding PCS and to examine the mechanisms for diagnosing and treating.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric concussion in the acute setting [^1142a2fA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Concussion, a type of mild traumatic brain injury, is a common injury encountered by providers caring for pediatric patients in the emergency department (ED) setting. Our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis for symptom and recovery trajectories for pediatric concussion continues to rapidly evolve. As this understanding changes, so do recommendations for optimal management of concussed youth. As more and more children present to EDs across the country for concussion, it is imperative that providers caring for children in these settings remain up-to-date with diagnostic recommendations and management techniques. This article will review the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of pediatric concussion in the ED setting.

### What are the critical elements of sideline screening that can be used to establish the diagnosis of concussion? A systematic review [^112TypB1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sideline detection is the first and most significant step in recognising a potential concussion and removing an athlete from harm. This systematic review aims to evaluate the critical elements aiding sideline recognition of potential concussions including screening tools, technologies and integrated assessment protocols.

Data Sources

Bibliographic databases, grey literature repositories and relevant websites were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2016. A total of 3562 articles were identified.

Study Selection

Original research studies evaluating a sideline tool, technology or protocol for sports-related concussion were eligible, of which 27 studies were included.

Data Extraction

A standardised form was used to record information. The QUADAS-2 and Newcastle-Ottawa tools were used to rate risk of bias. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group system.

Data Synthesis

Studies assessing symptoms, the King-Devick test and multimodal assessments reported high sensitivity and specificity. Evaluations of balance and cognitive tests described lower sensitivity but higher specificity. However, these studies were at high risk of bias and the overall strength of evidence examining sideline screening tools was very low. A strong body of evidence demonstrated that head impact sensors did not provide useful sideline concussion information. Low-strength evidence suggested a multimodal, multitime-based concussion evaluation process incorporating video review was important in the recognition of significant head impact events and delayed onset concussion.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive evidence confirming the diagnostic accuracy of sideline screening tests, consensus-derived multimodal assessment tools, such as the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool, are recommended. Sideline video review may improve recognition and removal from play of athletes who have sustained significant head impact events. Current evidence does not support the use of impact sensor systems for real-time concussion identification.

- Balance problems or dizziness, or double or blurry vision.
- Bothered by light or noise.
- Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy.
- Confusion, or concentration or memory problems.
- Just not "feeling right, " or "feeling down". Signs and symptoms generally show up soon after the injury.

However, you may not know how serious the injury is at first and some symptoms may not show up for hours or days. For example, in the first few minutes your child or teen might be a little confused or a bit dazed, but an hour later your child might not be able to remember how he or she got hurt. You should continue to check for signs of concussion right after the injury and a few days after the injury. If your child or teen's concussion signs or symptoms get worse, you should take him or her to the emergency department right away.
