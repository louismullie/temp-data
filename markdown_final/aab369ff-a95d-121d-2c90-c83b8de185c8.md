## Question

Can we cut eliquis tablet

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Eliquis (apixaban) tablets can be cut in half. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says about tablet integrity and administration options. Then, I should verify whether any pharmacokinetic studies support cutting or only crushing. Next, I will consider dose uniformity and safety implications of splitting a film-coated tablet. After that, I should check if any authoritative guidelines or reviews endorse tablet splitting. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically sound recommendation and note any exceptions or alternatives, like using the oral suspension if available [^53e1ea71] [^c2293cbb].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position. The FDA prescribing information explicitly states that for patients who cannot swallow whole tablets, 2.5 mg and 5 mg Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in water, D5W, apple juice, or mixed with applesauce, or administered via nasogastric tube; it does not mention or endorse cutting or splitting tablets, which is a key distinction I need to keep in mind [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale. The label and clinical studies show that crushed tablets yield comparable exposure to intact tablets, supporting alternative administration when swallowing is difficult; however, there are no data demonstrating comparable exposure or dose uniformity with split tablets, and the film coating and tablet core integrity could affect dissolution and distribution of drug if cut unevenly, which introduces uncertainty about dose accuracy and clinical effect [^7a740795] [^99aad3f0] [^054daa77].

> I should confirm dose uniformity and safety considerations. Film-coated tablets like Eliquis are designed for intact oral administration; splitting can create unequal halves, expose the core to moisture, and potentially alter dissolution kinetics, which could undermine consistent anticoagulation and increase bleeding or thrombotic risk; given apixaban's narrow therapeutic window and the absence of splitting data, this is a meaningful safety concern that argues against routine tablet cutting [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether any guidelines or reviews endorse splitting. I do not find authoritative guidelines or peer-reviewed sources recommending tablet splitting for apixaban; instead, when dose adjustment is needed, the label directs clinicians to use the 2.5 mg strength or employ the approved crushed-tablet administration methods, reinforcing that splitting is not a recognized or validated approach for this drug [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs a dose reduction and only 5 mg tablets are available? I should double-check the labeled dose-reduction criteria. For atrial fibrillation, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily if at least two of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; this is best achieved by prescribing the 2.5 mg tablet rather than attempting to split a 5 mg tablet, which avoids dose inaccuracy and ensures consistent therapy [^a5346f63] [^55758d77].

> I will now examine practical alternatives when swallowing is the issue. If the patient cannot swallow whole tablets, the FDA-supported approach is to crush the 2.5 mg or 5 mg tablet and mix with water, D5W, apple juice, or applesauce, or administer via NG tube, with the mixture used promptly and within the stated stability window; this maintains bioavailability and is a safer, evidence-based substitute for splitting [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Can Eliquis tablets be cut? No, cutting is not recommended because the FDA label does not support it, there is no pharmacokinetic evidence validating dose uniformity with split tablets, and film-coated tablet splitting risks dose inaccuracy and altered drug release; instead, use the appropriate tablet strength or employ the approved crushed-tablet administration methods when needed [^53e1ea71] [^7a740795].

Eliquis (apixaban) tablets **should not be split or cut** because they lack a score line and are not designed for division, which risks uneven dosing and reduced efficacy or increased bleeding [^notfound]. If a dose change is needed, use the correct tablet strength or switch to the oral suspension [^c2293cbb]. If the patient cannot swallow whole tablets, **crush and mix with water, apple juice, or applesauce** and give promptly; crushed tablets are stable for up to 4 hours [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4]. Do not split tablets — this is not recommended by the manufacturer or clinical guidelines.

---

## Manufacturer's guidance on tablet splitting

The manufacturer **does not recommend splitting **Eliquis tablets because they lack a score line and are not designed for division. Splitting can cause uneven dosing, reduced efficacy, or increased bleeding risk.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for splitting Eliquis tablets. The FDA label and clinical guidelines do not address splitting, reinforcing that it is not an accepted practice.

---

## Risks associated with splitting Eliquis tablets

Splitting Eliquis tablets can cause **uneven dosing**, with one half containing more or less than the intended dose, leading to subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic effects. It may also alter pharmacokinetics by changing dissolution and absorption, which can increase bleeding or thrombotic risk. Additionally, handling split tablets can expose patients or caregivers to active drug, posing safety concerns.

---

## Alternative solutions for patients who cannot swallow whole tablets

For patients who cannot swallow whole tablets, **the manufacturer provides clear guidance**:

- **Crushing**: Crush 2.5 mg or 5 mg tablets and suspend in water, 5% dextrose in water, apple juice, or mix with applesauce; administer promptly [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

- **Nasogastric tube administration**: Crush and suspend in 60 mL of water or D5W, deliver via a 12 French NG tube, and flush with 20 mL of water or D5W [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

- **Stability**: Crushed tablets are stable in water, D5W, apple juice, or applesauce for up to 4 hours [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

---

## Clinical scenarios where dose adjustment is necessary

Dose adjustments are **guided by clinical factors**, not by tablet splitting:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with ≥ 2 of: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL | Reduce dose to 2.5 mg twice daily [^a5346f63] [^55758d77] |
| Renal impairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min) | No dose adjustment for VTE treatment or prophylaxis; use standard dosing [^notfound] |
| Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) | Contraindicated [^743afca4] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Eliquis tablets **should not be split or cut** because they lack a score line and are not designed for division. If dose adjustment is needed, use the correct tablet strength or the oral suspension. For patients who cannot swallow whole tablets, crush and mix with water, apple juice, or applesauce, or administer via NG tube as directed [^53e1ea71] [^6f451ca4].

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Pharmacodynamic Drug Interaction Studies

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with aspirin, clopidogrel, aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, enoxaparin, and naproxen were conducted. No pharmacodynamic interactions were observed with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A 50% to 60% increase in anti-FXa activity was observed when ELIQUIS was coadministered with enoxaparin or naproxen.

Specific Populations

Renal impairment: Anti-FXa activity adjusted for exposure to apixaban was similar across renal function categories.

Hepatic impairment: Changes in anti-FXa activity were similar in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. However, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there is no clear understanding of the impact of this degree of hepatic function impairment on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and bleeding. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied.

Pediatric patients: In pediatric patients treated with apixaban, the correlation between anti-FXa activity and plasma concentration is linear with a slope close to 1.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Apixaban has no effect on the QTc interval in humans at doses up to 50 mg.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in exposure for oral doses up to 10 mg.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg of ELIQUIS. Food does not affect the bioavailability of apixaban. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of apixaban appear 3 to 4 hours after oral administration of ELIQUIS. At doses ≥ 25 mg, apixaban displays dissolution-limited absorption with decreased bioavailability. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of water, exposure was similar to that after oral administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets mixed with 30 g of applesauce, the Cmaxand AUC were 20% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following administration of a crushed 5 mg ELIQUIS tablet that was suspended in 60 mL D5W and delivered through a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to that seen in other clinical trials involving healthy volunteers receiving a single oral 5 mg tablet dose.

For patients receiving apixaban tablets doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when apixaban tablets is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of apixaban tablets with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.6 Administration Options

For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, 5 mg and 2.5 mg apixaban tablets tablets may be crushed and suspended in water, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice, or mixed with applesauce and promptly administered orally [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Alternatively, apixaban tablets tablets may be crushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or D5W and promptly delivered through a nasogastric tube [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Crushed apixaban tablets tablets are stable in water, D5W, apple juice, and applesauce for up to 4 hours.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans primarily during the apixaban adult development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of ELIQUIS

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received ELIQUIS.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

### Evaluation of crushed tablet for oral administration and the effect of food on apixaban pharmacokinetics in healthy adults [^99aad3f0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

These studies evaluate the relative bioavailability of crushed apixaban tablets and the effect of food on apixaban pharmacokinetic properties.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, crossover study in 33 healthy adults compared the bioavailability of 2 × 5-mg apixaban tablets administered whole (reference), crushed and suspended in 30 mL of water, and crushed and mixed with 30 g of applesauce. A second open-label, randomized, crossover study in 22 healthy adults compared apixaban 1 × 5-mg tablet administered when fasted (reference) or immediately after consumption of a high-fat, high-calorie meal. Point estimates and 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios were generated for Cmax, AUC0-∞, and AUC0-t.

Findings

Cmax and AUC met bioequivalence criteria for crushed tablets in water. Cmax and AUC decreased by 21.1% and 16.4%, respectively, with the lower bound of the CIs falling below the bioequivalence criteria for crushed tablets with applesauce. Similarly, administration of whole tablets with a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced apixaban Cmax and AUC by 14.9% and 20.1%, respectively. The exposure reductions in both studies were considered not clinically significant.

Implications

Apixaban tablets can be administered crushed or whole, with or without food. The results of these alternative methods of administration support their use in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02101112 and NCT01437839.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of ELIQUIS at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

ARISTOTLE clinical trial (apixaban vs warfarin): The ARISTOTLE trial compared apixaban (5 mg twice daily) with warfarin in patients with non-valvular AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. This blinded, multicenter, randomized control trial had the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism. Patients were randomized to apixaban (n = 9120) versus dose-adjusted warfarin with target INR 2–3 (n = 9081). A total of 18 201 patients were randomized into the study. Based on the primary outcome of stroke or systemic embolization prevention, this study demonstrated apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or embolism (1.27% vs 1.60% per year, HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95; p = 0.01 for superiority, p < 0.001 for non-inferiority). There was a modest reduction in ischemic stroke by about 8%. The major advantage of apixaban was observed with the reduction of hemorrhagic stroke where the prevalence was cut in half. This study was the only trial to show less major bleeding than warfarin. Complications of bleeding including fatal bleeds and ICH were cut by more than half. Also noteworthy, this is the only trial which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mortality rate. There was an 11% reduction in all-cause mortality (3.52% per year vs 3.94% per year, HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.047). In summary, patients with AF and at least one risk factor, apixaban was associated with a greater reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism while having a lower rate of bleeding than warfarin.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^784dae6a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. 1 DOACs are categorized into 2 main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (ie, dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the following years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; ie, warfarin), or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. 2, 3, 4, 5 Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. 6 As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 7

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome and challenging to integrate into everyday clinical use. The purpose of this review is to be a practical reference or algorithm for the busy clinician to navigate key aspects of effective DOAC prescribing, with an emphasis on addressing key situations where clinical uncertainty exists. This review will provide recommendations to address special clinical situations to include indications, use in specific comorbidities, monitoring parameters, transitioning to or off of therapy, drug interactions, and cost.

Apixaban — pharmacology and interactions — Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with an oral bioavailability of > 45%. In healthy men, plasma levels peak about 3 h after oral administration and clearance occurs with a terminal plasma half-life of 8 to 14 h. Elimination involves multiple pathways, including oxidative metabolism and renal and intestinal routes. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, are contraindicated because they increase plasma drug concentrations.

### Reasons for nonadherence to the direct Oral anticoagulant apixaban: a Cross-sectional survey of atrial fibrillation patients [^0a234c85]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design/setting

This was a cross-sectional survey of patients with AF who reported nonadherence to apixaban. Surveys were administered from June to November 2021 at 2 academic medical centers, the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF). The UCLA Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol, with the UCSF relying on the UCLA Institutional Review Board.

Participants

Potential study participants receiving apixaban between August 2019 and August 2021 were identified via large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data extractions at each site and screened for eligibility. Those with email addresses were emailed an electronic Qualtrics survey link, while those without email addresses were mailed paper copies of the survey with a postage-paid return envelope. Nonrespondents received up to 3 to 5 reminders via emails/postal mailings and/or 1 telephone call. Respondents received a $25 gift card for survey completion.

Screening questions for study eligibility were completed by all respondents. Eligible patients were adults prescribed apixaban for AF or atrial flutter who reported "not taking Eliquis" or "sometimes" or "often" missing apixaban doses without a physician's recommendation. Only eligible patients were directed to the survey.

Survey contents (SUPPLEMENTAL Appendix)

Reasons for nonadherence to apixaban

Pre-survey, we performed cognitive interviews with 10 patients to test the comprehensibility, mutual exclusiveness, and adequate representation of questions and response options regarding reasons for patient nonadherence. Questions were iteratively refined based on patient feedback. On the final survey, questions regarding the reasons for patient nonadherence asked patients to select both the most important reason and all applicable responses from a list of 10 potential reasons for nonadherence to apixaban. Patients were also given an option to check 'other' and write-in reason(s).

Cost-related nonadherence was assessed using questions modified from an existing validated 3-item measure. Patients were asked whether they "skipped apixaban (Eliquis) doses", "have taken less apixaban (Eliquis)", or "delayed filling apixaban (Eliquis)" to save money during the last 12 months. Any "yes" response indicated cost-related nonadherence.

For rivaroxaban, the oral half-life is "5.7 to 9.2 hours" with "plasma protein binding of the drug is 92–95%", and "one-third of the dose is excreted in the urine and the remaining two-thirds of the dose is excreted as an inactive metabolite in the feces and the urine"; concomitant use with "P-glycoprotein inhibitors or metabolized by CYP3A4 increases the potential for drug interactions". For apixaban, "maximal effects are observed in 1–2 hours", it has "an oral availability of 45%", and although elimination is mixed, "the drug is primarily excreted through the intestines".

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^daba59b5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor that can be administered in a simple, fixed-dose regimen, may be an option for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in patients with venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the continuation or cessation of anticoagulation therapy. The study drugs were administered for 12 months.

Results

A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization, of whom 2482 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or death from venous thromboembolism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo, as compared with 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0 to 9.3) and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.9 to 9.1) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the placebo group, 0.2% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 0.1% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.3% in the placebo group, 3.0% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 4.2% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rate of death from any cause was 1.7% in the placebo group, as compared with 0.8% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group and 0.5% in the 5-mg apixaban group.

Conclusions

Extended anticoagulation with apixaban at either a treatment dose (5 mg) or a thromboprophylactic dose (2.5 mg) reduced the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism without increasing the rate of major bleeding.

### The X factor: lack of bleeding after an acute apixaban overdose [^d5344544]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We present an acute apixaban overdose without reported coingestants; it is the first such case report associated with multiple serum drug levels to assist in determining overdose kinetics. A 62 year old female presented to an emergency department (ED) 2 hours after ingesting sixty 5 mg tablets (5mg/kg) of her spouse's apixaban medication. She denied coingestants, and did not take her prescribed medications that day. Her vital signs were normal and she denied symptoms. Chemistry and hematology labs were unremarkable. Plasma apixaban concentrations were 2765.6 ng/ml at 14 hours post ingestion with a non-linear half life. There was no utilization of blood products or factor replacement. There was never any bleeding, and her hemoglobin did not decrease. This case demonstrates that a single ingestion of apixaban can occur without any complications occurring.

### An observational study of the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban as reported to eight poison centers [^4fbb408e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Rivaroxaban and apixaban are part of a new group of oral anticoagulants targeting factor Xa and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and 2012. These oral anticoagulants are administered at fixed daily doses, without the need for laboratory-guided adjustments. There are limited data available on supratherapeutic doses or overdose of the oral Xa inhibitors. This study characterizes the clinical effect in patients exposed to rivaroxaban and apixaban.

Methods

A retrospective study collected data from 8 regional poison centers covering 9 states. Cases were initially identified by a search of the poison centers' databases for case mentions involving a human exposure to Xarelto, rivaroxaban, Eliquis, or apixaban. Inclusion criteria included single-substance exposure. Exclusion criteria were animal exposure, polysubstance exposure, or information call. Data for the study were collected by individual chart review, including case narratives, and compiled into a single data set.

Results

There were 223 patients: 124 (56%) were female patients, mean age was 60 years, and 20 were children younger than 12 years (9%). One hundred ninety-eight patients ingested rivaroxaban (89%) and 25 ingested apixaban (11%). Dose was reported in 182 rivaroxaban patients, with a mean dose of 64.5 mg (range 15 to 1,200 mg), and in 21 apixaban patients, with a mean dose of 9.6 mg (range 2.5 to 20 mg). For rivaroxaban, prothrombin time was measured in 49 patients (25%) and elevated in 7; partial thromboplastin time, measured in 49 (25%) and elevated in 5; and international normalized ratio, measured in 61 (31%) and elevated in 13. For apixaban, prothrombin time was measured in 6 patients (24%) and elevated in none; partial thromboplastin time, measure in 6 (24%) and elevated in none; and international normalized ratio, measured in 5 patients (20%) and elevated in none. Bleeding was reported in 15 patients (7%): 11 rivaroxaban and 4 apixaban. The site of bleeding was gastrointestinal (8), oral (2), nose (1), bruising (1), urine (1), and subdural (1). The subdural bleeding occurred after fall and head injury. All cases with bleeding involved long-term ingestions. Coagulation test results were normal in most patients with bleeding: prothrombin time 5 of 6 (83%), partial thromboplastin time 5 of 6 (83%), and international normalized ratio 5 of 9 (55%). Blood products were used in 7 rivaroxaban patients (1 suicide) and 3 apixaban patients. No bleeding or altered coagulation test results occurred in children, which all involved a one-time ingestion. All 12 suicide attempts involved rivaroxaban: altered coagulation test results occurred for 5 patients (42%), no bleeding occurred in any suicide attempt patient, 1 patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma (international normalized ratio 12.47), and dose by patient history did not predict risk of altered coagulation or bleeding. Two rivaroxaban patients experienced elevation of hepatic transaminase levels greater than 1,000 U/L.

Conclusion

Bleeding after Xa inhibitor ingestion as a single agent is uncommon. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or international normalized ratio may be elevated in a minority of cases but appears unreliable to measure risk of bleeding. Massive acute ingestion in suicide attempt may result in significant anticoagulation. Single exploratory ingestion by children was not associated with toxicity.

 Pharmacodynamic Drug Interaction Studies

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with aspirin, clopidogrel, aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, enoxaparin, and naproxen were conducted. No pharmacodynamic interactions were observed with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A 50% to 60% increase in anti-FXa activity was observed when apixaban was coadministered with enoxaparin or naproxen.

 Specific Populations

 Renal impairment: Anti-FXa activity adjusted for exposure to apixaban was similar across renal function categories.

 Hepatic impairment: Changes in anti-FXa activity were similar in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. However, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there is no clear understanding of the impact of this degree of hepatic function impairment on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and bleeding. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied.

 Cardiac Electrophysiology

Apixaban has no effect on the QTc interval in humans at doses up to 50 mg.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in exposure for oral doses up to 10 mg.

 Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg of apixaban tablets. Food does not affect the bioavailability of apixaban. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of apixaban appear 3 to 4 hours after oral administration of apixaban tablets. At doses ≥ 25 mg, apixaban displays dissolution-limited absorption with decreased bioavailability. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of water, exposure was similar to that after oral administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets mixed with 30 g of applesauce, the Cmaxand AUC were 20% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablets that was suspended in 60 mL D5W and delivered through a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to that seen in other clinical trials involving healthy volunteers receiving a single oral 5 mg tablet dose.

 Distribution

Plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 21 liters.

Study Population

The study design and results of the AMPLIFY trial have been reported previously. 12 AMPLIFY was a randomized, active‐controlled, parallel‐group, double‐blind, noninferiority trial in which patients with VTE were enrolled from August 2008 through August 2012. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each center and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. 12

Patients were included if they were aged ≥ 18 years; had objectively confirmed symptomatic proximal deep‐vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE (with or without DVT), and had provided written informed consent. 12 Patients were excluded from the study if they had active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding, < 6 months of anticoagulation planned for the most recent DVT or PE, or an indication other than VTE for which long‐term anticoagulation was planned. Other exclusion criteria included contraindications to treatment with either enoxaparin or warfarin, life expectancy < 6 months, platelet count < 100 000/mm 3, hemoglobin < 9 g/dL, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) < 25 mL/min, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate transaminase > 2×the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin > 1.5×upper limit of normal. 12

Randomization

Patients were assigned to receive apixaban, 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 23 weeks, or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg of body weight every 12 hours for at least 5 days, followed by warfarin, begun concomitantly, for 6 months. 12 Randomization was performed with the use of an interactive voice‐response system and stratified according to the qualifying diagnosis of either symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE (with or without DVT). Patients were assigned to receive apixaban tablets plus placebo enoxaparin injections and placebo warfarin tablets or conventional therapy plus placebo apixaban tablets.

Characteristic of study population

We analyzed results from 24 patients. Mean (SD) age was 64.7 (15.9) years, 50% were female and mean (SD) BMI was 28.1 (7.2) kg/m 2. One participant (4%) self-identified as Hispanic, 23 participants (96%) self-identified as White. All patients dialyzed thrice weekly with a mean (SD) UF-adjusted standard Kt/V of 2.12 (0.26), using 5 different dialyzers and a wide range of dialyzer surface areas (Table 1).

Drug level over time

We did not see signs of accumulation in 25 cases that provided at least 2 measurements (Fig. 2). In these patients, first drug level measurement took place at a median (IQR) of 14 (8–30) days after initiation of apixaban (available data for 15 cases) with a total follow-up time of median (IQR) 12 (2–16) and a range of 1–51 months intake (available data for all cases).

### Ciraparantag reverses the anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in healthy elderly subjects [^e1cdb851]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The two studies were randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trials (# NCT03288454 and # NCT03172910). The objectives of the studies were the following: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating intravenous (IV) doses of ciraparantag; and to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of these ciraparantag doses administered 3 h after the Day 3 dose of steady-state apixaban (Study 1) or rivaroxaban (Study 2) as measured by serial manual WBCT. Pharmacokinetic assessments of ciraparantag, apixaban (Study 1), and rivaroxaban (Study 2), and their major metabolites were performed but are not presented in this report.

Healthy non-smoking subjects, aged 50–75 years (inclusive) were eligible to participate in the studies. Subjects were excluded from the studies if they had any significant clinical medical history including family or personal history of clotting abnormality or excessive bleeding, thrombotic or vascular disease, personal history of major or minor bleeding episodes within 3–6 months prior to screening, blood product or anticoagulant use within the prior 3 months, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use within the prior 2 weeks, use of chronic medication or history of drug or alcohol dependence, were positive for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or C, were pregnant, or participated in any previous ciraparantag study. After informed consent and screening, subjects were confined to a clinical study unit for 5 days (Study 1) or 6 days (Study 2) starting on the day prior to anticoagulant dosing. Enrolled subjects were treated with apixaban (10 mg orally, twice daily for 3.5 days; Eliquis ®; Bristol-Myers Squibb) or rivaroxaban (20 mg orally, once daily for 3 days; Xarelto ®; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) to steady-state anticoagulation. In Study 1, steady-state anticoagulation was defined as WBCT ≥ 20% above baseline 2.75 h after last apixaban dose. In Study 2, steady-state anticoagulation was defined as WBCT ≥ 25% above baseline 3.75 h after last rivaroxaban dose. These levels represent anticoagulant drug levels of ∼150 ng/mL or more. Patients who did not reach criteria for anticoagulation following their apixaban or rivaroxaban treatment were discontinued from the trial and replaced. Key design elements of the two studies are shown in Table 1.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^07b519b1]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran dosing and pharmacology: Direct oral anticoagulants include factor IIa, dabigatran (Pradaxa); and factor Xa, apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) inhibitors. After an oral dose of dabigatran, maximal effects are observed within 2 to 4 hours and the plasma half-life is 13 hours on average. Dosing depends on renal function, with patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than 30mL/minute receiving 150 mg orally twice a day and those with a creatinine clearance lower than 30mL/minute receiving 75 mg given twice daily as recommended. Because dabigatran functions via factor inhibition and not clotting factor depletion, the administration of clotting factors in an effort to reverse the effects of the drug is less effective, and the drug is primarily renally excreted with time to excretion varying depending on renal sufficiency.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Table 3 — properties of anticoagulant medications outlines key half-lives, estimated drug elimination, effect detection, and reversal options. Warfarin (Coumadin) has half-life 40 h and drug elimination 200 with effect detected by PT/INR or chromogenic factor X, and reversal with 4F-PCC (Kcentra), plasma; a footnote specifies plasma only if 4F-PCC is unavailable. Low molecular weight heparins enoxaparin (Lovenox) and dalteparin (Fragmin) list half-life 2–6 h and drug elimination 10–30, detected by Anti-Xa assay, with Protamine as reversal. Unfractionated heparin lists half-life 1.5–2 h and drug elimination 7.5–10 with PTT, anti-Xa assay, and Protamine reversal. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) shows half-life 12–17 h and drug elimination 60–85 with TT and ecarin clotting time used for detection and Idarucizumab (Praxbind) for reversal. Among factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban (Eliquis) has half-life 15 h and drug elimination 75 with Anti-Xa assay and an apixaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC; rivaroxaban (Xarelto) has half-life 9–13 h and drug elimination 45–65 with Anti-Xa assay and a rivaroxaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC. A pharmacokinetic note states that after 5 half-lives the amount of drug remaining is approximately 3%, and time to normal hemostasis may vary with these drugs in patients with renal failure as a result of renal excretion of the medications.

### Cutting delays in reversing anticoagulation after intracerebral haemorrhage: three key changes at a UK comprehensive stroke centre [^9cd4908d]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To further cut delays in giving PCC, we plan to implement prospective review of all VKA-ICH cases at stroke team meetings to improve staff awareness and identify and address any delays as they emerge. Awareness of the protocol for VKA-ICH treatment will also be incorporated in new staff induction. Although we have largely focused on DNT for our centre it is important to note that other factors may influence the efficacy of this treatment. Different preparations of PCC are available and vary from country to country, divided in to three or four factor PCCs, and there is evidence to suggest that four factor PCC is superior to three factor PCC in correcting the INR. Also, it is important to ensure that an adequate dose is administered, as determined by the patient's weight and their admission INR. Newer anticoagulants have recently been licensed (e.g. rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) and although there is uncertainty about how to manage life-threatening bleeding with these agents, it will still be necessary to attempt to normalise clotting as quickly as possible.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^564610ea]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) with conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin, followed by warfarin) in 5395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

Results

The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, as compared with 71 of 2635 (2.7%) in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P < 0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (< 1.80) and difference in risk (< 3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; P < 0.001 for superiority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.55; P < 0.001). Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

A fixed-dose regimen of apixaban alone was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and was associated with significantly less bleeding (Funded by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00643201).

### Apixaban-induced haematoma causing small bowel intussusception [^be6f0875]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Apixaban (Eliquis) is a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) indicated for treatment of deep vein thrombosis, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism and postoperative venous thromboprophylaxis following hip or knee replacement. Complications are minimal and include, but are not limited to, bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage, and haematoma formation. Our patient is a 73-year-old woman who presented with clinical and radiographic findings of small bowel obstruction. She was found to be taking apixaban for atrial fibrillation. CT scan showed small bowel intussusception. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the small bowel intussusception with primary side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathological examination showed that the intussusception was caused by an intramural haematoma. This case presents a rare instance of adult intussusception caused by a DOAC. To our knowledge, no case of intussusception caused by apixaban has yet been found in literature.

### Apixaban (eliquis) for VTE prophylaxis following abdominoplasty: establishing a safety and efficacy profile [^93c955b9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominoplasty and body contouring operations are responsible for a majority of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in aesthetic surgery. Apixaban is a newer oral anticoagulant that may prevent VTE without increasing the risk for hematoma. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of apixaban as a method of anticoagulation for abdominoplasty patients.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted on 282 consecutive abdominoplasty cases performed by the senior author between 2018 and 2023. Patient demographics, surgical details, use of anticoagulation, and postoperative complications were assessed.

Results

282 patients were included. Average BMI was 27.5 (17.5–44.1, SD = 5.1) and average surgical duration was 227 minutes (104–426, SD = 66). Two-hundred sixty-one (92.6%) patients had direct lipectomy and liposuction performed at the time of abdominoplasty. Seventy-eight (27.7%) patients underwent a concurrent breast procedure. Sixty patients had concurrent umbilical hernia repair (21.3%). Eighty-seven patients (30.9%) were prescribed prophylactic apixaban following surgery. Twenty-four patients (8.5%) were prescribed an alternative blood thinner (enoxaparin or rivaroxaban). Three patients (1.1%) developed VTE postoperatively. There was no significant difference in VTE rates between those prescribed apixaban (1.1%), enoxaparin/rivaroxaban (4.1%), or no anticoagulation (0.5%) (p = 0.28). Four patients (1.4%) developed a postoperative hematoma within 24 hours requiring drainage in the operating room. None of the patients who developed hematomas were on prophylactic apixaban.

Conclusion

Apixaban is safe and effective for VTE prophylaxis after abdominoplasty. Further studies with larger sample sizes and direct comparisons of various anticoagulants are needed to delineate the comparative safety and efficacy profiles.

### Handling delayed or missed direct oral anticoagulant doses: model-informed individual remedial dosing [^9357fa92]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

When the scheduled dose was missed, 3 strategies were evaluated according to previous studies, including taking 1 regular dose, taking a dose 1.5-times the regular dose, or taking a dose double the regular dose at the time of the next scheduled dose. Half of the regular dose could be obtained by breaking the tablet into 2 halves for rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban. However, dabigatran etexilate cannot be broken into halves due to its capsule formulation. However, there are 3 dose specifications for dabigatran etexilate (75, 110, and 150 mg), which could support its remedial dose selection.

The strategies with the least deviation times were considered optimal. For those strategies with approximate deviation time (< 0.2 hour and 0.1 hour for once every 24-hour and 12-hour dosing regimens, respectively), they were considered as equivalent. Moreover, the deviation time for each remedial dosing strategy was estimated and compared with that recommended by the EHRA guidelines.

It was assumed that patients who were administered DOACs with complete adherence reached a steady state before the occurrence of missing or delayed doses. The recommendation is evaluated for a typical older patient with normal renal function, who was not taking any concomitant medications that might potentially cause drug-drug interactions. The dosing regimens are detailed in supplemental Appendix 1.

For full adherence and various nonadherence scenarios, the concentration-time and PD biomarker-time profiles of 1000 virtual patients were simulated based on the identified population PK/PD models. Because the behaviors of exact complete adherence and delayed dosing were simulated without any noticeable "noise", the model parameters were set to the reported values, with the exception of the residual unexplained variability that was set to 0.1% for the proportional error and 0.1 mg/L for the additive error. Simulations and plots were performed using rxode2 (version 2.1.2) and ggplot2 (version 3.5.1) in R (version 4.2.2).

Impact of clinical characteristics on remedial dosing regimens

The factors reported to significantly influence the PK and PD behaviors of DOACs were investigated for their impact on remedial regimens by sensitivity analysis. For continuous variables, the common range within the study population was examined. For categorical variables, the corresponding influence was evaluated. On each occasion, 2000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed in R using rxode2 (version 2.1.2).

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^918d3957]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) anticoagulation when oral therapy is not feasible and management of bleeding — for patients unable to tolerate or take oral medications for a prolonged period post-PCI, the use of a parenteral anticoagulant (AC), such as unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), can be considered within 24 hours of PCI (for those at low bleeding risk) or within 48 to 72 hours of PCI (for those at high bleeding risk), and alternatively, crushed tablets can be considered; for patients who develop major bleeding, appropriate measures should be initiated to control bleeding, and in certain situations, it may be necessary to use appropriate reversal agents to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient.

Figure 1
Cumulative incidence and survival probabilities for outcomes. Cumulative incidence and survival probabilities of prespecified outcomes to 6 months with direct adjustment for all covariates and index year.

When we censored patients after discontinuation of the first assigned medication (as‐treated analysis), we found that the bleeding outcomes still favored apixaban over warfarin (major bleeding HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63–0.89; GI bleeding HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–0.999). However, the rate of intracranial bleeding was not significantly different between the groups. Again, the rates of recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality were not significantly different, though there was a trend toward a lower rate of recurrent VTE in the apixaban group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–1.01) (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 9).

The dosing subgroup exploratory analysis found that treatment with apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in both the 5 mg dosing subgroup (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62–0.93) and 2.5 mg dosing subgroup compared to warfarin (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.85) (Supporting Information: Appendix Tables 10–13). Relative to warfarin, treatment with 5 mg tablets of apixaban (10 mg total daily dose, the approved regimen) was also associated with a lower risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.90) and recurrent VTE (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–0.98). Finally, there was evidence of a lower risk of GI bleeding in the apixaban 2.5 mg subgroup relative to the 5 mg subgroup (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.94). Using direct adjustment for covariates rather than IPTW did not significantly change our findings (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 14).

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: a critical analysis [^dff9b1a8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

FXa Inhibitor‐Specific Coagulation Tests

Calibrated AXA

Rivaroxaban and apixaban showed striking differences in their impact on AXA. For rivaroxaban, calibrated AXA provided excellent diagnostic accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity for concentrations around the 30 ng/mL safe‐for‐treatment threshold. Apixaban had less impact on AXA, and samples with concentrations almost 3‐fold above the threshold were classified as < 30 ng/mL. Hence, our results suggest that calibrated AXA does not provide sufficient sensitivity for the reliable detection of apixaban concentrations > 30 ng/mL. Hints for imprecision of AXA in the low apixaban concentration range can also be derived from an earlier report, which highlighted the strong overall test correlation. 33

This finding puts the current recommendation for apixaban into question to use calibrated AXA to select suitable patients for surgery or thrombolysis. 5, 7

Uncalibrated AXA

If only uncalibrated AXA is available, our results for rivaroxaban suggest that a cut‐off of less than 2 times the ULN can provide the most advantageous balance between sensitivity and specificity: A more restrictive cut‐off (below ULN) did not significantly enhance sensitivity, but lowered specificity considerably. The more liberal < 0.3 U/mL cut‐off produced a higher number of false‐negative results leading to incorrect selection of samples with rivaroxaban concentrations up to 54 ng/mL as eligible for invasive treatment. Similar to the calibrated assays, uncalibrated AXA is of limited value in apixaban‐treated patients. If used, our results suggest that the most restrictive cut‐off (ie, below ULN) should be used to maximize sensitivity and thus patient safety. However, it needs to be acknowledged that even at this cut‐off, 22% of test results below ULN were false negatives (8/36) and our 95% sensitivity target was not met.

### Effective apixaban removal using hemoadsorption during emergent open-heart surgery: a case report and narrative literature review [^b23eb507]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of hemostasis in patients medicated with apixaban (Eliquis) undergoing emergency cardiac surgery is exceedingly difficult. The body's natural elimination pathways for apixaban prove ineffective in emergency situations, and the impact of hemodialysis is limited. The application of Cytosorb ® may attenuate the concentration of apixaban, thereby facilitating the stabilization of these patients.

Case presentation

An 84-year-old man treated with apixaban, underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement surgery due to an acute type A aortic dissection. To address the challenges induced by apixaban, we integrated Cytosorb ® cartridge into the Cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. There was a 63.7% decrease in perioperative apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity. The patient's postoperative course was favourable.

Conclusion

Hemoadsorption with Cytosorb ® may offers a safe and feasible approach for reducing apixaban concentration in emergency cardiac surgery, thereby mitigating the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^90f36195]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Cost Analysis

DOACs have quickly gained popularity as an alternative anticoagulation strategy and surpassed VKAs as first‐line agents because of improved clinical outcomes, simplicity of dosing, lack of monitoring requirements, and expanding indication list. All DOACs are currently branded medications; therefore, cost remains a significant barrier to access. Apixaban was recently granted generic approval at the end of 2019 but product availability (likely not for several more years), cost and generic status of the other DOACs remain unknown. 96 While DOACs are substantially more expensive than VKA, laboratory monitoring costs are reduced since INR monitoring is not required. US cost analyses have shown that apixaban has the highest quality‐adjusted life year for stroke prevention in NVAF patients followed by dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and the lowest being warfarin. 97, 98, 99 A recent study demonstrated that dabigatran was associated with lower all‐cause costs and healthcare resource use compared with rivaroxaban, while having similar all‐cause costs and hospitalizations compared with apixaban, but higher outpatient and pharmacy healthcare resource use. 100

In the United States, commercially insured patients are eligible for time‐limited programs to reduce out‐of‐pocket expense using manufacturer copayment cards (most limiting patient costs to ≤ $10 per month). Federally funded patients (Medicare, Medicaid, etc) are ineligible for these programs (see Table 10). 101 Despite the cost, from 2010 to 2017 there was a dramatic increase in the use of DOACs for NVAF. 7 Analyses have shown that apixaban has become the most prescribed DOAC for NVAF and accounted for approximately half of new DOAC prescriptions by 2017. While the information in Table 10 demonstrates the cash price of DOACs, this does not take into account other factors that need to be considered for enhanced patient care, including clinical outcomes, quality of life, patient preference, and laboratory monitoring costs.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

- age greater than or equal to 80 years

- body weight less than or equal to 60 kg

- serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with apixaban tablets did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of apixaban tablets at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with apixaban tablets did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A new generation of oral direct anticoagulants [^898509f2]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

After more than 50 years of thrombosis treatment and prophylaxis being based on heparin and vitamin K antagonists, a new generation of oral, direct anticoagulants is now available. The past 5 years have brought a strikingly large number of trials that evaluated these new oral anticoagulants in a range of clinical trials, particularly nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, thrombosis prophylaxis after major joint replacement surgery, treatment of venous thromboembolic events, and, most recently, acute coronary syndrome. These studies have been notably similar in design between the drugs for specific indication. This review focuses on the 3 drugs that either have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (dabigatran and rivaroxaban) or have the most mature phase III clinical data (apixaban).

### Relative bioavailability of apixaban solution or crushed tablet formulations administered by mouth or nasogastric tube in healthy subjects [^054daa77]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Crushed tablet and solution formulations of apixaban administered orally or via a nasogastric tube (NGT) may be useful in patients unable to swallow solid dose formulations. It is important to understand whether new formulations and/or methods of administration impact apixaban bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. These studies evaluated the relative bioavailability (Frel) of apixaban solution administered orally; oral solution administered via NGT flushed with either 5% dextrose in water (D5W) or with infant formula; oral solution via NGT with a nutritional supplement; and crushed tablet suspended in D5W and administered via NGT.

Methods

Three open-label, randomized, crossover studies were conducted in healthy adults (study 1: apixaban 10-mg tablet versus oral solution, both administered PO; study 2: apixaban 5-mg oral solution PO versus oral solution via NGT flushed with either D5W or infant formula; study 3: apixaban 5-mg oral solution PO versus apixaban 5-mg oral solution via NGT with a nutritional supplement and versus crushed tablet suspended in D5W and administered via NGT). Point estimates and 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs; test/reference) were generated for Cmax and AUC. Adverse events were recorded throughout each study.

Findings

Frel of the oral solution was 105% versus tablet, and Frel for oral solution via NGT with D5W flush, infant formula flush, nutritional supplement, and crushed tablet via NGT versus oral solution administration were 96.7%, 92.2%, 81.3%, and 95.1%, respectively. The 90% CIs of the GMRs of all AUCs met the bioequivalence criterion except that of the nutritional supplement (0.766–0.863). The corresponding GMRs for Cmax were 0.977, 0.953, 0.805, 0.682, and 0.884. For the solution via NGT flushed with D5W and for the crushed tablet, the 90% CIs of the Cmax GMRs met the bioequivalence criterion. Apixaban was well tolerated in all 3 studies; most adverse events were mild.

Implications

Comparable Frel was observed for oral apixaban solution, tablet, NGT administration of solution flushed with D5W and infant formula, and NGT administration of crushed tablet suspension. Exposure was less when oral solution was administered via NGT with nutritional supplement. These results support several alternative methods of administering apixaban that may be useful in certain clinical situations. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02034565, NCT02034578, and NCT02034591.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^2ce9be29]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 4). The mean age of individuals in the apixaban and warfarin cohorts was 59.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 15.1 years) and 58.3 (SD 15.2). The apixaban and warfarin cohorts were 45.9% and 44.6% White, respectively, and were 55.3% and 54.1% female (Table 1). The dialysis modality at the index date was hemodialysis for 93.8% and peritoneal dialysis for 6.2%. The groups were similar even prior to weighting and were very well‐matched after weighting (Table 2). The proportion of apixaban users in the study population increased markedly during the study period from 2% in 2014 to 47% in 2018 (Supporting Information: Appendix Figure 2). Half of the patients in the apixaban cohort filled prescriptions exclusively for 5 mg tablets (50.0%), while 40.5% exclusively filled 2.5 mg tablets and 9.5% filled a combination of the two tablet strengths. The mean daily dose per patient for apixaban users was 6.7 mg (SD 3.0 mg).

### Effective apixaban removal using hemoadsorption during emergent open-heart surgery: a case report and narrative literature review [^cff69187]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of hemostasis in patients medicated with apixaban (Eliquis) undergoing emergency cardiac surgery is exceedingly difficult. The body's natural elimination pathways for apixaban prove ineffective in emergency situations, and the impact of hemodialysis is limited. The application of Cytosorb ® may attenuate the concentration of apixaban, thereby facilitating the stabilization of these patients.

Case Presentation

An 84-year-old man treated with apixaban, underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement surgery due to an acute type A aortic dissection. To address the challenges induced by apixaban, we integrated Cytosorb ® cartridge into the Cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. There was a 63.7% decrease in perioperative apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity. The patient's postoperative course was favourable.

Conclusion

Hemoadsorption with Cytosorb ® may offers a safe and feasible approach for reducing apixaban concentration in emergency cardiac surgery, thereby mitigating the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation anticoagulant dosing — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) adjustments are detailed as follows: Apixaban 5 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 2.5 mg orally twice daily if at least 2 of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, actual body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. Dabigatran 150 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 75 mg orally twice daily if CrCl is 15–30 mL/min; the FDA has not approved this dose for AF in the United States; in the European label, 110 mg twice daily is recommended for patients age ≥ 80 years and "For consideration" for those ages 75–80 years. Edoxaban 60 mg orally once daily is for CrCl 51–95 mL/min (not recommended if CrCl > 95 mL/min), with dose reduction to 30 mg orally once daily if CrCl is 15–50 mL/min. Rivaroxaban 20 mg orally once daily reduces to 15 mg orally once daily with the evening meal for patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min. When used with antiplatelet therapy (APT), VKA targets INR 2.0–3.0.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism [^7f172606]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The appropriate duration of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have a transient provoking factor (e.g., surgery, trauma, or immobility) and concomitant enduring risk factors is uncertain.

Methods

In this single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, adults with VTE after the occurrence of a transient provoking factor who had at least one enduring risk factor and had completed at least 3 months of anticoagulation were assigned to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the first symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the first episode of major bleeding according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.

Results

A total of 600 patients underwent randomization (mean age, 59.5 years; female sex, 57.0%; non-White race, 19.2%). The trial population had a broad range of provoking factors and enduring risk factors. Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 4 of the 300 patients (1.3%) in the apixaban group and in 30 of the 300 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 1 patient in the apixaban group and none in the placebo group. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in 14 of 294 patients (4.8%) in the apixaban group and in 5 of 294 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96 to 7.43; P = 0.06). One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no deaths attributed to cardiovascular or hemorrhagic causes. Nonhemorrhagic, nonfatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients (2.0%) in each group.

Conclusions

Among patients with provoked VTE and enduring risk factors, low-intensity therapy with apixaban for 12 months resulted in a lower risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE than placebo, with a low risk of major bleeding.

### Apixaban versus no anticoagulation for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma (PREVAPIX-ALL): a phase 3, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^5d93d011]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism resulting in increased mortality and morbidity. We hypothesised that apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, would safely reduce venous thromboembolism in this patient population.

Methods

PREVAPIX-ALL was a phase 3, open-label, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 74 paediatric hospitals in 9 countries. Participants aged 1 year or older to younger than 18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B cell or T cell) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (B cell or T cell immunophenotype) and a central venous line in place throughout induction were randomly assigned 1:1 to standard of care (SOC, ie, no systemic anticoagulation) or weight-adjusted twice-daily apixaban during induction. Randomisation was performed centrally and stratified by age (those < 10 years or those ≥ 10 years). Participants weighing 35 kg or less were administered 2·5 mg twice daily of apixaban as a 2·5 mg tablet, 0·5 mg tablets, or 0·4 mg/mL oral solution, while those weighing more than 35 kg were administered weight-adjusted prophylactic doses using 0·5 mg tablets or the 0·4 mg/mL oral solution twice daily. Primary outcomes were assessed by a blinded central adjudication committee. The primary efficacy outcome for the intention to treat population was the composite of symptomatic or clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolism, the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, and secondary safety outcomes included clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding. Patients were screened for venous thromboembolism by ultrasound and echocardiogram at the end of induction. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02369653) and is now complete.

Findings

Between Oct 22, 2015, and June 4, 2021, 512 participants were randomly assigned and included in analyses (222 [43%] female and 290 [57%] male; 388 [76%] White, 52 [10%] Asian, 24 [5%] Black or African American, and 48 [9%] other races; and 122 [24%] Hispanic or Latino ethnicity). During a median follow-up period of 27 days (IQR 26–28), 31 (12%) of 256 patients on apixaban had a composite venous thromboembolism compared with 45 (18%) of 256 participants receiving SOC (relative risk [RR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·45–1·05; p = 0·080). Two major bleeding events occurred in each group (RR 1·0, 95% CI 0·14–7·01; p = 1·0). A higher incidence of CRNM bleeding, primarily grade 1 or 2 epistaxis, occurred in the apixaban group (11 [4%] of 256 participants) compared with the SOC group (3 [1%] of 256; RR 3·67, 95% CI 1·04–12·97, p = 0·030). The most frequent grade 3–5 adverse events in both groups were thrombocytopenia (n = 28 for the apixaban group and n = 20 for the SOC group) or platelet count decreased (n = 49 and n = 45), anaemia (n = 77 and n = 74), febrile neutropenia (n = 27 and n = 20), and neutropenia (n = 16 and n = 17) or neutrophil count decreased (n = 22 and n = 25). Five deaths occurred, which were due to infection (n = 3 in the SOC group), cardiac arrest (n = 1 in apixaban group), and haemorrhagic cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (n = 1 in the SOC group). There was one apixaban-related death (coagulopathy and haemorrhage after cardiac arrest of unknown cause).

Interpretation

PREVAPIX-ALL is, to our knowledge, the first trial assessing primary thromboprophylaxis using a direct oral anticoagulant in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma. No statistically significant treatment benefit was identified in participants receiving apixaban. Major and CRNM bleeding were infrequent overall, but a higher incidence of CRNM bleeding (primarily epistaxis in younger children) occurred in participants receiving apixaban. For patients deemed to be at particularly high risk of thrombosis, PREVAPIX-ALL provides encouraging safety data for the use of apixaban in clinical settings in which the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risk of bleeding.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^03aa4684]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Future studies might compare the healthcare utilization of an apixaban and warfarin‐based strategy for the ESKD population and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an off‐label, 2.5 mg strategy for part of the VTE treatment course and for patient populations at higher risk for bleeding while on anticoagulants (e.g. those that meet criteria for dose reduction based on AF criteria or patients with a history of anticoagulant‐associated bleeding). Although we did not find any evidence that reduced dosing appears to be useful, dose reduction is not uncommon, and it is possible that in selected patients it leads to better outcomes.

There are several limitations of our study. The USRDS provides extensive information on Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries with ESKD, and because the vast majority of patients with ESKD, including those under the age of 65, have Medicare as their primary payer, this data set includes nearly all Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries with ESKD. However, it does not include claims from individuals in a Medicare Advantage plan. Thus, this population was not included in our analysis. We have no reason to suspect that these individuals would have different responses to anticoagulants than the included patients, although there may be demographic differences.

Additionally, USRDS (and the Medicare claims data that are included) does not provide information on what medications patients received during hospitalizations. Thus, we cannot characterize or control for initial anticoagulation, such as parenteral heparin products, during an index hospitalization. We suspect that the majority of patients in the warfarin cohort received an unfractionated heparin infusion as this is a standard of care in patients with ESKD. It is possible that many apixaban‐treated patients also received unfractionated heparin. Relatedly, we cannot say with certainty whether patients in the apixaban cohort received the recommended loading dose of 10 mg twice per day for the first 7 days of treatment due to the nature of medication claims data and the fact that there is not a 10 mg tablet (but instead patients take two 5 mg tablets, for a total dose of 10 mg twice per day during the loading period). Also, given our definition of recurrent VTE, any subsequent VTE events that occurred during a prolonged index hospitalization would not be included in the analysis. More generally, claims‐based definitions for VTE have been noted to have relatively low positive predictive values.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^30a5dc67]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**:
- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it's converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
- The indication for use includes four options: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), or Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis.

- **Computation**:
- For **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**:
- The dosage is tailored based on three criteria:

- Age of 80 years or older.
- Weight of 60 kg or less.
- Creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less.
- If a patient meets two or more of these criteria, the dosage is reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily. A note explains the reason for dosage reduction.
- If fewer than two criteria are met, the standard dosage is 5 mg twice daily.

- For **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** and **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**:
- An initial higher dose of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days is recommended, followed by 5 mg twice daily. This regimen is aimed at acute treatment. A note provides context on the dosing strategy.

- For **Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis**:
- The suggested dose is 2.5 mg twice daily, with a note indicating its purpose in preventing thrombosis after surgery.

- **Output**:
- The calculator returns the determined apixaban dosage accompanied by relevant notes if applicable. These notes provide critical context for clinical decision-making, clarifying the reasoning behind dosage adjustments based on patient characteristics and treatment indications.

The structured assessment assures the apixaban dosage is well-suited to the patient's needs, adhering to clinical guidelines and ensuring safety and efficacy aligning with their health condition.

### Apixaban dose in patients with atrial Fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from AUGUSTUS [^be1d5348]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and patient sample

The design, rationale, and results of AUGUSTUS have been published. AUGUSTUS was an open-label, prospective, multicenter, 2×2 factorial design clinical trial that compared apixaban with a VKA and aspirin with placebo in patients with AF who had a recent ACS and/or underwent PCI. The trial enrolled 4,614 patients who were ≥ 18 years of age with a history of persistent, permanent, or paroxysmal AF with planned long-term use of an oral anticoagulant; recent ACS and/or PCI; and planned use of a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria included use of oral anticoagulation for any other condition (eg, prosthetic valves, venous thromboembolism, and mitral stenosis); severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min); history of intracranial hemorrhage; recent or planned coronary artery bypass graft surgery; coagulopathy or current bleeding; and contraindication to a VKA, apixaban, P2Y12 inhibitors, or aspirin. Patients were followed for 6 months. The study was approved by the individual site's Institutional Review Board or a central Institutional Review Board. Patients signed an informed consent upon enrollment into the original clinical trial.

Randomization and interventions

Patients were randomized to receive open-label apixaban or VKA and blinded aspirin or matching placebo within 14 days after having an ACS and/or undergoing PCI. Randomization was stratified according to ACS or elective PCI at enrollment.

Apixaban dose was determined by investigators according to the apixaban label. The suggested apixaban dosing was 5.0 mg twice daily or 2.5 mg twice daily if patients had ≥ 2 of the following criteria: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). Patients randomized to VKA had the dose adjusted to reach a target international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. For the comparison of aspirin with placebo, patients received aspirin 81 mg or matching placebo once daily. The treatment duration for all regimens was 6 months, during which the use of other anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, unfractionated heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparins) was prohibited.

### The new era of anticoagulation [^329d9003]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medical use as an anticoagulant for more than 60 years. Although it has been an effective anticoagulant, its use is accompanied by several pitfalls, which has led to research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and do not require monitoring. More data are accumulating to support their use in the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. This article reviews the literature on these novel anticoagulants, including their pharmacokinetics and treatment indications.

### Dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-daily rivaroxaban and twice-daily apixaban: a randomized crossover study [^bd7c9d52]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials In this crossover study the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban were compared. Healthy volunteers received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Rivaroxaban was associated with more prolonged inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban. Rivaroxaban induced a clear prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.

Summary

Background The anticoagulant actions of the oral direct activated factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have not previously been directly compared. Objectives To compare directly the steady-state pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban at doses approved for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods Twenty-four healthy Caucasian male volunteers were included in this open-label, two-period crossover, phase 1 study (EudraCT number: 2015-002612-32). Volunteers were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before they received the other treatment. Plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects were measured at steady state and after drug discontinuation. Results Overall exposure was similar for both drugs: the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for the 0-24-h interval was 1830 μg h L -1 for rivaroxaban and 1860 μg h L -1 for apixaban. Rivaroxaban was associated with greater inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential (geometric mean area under the curve relative to baseline during the 0-24-h interval: 15.5 h versus 17.5 h) and a more pronounced maximal prolongation relative to baseline of prothrombin time (PT) (1.66-fold versus 1.14-fold) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (1.43-fold versus 1.16-fold) at steady state than apixaban. Conclusions Despite similar exposure to both drugs, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was associated with greater and more sustained inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Sensitive PT and APTT assays can be used to estimate the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban.
