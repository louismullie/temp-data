## Question

What are the scarbossa criteria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Sgarbossa criteria, including their original formulation, the Smith-modified update, the Barcelona algorithm, performance characteristics, guideline context, and practical application in LBBB and paced rhythms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why these criteria were developed. Then, I should verify the original Sgarbossa criteria and scoring. Next, I will examine the Smith-modified discordance rule and its rationale. After that, I should review the Barcelona algorithm and its performance claims. Then, I will compare diagnostic performance across methods and reconcile discrepancies. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and outline a practical, stepwise approach for clinicians, including pitfalls and when to escalate care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the historical context. Diagnosing acute coronary occlusion in the presence of left bundle branch block is notoriously difficult because LBBB itself produces repolarization abnormalities that can mimic or mask ischemia; historically, new LBBB was treated as a STEMI equivalent, but that approach led to many false positives and unnecessary cath lab activations, prompting the development of more specific ECG criteria and a shift toward the occlusion MI paradigm that prioritizes angiographic occlusion over ECG labels [^1166UAYr] [^112iexX8].

> I will now examine the original Sgarbossa criteria. Wait, let me verify the exact components and scoring. The original Sgarbossa algorithm assigns 5 points for concordant ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm in leads with a positive QRS, 3 points for concordant ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm in leads V1–V3, and 2 points for excessively discordant ST-segment elevation of at least 5 mm in leads with a negative QRS; a total score of 3 or more is considered positive and highly specific for acute MI in LBBB, though sensitivity is limited [^111RxXRt] [^111mtigj].

> Hold on, I should verify the performance characteristics of the original criteria. Meta-analytic data show that a Sgarbossa score of 3 or more has excellent specificity around 98% but low sensitivity around 20%, which means a positive result strongly supports MI but a negative result cannot exclude it. This trade-off is clinically important and explains why many occlusions are missed when relying solely on the original score [^111mtigj] [^113CU2YY].

> Next, I should review the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria. Let me think about the key change: instead of an absolute 5 mm discordant ST elevation, Smith replaced it with a proportional criterion requiring at least 1 mm discordant ST elevation and an ST/S-wave ratio of −0.25 or less, which improves sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. Importantly, the modified criteria are often applied as an unweighted rule in which any single positive component is considered diagnostic, which is operationally simpler in the ED [^113vSZxE] [^114Kq8gj].

> I need to check the validation data for the modified criteria. Multiple studies show the modified rule increases sensitivity to roughly 80–91% with specificity around 90–99%, outperforming the original weighted score. For example, a validation study found 80% sensitivity and 99% specificity, and a derivation study reported 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity, supporting the proportional discordance approach in LBBB [^112q8PjH] [^114cW8ip].

> Let me consider the Barcelona algorithm next. The Barcelona approach introduces two major enhancements: extend concordant ST depression to any lead, not just V1–V3, and consider disproportionate discordant ST deviation of at least 1 mm in leads where the maximal QRS amplitude (R or S) is 6 mm or less; this leverages the observation that ischemia in LBBB often involves low-voltage leads and yields markedly higher sensitivity with preserved specificity in derivation and validation cohorts [^112SfuzZ] [^1137cBCT].

> I should double-check the claimed performance of Barcelona. Reports indicate sensitivity around 93–95% with specificity around 89–94%, and importantly, a high negative predictive value near 96–97%, suggesting that a negative Barcelona result substantially lowers the probability of AMI. However, I need to emphasize that external validation beyond the originating cohorts remains limited, so cautious adoption with clinical correlation is prudent [^112SfuzZ] [^1137cBCT] [^1141d9ju].

> Now, let me compare and reconcile the methods. The original Sgarbossa criteria are highly specific but insensitive, the Smith-modified criteria improve sensitivity with a modest specificity trade-off, and the Barcelona algorithm maximizes sensitivity and NPV at the cost of slightly lower specificity. Clinically, this means Sgarbossa remains a strong rule-in tool, whereas Barcelona offers a better rule-out strategy, and the Smith modification balances both to some extent, though it still misses a meaningful minority of occlusions [^111mtigj] [^114cW8ip] [^1137cBCT].

> Next, I should review guideline context to ensure alignment. Contemporary ACC expert consensus advises that new LBBB is no longer a STEMI equivalent and recommends integrating Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria with clinical assessment; patients with ischemic symptoms and LBBB who meet these criteria should be managed like STEMI, and those without concordant changes should still undergo risk stratification and serial troponins rather than immediate cath lab activation [^1157HKGQ] [^11533YaH] [^114NydyH].

> I will now examine application to ventricular paced rhythms. Let me verify whether the modified Sgarbossa criteria translate to paced rhythms. Multiple studies and case series suggest the Smith-modified criteria retain good sensitivity and specificity for occlusion MI in paced rhythms, with sensitivity around 81% and specificity around 96%, supporting their use when paced morphology mimics LBBB, though clinicians should remain aware of the evidence base being smaller than in LBBB [^116opEeW] [^116zgkNA] [^114zcKhN].

> But wait, what about echocardiography in LBBB with suspected ischemia. I initially thought bedside echo could reliably distinguish new from old wall motion abnormalities, but I should correct that assumption; recent data show limited diagnostic utility of standard echocardiography in stable LBBB patients with suspected AMI because many have preexisting LBBB and prior infarcts, making new ischemia hard to discern, so echo should not be used in isolation to decide on reperfusion in this context [^112K7f8h].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm LBBB or paced rhythm and assess pretest probability with symptoms, troponin trajectory, and prior ECGs. Second, apply Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria, recognizing that concordant ST changes are most specific and that proportional discordance improves sensitivity. Third, if Barcelona is available and externally validated locally, consider it as a sensitive rule-out adjunct. Fourth, integrate high-sensitivity troponin protocols and clinical risk scores. Finally, escalate to emergent angiography for positive ECG criteria, ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, or rising troponins despite negative ECG algorithms, consistent with ACC guidance [^1157HKGQ] [^11533YaH] [^114NydyH].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and pitfalls. All ECG algorithms in LBBB have imperfect sensitivity, so a negative score does not exclude occlusion; small to moderate MIs may be missed, and false positives can occur in structural heart disease or low QRS voltage states, which is why serial troponins, clinical judgment, and, when available, advanced ECG interpretation or multidisciplinary review remain essential parts of decision-making [^111mtigj] [^112iexX8] [^113Voswm].

> In summary, the Sgarbossa and modified Sgarbossa criteria provide specific, ECG-based signals of occlusion MI in LBBB and paced rhythms, with the Smith modification improving sensitivity via proportional discordance, while the Barcelona algorithm further increases sensitivity and NPV at the expense of some specificity. Contemporary guidelines endorse using these criteria alongside troponins and clinical assessment rather than relying on LBBB alone to trigger reperfusion, aligning with the modern occlusion MI paradigm [^114Kq8gj] [^1137cBCT] [^11533YaH].

The Sgarbossa criteria are ECG-based rules for diagnosing **acute myocardial infarction (AMI)** in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular paced rhythm, where standard STEMI criteria are unreliable [^1157HKGQ]. The original criteria assign points for concordant ST elevation, concordant ST depression in V1–V3, and excessively discordant ST elevation; a score ≥ 3 is highly specific (98%) but poorly sensitive (20%) for AMI [^111mtigj]. The modified Sgarbossa criteria replace the absolute 5 mm discordant ST elevation with a proportional rule: discordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm with **ST/S ratio ≤ −0.25**, which improves sensitivity to ~80% while maintaining high specificity (~99%) [^112q8PjH]. These criteria should be applied when LBBB or paced rhythm is present with ischemic symptoms; a positive result supports emergent reperfusion, but a negative result **does not exclude AMI**, so clinical judgment and troponins remain essential [^11533YaH].

---

## Original Sgarbossa criteria

The original Sgarbossa criteria comprise three ECG findings, each weighted by specificity:

| **Criterion** | **Description** | **Points** |
|-|-|-|
| Concordant ST elevation | ≥ 1 mm ST elevation in leads with a positive QRS complex (concordant with QRS polarity) | 5 |
| Concordant ST depression | ≥ 1 mm ST depression in leads V1–V3 (concordant with QRS polarity) | 3 |
| Excessively discordant ST elevation | ≥ 5 mm ST elevation discordant with QRS polarity (i.e. ST elevation in leads with negative QRS) | 2 |

---

A total score ≥ 3 indicates a high likelihood of AMI, with specificity around 98% but sensitivity only about 20% [^111mtigj].

---

## Modified Sgarbossa criteria

The modified Sgarbossa criteria replace the absolute 5 mm discordant ST elevation with a proportional rule to improve sensitivity [^114cW8ip]:

- **Concordant ST elevation**: ≥ 1 mm ST elevation in leads with positive QRS (unchanged).
- **Concordant ST depression**: ≥ 1 mm ST depression in leads V1–V3 (unchanged).
- **Proportional discordant ST elevation**: ≥ 1 mm ST elevation discordant with QRS polarity, with ST/S-wave amplitude ratio ≤ −0.25 (new).

This modification increases sensitivity to ~80% while maintaining high specificity (~99%) [^112q8PjH].

---

## Clinical application and limitations

- **Clinical context**: Apply when LBBB or paced rhythm is present with ischemic symptoms.
- **Positive criteria**: Any of the above findings strongly suggest AMI and warrant emergent reperfusion.
- **Limitations**: Low sensitivity means a negative Sgarbossa score does not exclude AMI; use clinical judgment and troponins [^112K7f8h].

---

## Comparison with other ECG criteria

The Barcelona algorithm, a newer approach, uses low-voltage QRS (max R/S ≤ 6 mm) with discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm and reports higher sensitivity (~93%) and specificity (~94%) than the original or modified Sgarbossa criteria [^112SfuzZ]. However, it requires external validation before widespread adoption [^1141d9ju].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current ACC/AHA guidelines endorse the Sgarbossa and modified Sgarbossa criteria for diagnosing AMI in LBBB or paced rhythm, emphasizing their specificity and the need for clinical correlation [^1157HKGQ] [^11533YaH].

---

The Sgarbossa criteria are a specific, clinically useful tool for diagnosing AMI in LBBB or paced rhythm, with the modified version improving sensitivity; they should be integrated with clinical judgment and troponins to guide reperfusion decisions.

### Latin American consensus: children born small for gestational age [^112iwNrR]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Definition of SGA

The definition of SGA is unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines children born SGA or after intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) as those with birth weight below the 10th percentile of the recommended gender-specific birth weight for referenced gestational age. Where gestational age is not available, the birth weight of < 2500 g should be considered low birth weight. This definition is also used in obstetrics and neonatal guidelines due to the fact that these children represent groups with the highest neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, neonates with either low birth weight or length — or both — for gestational age should be considered SGA.

For the purpose of this consensus, an SGA child is a child whose birth weight and/or birth length is at least 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for its gestational age.

Notably, we recommend that the term SGA not be used as a synonym for IUGR. The term IUGR refers to insufficient growth of the fetus and should only be used if at least 2 assessments of intrauterine growth are available and the fetus is not growing appropriately. SGA refers to body size — a low weight and/or length for a known gestational age — and is preferred in the absence of information about fetal growth.

6.4.4 Description of commonly available charts

The 10th percentile curves of some of the charts described above are compared in Figure 2. The Hadlock chart (1991), one of the most commonly used growth charts, is an ultrasound‐based standard. It is based on a cohort of 392 low‐risk, primarily white women from Texas. The Alexander chart (1996) is based on over 3 million singleton live births in the USA and is included as an example of a birth weight‐based reference to illustrate their limitation, which is the underestimation of optimal fetal growth during the preterm period.

The goal of the Intergrowth‐21st project (2014) was to develop a universal ultrasound‐based prescriptive growth chart. This was a prospective longitudinal study of 4321 low‐risk women from eight centers located in eight high‐ and middle‐income countries. 194 The study had strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure that participants were not exposed to environmental factors known to affect fetal growth, and it therefore aimed to reflect optimal fetal growth. Based on predetermined criteria, the authors concluded that the differences between participants from different countries in measures of skeletal growth (crown–rump length and head circumference) were similar enough to justify pooling the data, and they therefore generated a single universal chart. No information was provided on the differences between countries with respect to measures such as fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference, which are used in clinical practice to detect FGR and are known to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Interestingly, there were considerable differences in birth weight between infants from different countries, even in this highly selected group of women free from the negative influence of environmental factors known to affect fetal growth. For example, the mean birth weight at term in India was 2.9 kg, which was approximately 600 g lower than the mean birth weight in the UK (3.5 kg). 195 These differences have led some to question the validity of the pooled chart and of the hypothesis that underlies the Intergrowth‐21st project. 205, 206 As demonstrated in Figure 2, the 10th percentile of the Intergrowth‐21st chart is significantly lower throughout gestation than most other ultrasound‐based standards.

### Using wisely: a reminder on the proper use of the American Geriatrics Society beers criteria ® [^115Q6kPd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria — key principles for proper use emphasize that medications listed are "potentially inappropriate, not definitely inappropriate", and inclusion reflects "an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms for most older adults in some types of situations and clinical circumstances; however, in some circumstances the medications included in the AGS Beers Criteria can be appropriate for older adults". Clinicians are advised to "read the rationale and recommendations statements for each criterion. The caveats and guidance listed there are important", to "understand why medications are included in the AGS Beers Criteria, and adjust your approach to those medications accordingly", and to apply the criteria by "identifying potentially inappropriate medications and where appropriate offering safer nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies". The criteria "should be a starting point for a comprehensive process of identifying and improving medication appropriateness and safety", and "access to medications included in the AGS Beers Criteria should not be excessively restricted by prior authorization and/or health plan coverage policies". The document notes that "the AGS Beers Criteria are not equally applicable to all countries", and references the existence of "seven key principles" to guide use.

### Evaluation of T-Wave morphology in patients with left bundle branch block and suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112GZfoq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

T-wave morphology in the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB) has been proposed as an indicator of myocardial ischemia.

Objectives

We sought to identify T-wave morphology findings in patients with LBBB that predict non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We hypothesized that two or more contiguous leads with concordant T waves would be predictive of NSTEMI.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study performed by chart review in a tertiary care center emergency department. We identified a consecutive cohort who presented with LBBB and symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Exclusion criteria were diastolic blood pressure > 120 mm Hg, heart rate > 130 beats/min, positive pressure ventilation, potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, and cardiac arrest without prearrest electrocardiogram (ECG) available. We collected ECGs and classified T waves into five categories based on morphology, blinded to clinical outcome. Clinical outcome data were collected blinded to ECG findings. Those with ECG diagnostic of STEMI by modified Sgarbossa criteria were excluded from the primary analysis, which was sensitivity and specificity of two or more contiguous leads with concordant T waves for NSTEMI.

Results

There were 246 patients included. Mean age was 73 years; 160 (65%) were female, and 32 had myocardial infarction. Thirty percent had two or more contiguous precordial leads with partially or completely concordant T waves. For NSTEMI, the sensitivity and specificity of this finding were 19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8–37) and 68% (95% CI 61–74).

Conclusions

We found no clinically useful relationship between T-wave concordance and myocardial infarction in our patient population. Future investigation of LBBB T-wave morphology should focus on alternative populations and findings.

### Interobserver agreement in the electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112Umcds]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the interobserver agreement between cardiologists and emergency physicians in the ECG diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) using the ECG algorithm previously described by Sgarbossa et al.

Methods

Using the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm, 4 cardiologists and 4 emergency physicians independently interpreted a test set of 224 ECGs with LBBB, of which 100 ECGs were from patients with an evolving AMI. A subset of 25 ECGs was reinterpreted by each reader to test intraobserver agreement for AMI as well as interobserver agreement for the degree of ST-segment deviation. Agreement rates for AMI were estimated using the kappa statistic. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing AMI were determined for each reader, using the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO I) enzyme criteria for AMI as the gold standard. The study was conducted at 3 university-affiliated medical centers. The test set contained ECGs from 100 patients enrolled in the GUSTO I trial with LBBB on their initial ECG and an evolving AMI confirmed by serum cardiac enzyme changes, and 124 control patients from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease who had stable, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and LBBB.

Results

There was excellent interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80 to 0.83) between cardiologists and emergency physicians for diagnosing AMI. Intraobserver agreement kappa values for AMI diagnosis by cardiologists and emergency physicians were 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.94) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.89). The median sensitivity for diagnosing AMI by cardiologists and emergency physicians was 73% (range 66% to 80%) versus 67% (range 61% to 75%); median specificity was 98% (range 97% to 99%) versus 99% (range 98% to 99%). Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the degree of ST-segment deviation in all 12 leads was 0.86 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.87) among all readers.

Conclusion

There is excellent interobserver agreement between cardiologists and emergency physicians for diagnosing AMI when applying the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm to patients with LBBB. Emergency physicians should be able to reliably use this algorithm when evaluating patients.

### Late outcomes of patients with prehospital ST-segment elevation and appropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory nonactivation [^116kxQGj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of prehospital CCL activations were independently classified by authors (A.F. and O.G.) according to clinical presentation and ECG findings, blinded to the outcome of angiography. Inappropriate CCL nonactivations were defined in patients with all of the following: (1) cardiac ischemic symptoms (< 12 hours), (2) STEMI ECG criteria or equivalents, and (3) absence of contraindications to emergency angiography. STEMI equivalents were defined as any of the following: (1) left bundle‐branch block (new, presumed new or preexisting with Sgarbossa concordance), (2) posterior MI, (3) left main coronary artery ischemia, and (4) return of spontaneous circulation following witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest from a shockable rhythm.

Diagnoses were independently adjudicated by authors (A.F. and O.G.) according to the 4th UDMIand classified as (1) MI, (2) acute myocardial injury, (3) chronic myocardial injury, and (4) no myocardial injury. In addition, MI was diagnosed in the presence of (1) symptoms or signs of cardiac ischemia and a single troponin T result > 52 ng/L for the fifth‐generation assay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana)or > 0.03 ng/mL for the fourth‐generation assay (Roche Diagnostics), and (2) symptoms or signs of cardiac ischemia and death before troponin testing or within 24 hours of a single elevated troponin T result. The fourth‐generation troponin T assay was used until June 15, 2011 (99th percentile upper reference limit ≥ 0.01 ng/mL), and thereafter, the fifth‐generation (high sensitivity) troponin T assay (99th percentile upper reference limit ≥ 14 ng/L). Peak troponin T levels were divided by the upper reference limits to facilitate comparison between fourth‐generation and high‐sensitivity assays.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^1137cBCT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Diagnostic performance and receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction using discordantdeviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with a low‐voltage.

We show the results of the best cutoffs for the max (R|S) voltage used to define low‐voltage, in the derivation and in the validation cohort separately.

We tested several ECG algorithms incorporating the new criteria (Table 4). The best performance and the highest sensitivity were obtained by the algorithm that provided the most comprehensive approach to repolarization abnormalities in LBBB and included concordant ST deviation > 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead and discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). This algorithm was named BARCELONA algorithm and is described in detail in Table 5.

Table 5
Definition of the BARCELONA Algorithm to Diagnose AMI in the Presence of LBBB

The BARCELONA algorithm attained the highest sensitivity (95%), significantly higher (P < 0.01) than Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules, as well as the highest negative predictive value (97%), while maintaining 89% specificity (Table 3 and Table 6). The global performance of the BARCELONA algorithm was significantly better than previous algorithms: It achieved the highest efficiency (91%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.92), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the ones obtained by the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Figure 6). The BARCELONA algorithm also afforded a significant improvement in the ability to predict the occurrence of an AMI, as shown by Integrated Discrimination Improvement and Net Reclassification Improvement indexes (both indexes showed P < 0.01 comparing BARCELONA algorithm with Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules).

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^111PJjQe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Applicability

Di Marco et al 1 point out that, in their cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, 63% unnecessarily underwent cardiac catheterization, no doubt in keeping with recommended guidelines, although the Sgarbossa criteria, with a specificity of 96%, were available, having been established in 1996. As the authors point out, the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines 11 advise that in a patient with a clinical suspicion of ongoing ischemic symptoms, an ECG showing LBBB should be regarded as an ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction equivalent, even if there was a previous ECG showing LBBB. These guidelines also emphasized that the presence of a (presumed) new LBBB does not predict a myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, if the new criteria can be externally validated, they could on occasion be a valuable aid in decision making.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^114YMds6]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Current diagnostic criteria are very rigid and define patients with more severe or established CRPS, both in the clinic and for research purposes. Patients with lesser or earlier CRPS are not captured by these criteria yet early diagnosis and treatment seem the logical way to progress in order to achieve better outcomes. New criteria acknowledging CRPS as a spectrum diagnosis are needed.

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^115K8exP]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Improvements in ultrasonographic imaging provide a tool for estimating placental volume using three‐ and four‐dimensional scanning techniques. Placental volume has been proposed as a marker for various obstetric complications related to defective placental function, including FGR. 117, 118 A systematic review estimating the value of first‐trimester 3D placental volume for the prediction of SGA found a detection rate of 24.7% at a 10% false‐positive rate. 119 Another parameter is the placental quotient, defined as the ratio of the placental volume to the fetal crown–rump length. The placental quotient was reported to have a high negative predictive value for perinatal complications but was not very useful when used for screening of SGA in a low‐risk population, with a sensitivity of 27.1%. 120 The discriminatory ability of placental volume alone for SGA appears to be modest, but may be integrated into a multivariable screening model. However, the use of 3D placental volume as a routine screening tool for FGR is limited by the need for proper equipment and training required to obtain these measurements in a reproducible manner.

5.4 Prediction models

Currently there is no single screening test sufficiently predictive of FGR to recommend routine clinical use. Investigations are underway to combine various tests, but such prediction models have not been sufficiently validated in terms of outcomes studies and therefore must be considered investigative protocols at this time. In a prospective cohort of 4970 women, the combination of first‐trimester maternal serum PAPP‐A, beta hCG, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Doppler performed in the first trimester had a detection rate of 73% for early SGA (< 34 weeks) but only 32% for late SGA (≥ 34 weeks). 19 A different model that included maternal characteristics, first‐trimester blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, PlGF, and sFlt‐1 was evaluated in a larger cohort of 9150 women and achieved a detection rate of 86% for early‐onset FGR and 66% for late‐onset FGR, both at a false‐positive rate of 10%. 19, 121 In the second trimester, the SCOPE consortium examined 5606 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and found that the combination of clinical risk factors, 15‐week biomarkers (53 biomarkers were used), and 20‐week ultrasound (fetal biometry and Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries) had only a moderate detection rate for SGA below the 10th percentile, with a positive predictive value of 32% and a negative predictive value of 91%. 122

5.3 Ultrasound markers

Several ultrasound‐based markers have been shown to be predictive of FGR, including uterine artery Doppler, placental morphology, and placental volumes. However, given their modest predictive accuracy, they cannot be recommended for universal screening for FGR.

Increased uterine artery resistance largely reflects a failure of extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries and is associated with the development of pre‐eclampsia and FGR due to maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta. 107

First‐ and second‐trimester abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, defined as mean pulsatility index above the 95th percentile, have been shown to be associated with FGR. 108, 109, 110 In a large prospective cohort study of 4610 nulliparous women, uterine artery pulsatility index at 11 +0 to 13 +6 weeks predicted 60% of preterm and 17% of term SGA infants at a false‐positive rate of 10%. 111 Although uterine artery Doppler shows promise, especially for the prediction of early‐onset FGR, current evidence does not support routine screening with uterine artery Doppler for FGR in low‐ or high‐risk pregnancies. 112

Sonographic evaluation of the placenta is a routine part of the obstetric ultrasound examination. A method for systematic two‐dimensional (2D) placental ultrasound examination has been described, often in combination with other parameters 30, 113, 114 Abnormal placental morphology is defined by placental dimensions, shape, texture, and cord insertion. Placental shape is considered abnormal when the placental thickness is above 4 cm or greater than 50% of placental length. Placental texture is defined as normal when it is homogenous, and abnormal when the placenta is heterogeneous and contains multiple echogenic cystic lesions or has a jelly‐like appearance with turbulent uteroplacental flow. 115, 116 Placental cord insertion is defined as central (> 2 cm from placental disc margin), marginal (within 2 cm of margin), or velamentous (inserting into the surrounding membranes). 114 In a cohort of 60 high‐risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler, women with abnormal placental shape at 19–23 weeks had higher odds of FGR (OR 4.7) than women with normal placental shape. 108 However, the use of 2D placental imaging has significant limitations, including difficulty in assessing nonanterior placentas and a wide variability in the morphology of normal placentas. Furthermore, there are no large‐scale prospective studies validating the use of this modality for prediction of FGR. 114

ECG Analysis in the Derivation Cohort

The Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules showed a high specificity (up to 98% for Sgarbossa score ≥ 3) but a low sensitivity (range, 26%–62%) for the diagnosis of AMI in the presence of LBBB (Table 3).

Table 3
Diagnostic Performance for AMI of the BARCELONA Algorithm and Previously Proposed Electrocardiographic Algorithms

The Sgarbossa rule of ST depression limited to ECG leads V1 to V3 had a sensitivity of 13%. By extending the analysis to concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any ECG lead the sensitivity increased to 51% (P < 0.01) still maintaining a 97% specificity (Table 4).

Table 4
Performance of New Criteria and Different Algorithms for the Diagnosis of AMI

The best cutoff value of max (R|S) voltage indicating low‐voltage QRS with disproportionate discordant ST deviation was 6 mm (0.6 mV). This max (R|S) voltage gave the highest efficiency (86%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.84), significantly higher than other values (Figure 5). Thus, the new criterion was positive in the presence of discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any ECG lead with a max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). Of note, in line with previous studies, 7 patients with AMI had lower QRS voltage (mean max [R|S] voltage 9.6 mm or 0.96 mV versus 10.8 mm or 0.108 mV; P = 0.01) and the median number of leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) was higher in patients with AMI (5 versus 3; P = 0.02).

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^11269rMG]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of SGA and Intrauterine Growth Retardation

SGA describes neonates born with a birth weight and/or length below the normal range for gestational age. Although the terms intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and SGA are often used as synonyms, they are not interchangeable. IUGR refers to inappropriate gain in estimated fetal weight and abdominal circumference during a certain period of gestation based on 2 ultrasound measurements, irrespective of the size at birth. Most but not all infants with IUGR may be born SGA, depending on timing and severity of the intrauterine insult. Conversely, many SGA infants will have not experienced IUGR. IUGR tends to cause a relatively large head and length relative to birth weight.

The definition of SGA requires knowledge of gestational age, precise anthropometric measurements at birth, and appropriate reference data for birth weight and birth length. Country- or ethnic-specific normative data are important for identifying those at risk. The most commonly used reference data on birth size are derived from charts developed by Usher and McLean or Niklasson, which have been used in large studies on SGA. Alternatively, the Intergrowth-21 birth weight and length standards can be used to identify SGA. We recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate for the region and ethnic-specific population. Neonates can be subclassified into SGA for weight, SGA for length, or SGA for both weight and length. Neonates born SGA with a small head circumference should be identified, as this may point to specific etiologies. These subclassifications may help in understanding the mechanisms and implications of being born SGA.

In the previous consensus statement published in 2007, SGA was uniformly defined as a birth weight and/or length below −2.0 standard deviation scores (SDS) for gestational age. Although this definition is arbitrary, knowing that the long-term consequences of being born SGA are likely graded rather than binary, we recommend keeping the same definition of SGA as being born with birth weight and/or length below −2 SDS for gestational age according to national reference standards, since this definition identifies children at high risk of short adult stature.

Recommendation: 1.000000000000000e+00 For accurate classification of SGA, we recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate ones for the region- and ethnic-specific population. (A +++)

Acute coronary occlusion — posterior MI and LBBB context: Emergent coronary angiography should be performed when there is a high suspicion for acute posterior MI; the presence of a new LBBB is no longer considered a STEMI equivalent; the Sgarbossa criteria are specific, although not sensitive; a modification using an ST/T-wave ratio improved sensitivity from 52% to 91% with similar specificity; for those meeting the Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria, treatment should be similar to those with STEMI; and emergent echocardiography can be performed when there is an LBBB and suspicion for ischemia/infarction.

### Consensus based definition of growth restriction in the newborn [^115EqQgw]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus definition of growth restriction in the newborn that can be used clinically to identify newborn infants at risk and in research to harmonize reporting and definition in the current absence of a gold standard.

Study Design

An international panel of pediatric leaders in the field of neonatal growth were invited to participate in an electronic Delphi procedure using standardized methods and predefined consensus rules. Responses were fed back at group-level and the list of participants was provided. Nonresponders were excluded from subsequent rounds. In the first round, variables were scored on a 5-point Likert scale; in subsequent rounds, inclusion of variables and cut-offs were determined with a 70% level of agreement. In the final round participants selected the ultimate algorithm.

Results

In total, 57 experts participated in the first round; 79% completed the procedure. Consensus was reached on the following definition: birth weight less than the third percentile, or 3 out of the following: birth weight < 10th percentile; head circumference < 10th percentile; length < 10th percentile; prenatal diagnosis of fetal growth restriction; and maternal pregnancy information.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on a definition for growth restriction in the newborn. This definition recognizes that infants with birth weights < 10th percentile may not be growth restricted and that infants with birth weights > 10th percentile can be growth restricted. This definition can be adopted in clinical practice and in clinical trials to better focus on newborns at risk, and is complementary to the previously determined definition of fetal growth restriction.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113sHMYg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiographic Diagnosis of AMI in the Presence of LBBB

Our results show that concordant ST deviations are extremely specific for AMI. This was already known for concordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) (Sgarbossa score 5) but had not been demonstrated for concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead. As described in Table 1 in their manuscript, 4 Sgarbossa and colleagues analyzed the ST‐segment concordance or discordance with QRS polarity only for ST elevation. By contrast, they evaluated the presence of ST depression in any lead without correlating it with QRS polarity. They found that ST depression in leads V1 to V3 was suggestive of AMI, since leads V1 to V3 generally display a negative QRS in patients with LBBB. However, such analysis without correlating ST depression with QRS polarity could miss the clinical relevance of concordant ST deviations occurring in those ECG leads that can have either a negative or a positive QRS in different patients with LBBB. In our series, when concordant ST depression was present, it occurred in leads other than V1 to V3 in the vast majority of patients with AMI, and these patients would have been missed by the Sgarbossa rules. Thus, we confirmed the hypothesis that by evaluating concordant ST depression in any lead, we could improve the sensitivity of the ECG to detect ischemia in different myocardial regions.

In patients with LBBB, it has been demonstrated that acute ischemia is associated with an increase in the magnitude of ST deviations discordant with QRS polarity 7, 13 so that they become disproportionately greater than would be expected by the voltage of the QRS in the corresponding lead. By using a new approach, we could identify a max (R|S) voltage of 6 mm (0.6 mV) as the best cutoff for disproportionate discordant ST deviations ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) suggestive of AMI.

The BARCELONA algorithm incorporated a comprehensive approach to repolarization abnormalities in patients with LBBB by including concordant ST deviations ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead and discordant ST deviations in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). This algorithm significantly improved the sensitivity of the ECG to diagnose AMI in patients with LBBB, achieving similar results to those obtained by the ECG in patients without LBBB. 14 It also had a high negative predictive value: When the algorithm is negative, the probability of AMI seems very low.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: is It feasible? [^113Voswm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Many patients presenting with LBBB have underlying cardiomyopathies (ischemic or nonischemic). Many may present with symptoms compatible with ACS (shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, hypotension) and could have elevation in cardiac troponin levels. Yet, many could have type‐2 AMIs because of supply‐demand mismatch or even nonischemic myocardial injury. A large number of patients with advanced cardiomyopathy have small amplitude QRS and therefore there is a concern that using the Barcelona algorithm, overdiagnosis of STEMI equivalent could be frequent if applied to patients with LBBB presenting with acute heart failure exacerbation. On the other hand, using the Smith modification allows for exclusion of patients with LBBB and left ventricular hypertrophy who have an absolute magnitude of discordant ST segment deviation in leads with large amplitude QRS complexes.

A major issue of the previously mentioned studies, including a study by Nestelberger et al, is the definition of the end point. As mentioned, Sgarbossa et al tested their ECG criteria for identifying patients with creatine kinase MB elevation (not limited to STEMI equivalent), whereas the Barcelona algorithm was tested against relatively lower magnitude of cardiac troponin elevation, which would include virtually all patients with AMI, not just those with OMI. The same holds for the Nestelberger study. In contrast, Smith et al used a much higher threshold of cardiac troponin elevation that probably restricted the "positive" to patients with true STEMI equivalence.

Search results and included studies

Figure 1 summarises the search results and included studies. A total 4176 studies were identified from electronic databases and two related studies known to the authors were manually added. After removing 1725 duplicates, there were 2452 studies identified for title and abstract screening. A total of 54 studies were included in the full-text review; of these, eight authors were contacted for additional information. Of the authors who were contacted, two were contacted to seek clarification in the methodology used to identify the incidence of HAM, and six were contacted for additional data to extract the incidence of HAM. Four studies were excluded from this review as additional data were not provided by the authors.

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1), published between 2000–2021 and conducted in Australia (n = 7), Europe (n = 2), North America (n = 2) and South America (n = 1).

Study design and study quality

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies, of which eight were undertaken in the acute care setting, three in subacute, and one across both acute and subacute combined. All 12 studies were observational; of these, two were retrospective clinical audits and ten were prospective cohort studies. Using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research, seven of the ten studies were rated positive, two neutral, and three negative (Table 2).

### Utility of echocardiography in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and left bundle-branch block [^112K7f8h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

These findings have important and immediate clinical consequences, as they falsified the assumption underlying our hypothesis regarding the utility of echocardiography in patients with suspected AMI and LBBB as recommended in current guidelines. As these data were derived from large international diagnostic studies using central adjudication by independent cardiologists, their validity and generalizability seem high. These surprising findings seem well explained by 3 aspects. First, in most patients presenting with LBBB and AMI, LBBB is pre‐existing (known or unknown) and not the consequence of the current AMI. Second, many patients with LBBB have prior AMIs resulting in persistent WMA, which often cannot be reliably differentiated from new WMA related to a new AMI. Third, most AMIs in patients with LBBB are small to moderate in size, and not the catastrophic very large AMI phenotype resulting in LBBB as a consequence of the very large ischemic territory. As only a subgroup of patients with LBBB underwent transthoracic echocardiography in the ED, it is important to highlight that selection bias would be expected to have favored a positive finding.

Accordingly, an integrated triage algorithm including specific ECG criteria (Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria) with high specificity, as well as high sensitivity cardiac troponin/I concentrations at presentation and their 0/1‐hour or 0/2‐hour changes should be used in the selection of patients for immediate and/or early coronary angiography. It is important to highlight that these findings only apply to patients stable enough to provide written informed consent, which was required for this study. They should not be extrapolated to patients after cardiac arrest or in cardiogenic shock, for which immediate echocardiography should definitely remain the standard of care.

In conclusion, in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected AMI and LBBB, standard echocardiographic assessment provides only limited diagnostic value regarding the presence or absence of AMI.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^114cW8ip]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Sgarbossa's rule, proposed for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, has had suboptimal diagnostic utility. We hypothesize that a revised rule, in which the third Sgarbossa component (excessively discordant ST-segment elevation as defined by ≥ 5 mm of ST-segment elevation in the setting of a negative QRS) is replaced by one defined proportionally by ST-segment elevation to S-wave depth (ST/S ratio), will have better diagnostic utility for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent, using documented coronary occlusion on angiography as reference standard.

Methods

We collected admission ECGs for all patients with an acutely occluded coronary artery and left bundle branch block at 3 institutions. The ECGs of emergency department patients with chest pain or dyspnea and left bundle branch block, but without coronary occlusion, were used as controls. The R or S wave, whichever was most prominent, and ST segments, relative to the PR segment, were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The ST/S ratio was calculated for each lead that has both discordant ST deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm and an R or S wave of opposite polarity; others were set to 0. The cut point for the most negative ST/S ratio with at least 90% specificity was determined. The revised rule is unweighted, requiring just 1 of 3 criteria. Diagnostic utilities of the original and revised Sgarbossa rules were computed and compared. McNemar's test was used to compare sensitivities and specificities.

Results

The study and control groups included 33 and 129 ECGs, respectively. The cut point selected for relative discordant ST-segment elevation was -0.25. Excessive absolute discordant ST-segment elevation of 5 mm was present in at least one lead in 30% of ECGs in patients with confirmed coronary occlusion versus 9% of the control group, whereas excessive relative discordant ST-segment elevation less than -0.25 was present in 79% vs. 9%. Sensitivity of the revised rule in which ST-segment elevation with an ST/S ratio less than or equal to -0.25 replaces ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm was significantly greater than either the weighted (P < .001) or unweighted (P = .008) Sgarbossa rule: 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76% to 98%) versus 52% (95% CI 34% to 69%) versus 67% (95% CI 48% to 82%). Specificity of the revised rule was lower than that of the weighted rule (P = .002) and similar to that of the unweighted rule (P = 1.0): 90% (95% CI 83% to 95%) versus 98% (95% CI 93% to 100%) versus 90% (95% CI 83% to 95%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios for the revised rule were 9.0 (95% CI 8.0 to 10) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.3). The revised rule was significantly more accurate than both the weighted (16% difference; 95% CI 5% to 27%) and unweighted (12% difference; 95% CI 2% to 22%) Sgarbossa rules.

Conclusion

Replacement of the absolute ST-elevation measurement of greater than or equal to 5 mm in the third component of the Sgarbossa rule with an ST/S ratio less than -0.25 greatly improves diagnostic utility of the rule for STEMI. An unweighted rule using this criterion resulted in excellent prediction for acute coronary occlusion.

### The left bundle-branch block puzzle in the 2013 ST-elevation myocardial infarction guideline: from falsely declaring emergency to denying reperfusion in a high-risk population. are the sgarbossa criteria ready for prime time? [^1166UAYr]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt and accurate identification of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the presence of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) remains difficult. The 2004 STEMI guideline recommended emergent reperfusion therapy to patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB. These recommendations have led to frequent false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy because most patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB do not have acute coronary artery occlusion on angiography. The new 2013 STEMI guideline makes a drastic change by removing previous recommendations. Therefore, patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB would no longer be treated as STEMI equivalent. The new guideline fails to recognize that some patients with suspected ischemia and LBBB do have STEMI, and denying reperfusion therapy could be fatal. The Sgarbossa electrocardiography criteria are the most validated tool to aid in the diagnosis of STEMI in the presence of LBBB. A Sgarbossa score of ≥ 3 has a superb specificity (98%) and positive predictive value for acute myocardial infarction and angiography-confirmed acute coronary occlusion. Thus, we propose a diagnosis and triage algorithm incorporating the Sgarbossa criteria to quickly and accurately identify, among patients presenting with chest pain and new or presumably new LBBB, those with acute coronary artery occlusion. This is a high-risk population in which reperfusion therapy would be denied by the 2013 STEMI guideline. Our algorithm will also significantly reduce false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy, the inevitable consequence of the 2004 STEMI guideline.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^111j7a9L]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Literature

A search of electronic databases and communication with the European Pathways Association revealed three 'sentinel' articles that described the characteristics of a clinical pathway: Campbell et al. De Bleser et al. and Vanhaecht et al. De Bleser et al. surveyed the multiple terms used to describe a clinical pathway via a comprehensive review of the literature and derived key characteristics in attempting to address international confusion regarding the definition of a clinical pathway. Campbell et al. described clinical pathways in the context of their relationship to clinical guidelines, whilst Vanhaecht et al. summarised previous studies to determine whether their review of audit tools elicited common characteristics of clinical pathways. A summary of the characteristics identified by these studies is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of clinical pathways derived from sentinel articles

Criteria

The following five criteria were derived from the three sentinel articles mentioned above: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression (that is, steps were taken if designated criteria were met); and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population.

Level of agreement and final criteria

These criteria were tested by three of the team on five papers. If the intervention described in the paper met all five criteria then it was considered a clinical pathway. This resulted in agreement between reviewers on only two out of the five papers. It was apparent that the main obstacle to agreement on all five criteria was the poor reporting of the intervention. To address this issue the criteria were unchanged but their relative importance was adjusted. An intervention was defined as a clinical pathway if it was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care and at least three of the remaining four criteria were met (that is, it met the first criteria and any three of the remaining four). This amended schedule of essential criteria was then tested by applying them to a further five papers. Following the application of the amended schedule of criteria, there was 100% agreement between the three review authors regarding whether an intervention was a clinical pathway. This schedule was then adopted by the review group and applied to studies identified by the search strategy for the systematic review.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1125juYM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of ECG Findings

Two cardiologists at each participating center evaluated all ECGs; these cardiologists were blinded to both the coronary angiography findings and the time elapsed between the ROSC and the ECG acquisition. In case of doubtful interpretation, a third cardiologist was asked to provide an additional interpretation. The rhythm, heart rate, QRS duration, corrected QT value, intraventricular conduction, arrhythmias, and segments with ST elevation (anterior, lateral, posterior, inferior, and right) were analyzed for each ECG. In addition, each ECG was categorized as either diagnostic or not diagnostic of STEMI according to the criteria of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of STEMI recommended by the 2017 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction. The isolated ST-segment depression in leads V1 to V3 was considered diagnostic of posterior STEMI without the need of confirmation by the posterior leads, considering the clinical picture of a resuscitated patients with OHCA. The criteria proposed by Sgarbossa et alwere considered in the presence of a left bundle branch block.

Evaluation of Coronary Angiography Findings

For patients who had undergone coronary angiography, we assessed the presence of significant coronary stenosis, the number of vessels in which stenosis was present, and the execution of any PTCA by analyzing the procedure report. If the report was not exhaustive, an interventional cardiologist who was blinded to the patient's post-ROSC ECG was asked to evaluate the coronary angiography. Coronary artery stenosis was defined as significant if it was greater than 50% for the left main coronary artery and greater than or equal to 75% for the other coronary vessels.

Definitions

On the basis of the post-ROSC ECG and coronary angiography findings, the study population was divided into 4 groups. Those with true-positive ECG findings were patients who had post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria and had obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA confirmed by angiography. Patients with true-negative ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that did not meet STEMI criteria and did not have obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA confirmed by angiography. Patients with false-positive ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but did not have obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA by angiography. Patients with false-negative ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that did not meet STEMI criteria but who had obstructive coronary artery disease that was worthy of PTCA on angiography.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^113vSZxE]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified Sgarbossa's criteria for MI in left bundle branch block" for ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a pre-existing left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular paced rhythm. This calculator is particularly useful in the emergency department setting where rapid diagnosis of MI is critical.

The Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria applies to patients presenting with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of MI who have an ECG showing LBBB or a ventricular paced rhythm. These ECG patterns can make it difficult to diagnose MI using standard criteria, hence the need for the Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of MI in this specific patient population, which can guide appropriate treatment and management decisions.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria. However, it should be noted that this calculator is not intended to replace clinical judgment and should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

The Modified Sgarbossa's criteria calculator evaluates the likelihood of a myocardial infarction (MI) in the context of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) by examining three critical electrocardiographic features. By reviewing each feature and applying a defined scoring system, it offers a systematic way to assess the presence of MI.

Here's how it works:

1. **ST elevation ≥ 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex in at least one lead**:
	- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
	- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

2. **ST depression ≥ 1 mm in lead V1, V2, or V3**:
	- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
	- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

3. **Excessively discordant ST deviation**:
	- This feature is identified based on an ST/S ratio in any lead showing > 1 mm ST-segment elevation or depression.
	- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
	- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

After evaluating these inputs, the calculator sums the points to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 3. A higher total score suggests a stronger indication of MI.

Interpretation of the score is straightforward:

- A score of 1 or more supports the criteria for myocardial infarction, highlighting an increased probability of MI when LBBB is present.
- A score of 0 indicates that the criteria for myocardial infarction are not met, implying a lower likelihood of MI given the context.

This systematic approach aids healthcare professionals in making informed clinical decisions about potential coronary events in patients with complex ECG patterns due to LBBB.

### Body surface mapping improves early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain and left bundle branch block [^111eHgju]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To test prospectively depolarisation and repolarisation body surface maps (BSMs) for mirror image reversal, which is less susceptible to artefact, in patients with acute ischaemic-type chest pain, and to compare these BSM criteria with previously published 12 lead ECG criteria.

Methods

An 80 lead portable BSM system was used to map patients presenting with acute ischaemic-type chest pain and a 12 lead ECG with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was defined by serial cardiac enzymes. Each 12 lead ECG was assessed by the criteria of Sgarbossa et al and Hands et al for diagnosis of AMI. Depolarisation and repolarisation BSMs were assessed for loss of mirror image reversal of QRS with ST-T isointegral map patterns and a change in vector angle from QRS to ST-T outside 180 ± 15 degrees -findings typically seen in LBBB with AMI.

Results

Of 56 patients with chest pain and LBBB, 18 had enzymatically confirmed AMI. Patients with loss of BSM image reversal were significantly more likely to have AMI (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 16.4, p = 0.007). Loss of BSM image reversal was significantly more sensitive (67%) for AMI than either 12 lead ECG method (17%, 33%) albeit with some loss in specificity (BSM 71%, 12 lead ECG 87%, 97%). Patients with AMI compared with those without AMI had a greater mean change in vector angle outside the normal range (180 ± 15 degrees), particularly between QRS isointegral and ST60 isopotential (the potential 60 ms after the J point at each electrode site) BSMs (19 degrees v 9 degrees, p = 0.038). Loss of image reversal and QRS-ST60 vector change outside 180 ± 15 degrees had 61% sensitivity and 82% specificity for AMI (odds ratio 7.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 24.4, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

BSM compared with the 12 lead ECG improved the early diagnosis of AMI in the presence of LBBB.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^1141d9ju]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Further Studies

The high sensitivity and specificity of the new Barcelona algorithm require to be assessed in an independent population, either manually or with automated techniques. It sometimes happens that criteria developed in one center do not perform so well when evaluated in another center. On the other hand, it could be argued that the established Sgarbossa criteria performed similarly in the Barcelona validation sample as in the original study. 2 Nevertheless, few ECG criteria have been shown through the years to be the order of 93% to 94% sensitive and specific and only time will tell whether the outstanding performance of the criteria set out in the article of Di Marco et al 1 will stand the test of independent assessment.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^1158pzAV]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Classification approach in spondyloarthritis

More than ten years ago, ASAS developed classification criteria for axial and peripheral SpA that were intended to replace older sets of SpA criteria such as Amor and the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria. The ASAS criteria for axial SpA cover both non-radiographic and radiographic axial SpA (ankylosing spondylitis) and have, therefore, potential to replace also the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis.

It is important to emphasize that classification criteria are not intended for use in clinical practice for the primary diagnostic purpose (the diagnosis should be already established) and should not be considered synonymous with diagnostic criteria.

The starting point of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA is the presence of chronic back pain (duration > 3 months) and onset of back pain before the age of 45 (Fig. 1A). Patients can meet the criteria either via the imaging arm or the clinical arm. The imaging arm requires the presence of sacroiliitis (radiographic — according to the modified New York criteria or MRI — according to the ASAS definition) in conjunction with at least one typical SpA parameter. The clinical arm was originally intended for situations when imaging is not available. The criteria are met if the HLA-B27 is positive and at least two other SpA parameters are present. The overall sensitivity of the criteria is 82.9%, the specificity: 84.4%, with the imaging arm performing slightly better (sensitivity: 66.2%, specificity: 97.3%) than the clinical arm (sensitivity: 56.6%, specificity: 83.3%). Recently, ASAS and the North American Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) started a new study (Classification of Axial Spondyloarthritis Inception Cohort – CLASSIC) aimed at validation and possibly improvement of the specificity of the ASAS classification criteria. 1

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^116gz4he]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and Specificity

All the measurements in this study were made manually. In their supplementary data, the authors give an example where approximation of a measurement could lead to a different interpretation of one of the modified Sgarbossa criteria, depending on whether approximation of ST depression was 0.15 or 0.2 mV. This is because the ratio |STj/Samp| was involved. In the new Barcelona criteria, no ratios are involved. However, a similar situation must arise where the amplitude of an R or S wave could be 0.62 mV when measured by computer but a manual estimate measuring to the nearest 0.05 mV could be 0.6 mV. In the latter case, this wave would meet one of the Barcelona thresholds, being ≤ 0.6 mV, whereas the automated measurement would not. Of course, it could be argued development of the criteria is based on manual measurements and therefore application would also apply to manual measurements but clearly there is scope for variation here, as in any manual versus automated ECG measurement.

The authors performed a separate assessment of specificity on 214 hospital patients without any evidence of an AMI and who had not undergone cardiac catheterization. Specificity of the Barcelona criteria remained high at 90%, although this was the lowest specificity of all criteria.

Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the new criteria is the fact that discordant ST depression in V6, for example, can be regarded as a positive indicator of myocardial infarction if the R‐wave amplitude is ≤ 0.6 mV. This criterion had a surprisingly high specificity of 94%, even when assessed together with concordant ST elevation.

For this reason, the author made a rapid review of 50 cases of LBBB selected at random from a local database of several hundred thousand ECGs recorded mainly in a hospital setting. Time did not permit analysis of a larger sample. However, it was found that 94% of examples had a maximum R or S wave ≤ 0.6 mV in ≥ 1 lead. There is therefore scope for checking the new Barcelona criterion of significant discordant ST deviation.

It should also be noted that in Fig. 2, the R amplitude in V5 is approximately 0.5 mV and the STj depression exceeds 0.1 mV and so the Barcelona algorithm is positive.

### Peripheral spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis: are we dealing with semantics or clinically meaningful differences? [^1158SyQV]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Also, the performance of the different sets of criteria was evaluated in the multinational COMOSPA study that comprised 3942 patients diagnosed by the rheumatologist. Although the performance status of ASAS and CASPAR criteria might not be reliable since most patients presented with symptoms of axSpA, the potential of overlap between both sets of criteria was significant. In fact, 12.3% of the cohort fulfilled the ASAS pSpA criteria, and 21.6% fulfilled the CASPAR criteria. Also, 62% of patients satisfying the ASAS pSpA criteria fulfilled the CASPAR criteria simultaneously. The authors concluded that by satisfying multiple sets of criteria, the cohesion of the SpA group is maintained and that most rheumatologists worldwide picture SpA as a unique entity of similar conditions.

In another study including 100 patients attending a psoriasis dermatology clinic,17% of the patients fulfilled both CASPAR and ASAS pSpA classification criteria. The duration of psoriasis and the prevalence of nail involvement (88% vs 49%) were higher in patients who met CASPAR criteria compared with those without arthritis.

Although classification criteria are helpful to better characterise diseases after clinical diagnosis, the distinction between pSpA and PsA sine psoriase based on these criteria may be viewed as artificial, because of a potential circular analysis bias. In the absence of an appropriate biomarker for either disease, we are compelled to use the imperfect classification criteria, which may be validated against the physician's opinion (diagnosis), the current gold standard to define a disease. Nevertheless, these classification criteria need to be validated in large and diverse cohorts whenever this is possible. Ultimately, it should always be highlighted that any classification criteria, although providing a framework for the identification of individual patients, should be differentiated from diagnostic criteria to avoid misdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment. Diagnostic criteria for pSpA and PsA have not been validated. The classification criteria define the diseases for the purpose of enrolling patients in clinical trials and provide guidance to clinicians, yet the definitive diagnosis should be based on the rheumatologist's evaluation.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^111SnnQS]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2015 Beers Criteria — detailed guidance emphasizes nuanced application: "Key Principle 1: Medications in the AGS 2015 Beers Criteria are potentially inappropriate, not definitely inappropriate", and "There is a common misperception that any use of a medication in the Beers Criteria is considered inappropriate. This is not correct". The criteria list medicines "generally best avoided in older adults because they are ineffective or pose unnecessarily high risk for harms", yet "there are some older adults in whom use of these medications is appropriate", so they merit scrutiny but are not universally inappropriate. Users should "Read the rationale and recommendations statements for each criterion. The caveats and guidance listed there are important", and "clinical judgment is required", since "a drug that the criteria consider "potentially inappropriate" may not always be a bad choice" and "just because a medication is subject to an exemption (or not included in the criteria at all) does not automatically mean it is a good choice". It is "important not only to know that a medication is included on the Beers list, but also to know why", which "should be used to guide decision-making", because "The risks of AGS 2015 Beers Criteria medications vary with the situation of each individual", for example a medication that "increases risk of falls may be especially unsafe in an individual already at high risk of falls". Optimal application includes identifying PIMs and "offering safer nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies"; "Prior versions of the Beers Criteria have not offered alternatives", and "The AGS and AGS 2015 Beers Criteria Expert Panel are working on developing these lists of alternative therapies". Finally, the criteria "capture only a small percentage of the total burden of medication-related problems in older adults" and "work best when used as a starting point to review and discuss an individual's entire medication regimen".

### Expanding the estimated fetal weight definition of growth restriction by adding small abdominal circumference: prediction of neonatal morbidity [^111rMTUq]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Out of the 2802 individuals in the NICHD Fetal Growth Study (including 8661 protocol scans), 2400 were eligible to be included in this analysis (Figure 1) and all of these were live births. Of the 2400 eligible, 181 (7.5%) were diagnosed with FGR by the original definition, with an additional 34 (total 215, 9.0%) diagnosed with FGR by the expanded definition (P < .001), a 19% relative increase. Selected characteristics of the total and both FGR populations are displayed in Table 1. The mean gestational age at the ultrasound included in the analysis was 36.9 ± 2.3 weeks. The mean gestational age at delivery in the cohort was 39.3 ± 1.4 weeks. At birth, 135 infants (5.6%) experienced composite neonatal morbidity, and 245 infants (10%) were classified as SGA.

### Infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening: a systematic review [^113tvAWX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Neonatal hypoglycemia is common, occurring in up to 50% of infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infant of diabetic mother [IDM], small for gestational age [SGA], large for gestational age [LGA], and preterm) and is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Guidelines recommend screening infants at risk of hypoglycemia. The proportion of infants who require screening for neonatal hypoglycemia is unknown.

Objective

To determine the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening using criteria from the highest-scoring critically appraised clinical guideline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify clinical practice guidelines for neonatal hypoglycemia and took place at a tertiary maternity hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible guidelines were critically appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Using screening criteria extracted from the highest-scoring guideline, the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening was determined in a retrospective observational cohort study of infants born January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Infant participants were included if gestational age was 35 weeks or more, birth weight was 2000 g or more, and they were not admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit less than 1 hour after birth. The data were analyzed from November 2022 through February 2023. A total of 101 372 infants met the inclusion criteria.

Exposure

Risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia.

Main Outcome

Proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

Results

The study team screened 2366 abstracts and 18 guidelines met inclusion criteria for appraisal. There was variability in the assessed quality of guidelines and a lack of consensus between screening criteria. The highest-scoring guideline defined screening criteria as: IDM, preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation), SGA (less than 10th percentile), birth weight of less than 2500 g or more than 4500 g, LGA (more than 90th percentile), or gestational age more than 42 weeks. A total of 101 372 infants met criteria for inclusion in the cohort study; median (IQR) gestational age was 39 (38–40) weeks and 51% were male. The overall proportion of infants eligible for screening was 26.3%. There was an increase in the proportion of eligible infants from 25.6% to 28.5% over 15 years, which was not statistically significant after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, and multiple pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–1.03; change in proportion per year).

Conclusion

A systematic review found that practice guidelines providing recommendations for clinical care of neonatal hypoglycemia were of variable quality with is a lack of consensus regarding definitions for infants at risk for hypoglycemia. In the cohort study, one-quarter of infants were eligible for hypoglycemia screening. Further research is required to identify which infants may benefit from neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^117Rv8ct]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

In the study of Di Marco et al, 1 all ECGs were interpreted visually by 2 cardiologists and there was an exceptionally high agreement between them (κ coefficient = 0.98). Measurements > 0.1 mV (1 mm) were made to the nearest 0.05 mV. This does raise the question that if ST amplitude, for example, happened to be bordering on 0.1 mV (eg, 0.095 mV), then it could have possibly influenced a cardiologist aware of a threshold of 0.1 mV. Of course, such a situation could affect both sensitivity and specificity, but it might mean that if automated methods were used for ECG interpretation of a new test set at some future point, the results of automated versus manual interpretation could differ.

The biggest difference between the new criteria and the original Sgarbossa criteria is that the new approach is not a point scoring system. The new criteria of Di Marco et al 1 have 2 major differences compared with previous criteria:
Although the Sgarbossa criteria used ST depression ≥ 0.1 mV as a criterion for AMI only in leads V1 to V3 with a dominant Q or S wave, the new approach extends this criterion to any lead (ie, where the ST depression and the QRS complex are "concordant");
A completely new criterion, applicable in any lead, of ST deviation ≥ 0.1 mV, which is "discordant" with the QRS complex where the dominant QRS wave ≤ 0.6 mV (ie, the STj amplitude is oppositely directed to the dominant QRS deflection). Note that this is not peak to peak QRS amplitude.

These 2 new criteria, together with an existing Sgarbossa criterion (namely, ST elevation ≥ 0.1 mV), which is concordant with the QRS complex, constitute the new so‐called Barcelona algorithm, which is positive if any 1 of the 3 above mentioned criteria is met.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^111RxXRt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Sgarbossa's criteria for MI in left bundle branch block" for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, left bundle branch block and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Sgarbossa's criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) in left bundle branch block is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with acute MI in the presence of a left bundle branch block, a condition that often obscures the electrocardiographic diagnosis of MI. The criteria incorporate three primary components: ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is concordant with the QRS complex, ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in lead V1, V2, or V3, and excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead. These components are used to evaluate the likelihood of an acute MI, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making in patients with left bundle branch block.

The calculator evaluates the likelihood of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a left bundle branch block by analyzing three specific ECG criteria. Here's how the scoring system works:

- If there is ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm that occurs in the same direction as the QRS complex, this contributes 5 points to the total score.
- An ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in ECG leads V1, V2, or V3 adds 3 points.
- If there is any excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead, 2 points are added.

For each criterion that is true, the corresponding points are summed to obtain an overall score. For example, if a patient exhibits both an ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex and excessively discordant ST changes, the total score would be 7, calculated as 5 points for the first criterion plus 2 points for the third one. Should none of the criteria be met, the resulting score would be 0.

The interpretation of the total score helps guide clinical decision-making regarding myocardial infarction:

- A score of less than 3 suggests that a myocardial infarction is unlikely to have occurred.
- A score of 3 or higher indicates that a myocardial infarction is likely.

The calculator outputs a total score ranging from 0 to 10, accompanied by an interpretation to help evaluate the probability of myocardial infarction based on these thresholds.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112zxvhN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) is often challenging. On one hand, most of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) because of the presence of LBBB are not experiencing an AMI. 1 On the other hand, patients with LBBB and AMI are usually at high risk and often experience delays in reperfusion therapy 1 that may lead to critical consequences. 2, 3

Unfortunately, even the most recent electrocardiographic algorithms 4, 5 do not afford a diagnostic certainty for AMI in patients with LBBB. 2, 5, 6 In the absence of acute ischemia, the LBBB pattern is characterized by (1) ST‐segment displacement in the opposite direction to the polarity of the QRS complex (further referred as discordant ST deviation) and (2) the existence of a certain degree of proportionality between the magnitude of the discordant ST deviation and the voltage of the corresponding QRS complex. 4, 5, 7 Thus, in addition to the clinical symptoms of acute ischemia, the occurrence of ST elevation concordant with QRS polarity (5 points in Sgarbossa rules, referred to as concordant ST elevation) and the presence of excessive discordant ST deviation (such as the ST/QRS ratio in the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria) 5 are specific for AMI. However, these criteria have a relatively low sensitivity. 2, 5, 6

The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria® (AGS Beers Criteria®) for Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) Use in Older Adults are widely used by clinicians, educators, researchers, healthcare administrators, and regulators. Since 2011, the AGS has been the steward of the criteria and has produced updates on a 3-year cycle. The AGS Beers Criteria® is an explicit list of PIMs that are typically best avoided by older adults in most circumstances or under specific situations, such as in certain diseases or conditions. For the 2019 update, an interdisciplinary expert panel reviewed the evidence published since the last update (2015) to determine if new criteria should be added or if existing criteria should be removed or undergo changes to their recommendation, rationale, level of evidence, or strength of recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaGrowth disturbances-risk of fetal growth restriction [^116kzQyS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, or an estimated fetal weight of less than the 10th percentile, is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Optimizing management for obtaining the most favorable outcome for mother and fetus is largely based on detailed ultrasound findings. Identifying and performing those ultrasound procedures that are most associated with adverse outcome is necessary for proper patient management. Transabdominal ultrasound is the mainstay of initial management and assessment of fetal growth. For those fetuses that are identified as small for gestational age, assessment of fetal well-being with biophysical profile and Doppler velocimetry provide vital information for differentiating those fetuses that may be compromised and may require delivery and those that are well compensated. Delivery of the pregnancy is primarily based upon the gestational age of the pregnancy and the ultrasound findings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114NydyH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and CDP eligibility — risk classification — states that the absence of ischemic ECG changes identifies patients at relatively lower (although not necessarily low) risk for MI but is not sufficient for excluding ACS; therefore, these patients are appropriate for evaluating using a CDP. All CDPs exclude patients with ischemic ST-segment elevation; however, many do not specifically exclude those with other ECG findings potentially associated with ischemia. We recommend that patients with new ischemic ECG changes should be considered high risk and undergo evaluation and treatment according to current NSTE-ACS guidelines and not be entered into an accelerated CDP. For the purposes of this document, ECGs are classified into 3 groups: STEMI or equivalent; ischemic ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities; and nonischemic, which includes normal, nonspecific findings, left ventricular hypertrophy with or without repolarization ST-T wave changes, and left or right bundle branch block or paced rhythm not meeting Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria for MI.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113CU2YY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To validate ECG criteria previously proposed by Sgarbossa et al for the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and suspected ischemia.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed at an urban teaching hospital. All patients admitted with suspected ischemia and LBBB were eligible. MI was defined as an elevated creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme MB (> 14 IU/L) that was at least 5% of total CK level. ECGs were interpreted by 2 physicians blinded to patient outcome. Interpreters were asked to rate ECGs for the presence of each of the 3 criteria proposed by Sgarbossa et al: (1) ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex; (2) ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm discordant with the QRS complex; and (3) ST-segment depression in leads V(1) through V(3). Interobserver agreement was assessed.

Results

Of 190 eligible patients, 25 (13%) had MI. Sensitivities of the 3 criteria varied from 0 to 16%, with specificities of 93% to 100%. Only the first criterion demonstrated a clinically useful likelihood ratio (positive likelihood ratio = 16 [95% confidence interval 4 to > 100]). Patients with new LBBB were more likely to have MI (relative risk = 5. 1 [95% confidence interval 2.6 to 10]). Interobserver agreement among ECG interpreters ranged from 93% to 98%.

Conclusion

The criteria of Sgarbossa et al cannot be used to exclude MI in patients with LBBB because of low sensitivities and poor negative likelihood ratios. ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex had a high positive likelihood ratio for identification of MI. Patients with new LBBB and suspected ischemia are 5 times more likely to have MI than patients with LBBB of chronic or unknown duration.

### Customized vs INTERGROWTH-21standards for the assessment of birthweight and stillbirth risk at term [^113fktTw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal growth abnormalities are linked to stillbirth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, and use of the correct birthweight standard is essential for accurate assessment of growth status and perinatal risk.

Objective

Two competing, conceptually opposite birthweight standards are currently being implemented internationally: customized gestation-related optimal weight (GROW) and INTERGROWTH-21 st. We wanted to compare their performance when applied to a multiethnic international cohort, and evaluate their usefulness in the assessment of stillbirth risk at term.

Study Design

We analyzed routinely collected maternity data from 10 countries with a total of 1.25 million term pregnancies in their respective main ethnic groups. The 2 standards were applied to determine small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) rates, with associated relative risk and population-attributable risk of stillbirth. The customized standard (GROW) was based on the term optimal weight adjusted for maternal height, weight, parity, and ethnic origin, while INTERGROWTH-21 st was a fixed standard derived from a multiethnic cohort of low-risk pregnancies.

Results

The customized standard showed an average SGA rate of 10.5% (range 10.1–12.7) and LGA rate of 9.5% (range 7.3–9.9) for the set of cohorts. In contrast, there was a wide variation in SGA and LGA rates with INTERGROWTH-21 st, with an average SGA rate of 4.4% (range 3.1–16.8) and LGA rate of 20.6% (range 5.1–27.5). This variation in INTERGROWTH-21 st SGA and LGA rates was correlated closely (R = ± 0.98) to the birthweights predicted for the 10 country cohorts by the customized method to derive term optimal weight, suggesting that they were mostly due to physiological variation in birthweight. Of the 10.5% of cases defined as SGA according to the customized standard, 4.3% were also SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st and had a relative risk of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–4.1) for stillbirth. A further 6.3% (60% of the whole customized SGA) were not SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st, and had a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–4.1) for stillbirth. An additional 0.2% of cases were SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st only, and had no increased risk of stillbirth. At the other end, customized assessment classified 9.5% of births as large for gestational age, most of which (9.0%) were also LGA by the INTERGROWTH-21 st standard. INTERGROWTH-21 st identified a further 11.6% as LGA, which, however, had a reduced risk of stillbirth (relative risk, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–0.7).

Conclusion

Customized assessment resulted in increased identification of small for gestational age and stillbirth risk, while the wide variation in SGA rates using the INTERGROWTH-21 st standard appeared to mostly reflect differences in physiological pregnancy characteristics in the 10 maternity populations.

### A framework for the development and interpretation of different sepsis definitions and clinical criteria [^115JiwrE]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although sepsis was described more than 2,000 years ago, and clinicians still struggle to define it, there is no "gold standard", and multiple competing approaches and terms exist. Challenges include the ever-changing knowledge base that informs our understanding of sepsis, competing views on which aspects of any potential definition are most important, and the tendency of most potential criteria to be distributed in at-risk populations in such a way as to hinder separation into discrete sets of patients. We propose that the development and evaluation of any definition or diagnostic criteria should follow four steps: 1) define the epistemologic underpinning, 2) agree on all relevant terms used to frame the exercise, 3) state the intended purpose for any proposed set of criteria, and 4) adopt a scientific approach to inform on their usefulness with regard to the intended purpose. Usefulness can be measured across six domains: 1) reliability (stability of criteria during retesting, between raters, over time, and across settings), 2) content validity (similar to face validity), 3) construct validity (whether criteria measure what they purport to measure), 4) criterion validity (how new criteria fare compared to standards), 5) measurement burden (cost, safety, and complexity), and 6) timeliness (whether criteria are available concurrent with care decisions). The relative importance of these domains of usefulness depends on the intended purpose, of which there are four broad categories: 1) clinical care, 2) research, 3) surveillance, and 4) quality improvement and audit. This proposed methodologic framework is intended to aid understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, provide a mechanism for explaining differences in epidemiologic estimates generated by different approaches, and guide the development of future definitions and diagnostic criteria.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction in ventricular paced rhythm using the modified sgarbossa criteria [^116opEeW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Ventricular paced rhythm is thought to obscure the electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction. Our primary aim was to compare the sensitivity of the modified Sgarbossa criteria (MSC) to that of the original Sgarbossa criteria for the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction in patients with ventricular paced rhythm.

Methods

In this retrospective case-control investigation, we studied adult patients with ventricular paced rhythm and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome who presented in an emergency manner to 16 international cardiac referral centers between January 2008 and January 2018. The occlusion myocardial infarction group was defined angiographically as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 0 to 1 flow or angiographic evidence of coronary thrombosis and peak cardiac troponin I ≥ 10.0 ng/mL or troponin T ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. There were 2 control groups: the "non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio" group consisted of patients who underwent coronary angiography for presumed type I myocardial infarction but did not meet the definition of occlusion myocardial infarction; the "no occlusion myocardial infarction" control group consisted of randomly selected emergency department patients without occlusion myocardial infarction.

Results

There were 59 occlusion myocardial infarction, 90 non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio, and 102 no occlusion myocardial infarction subjects (mean age, 72.0 years; 168 [66.9%] men). For the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction, the MSC were more sensitive than the original Sgarbossa criteria (sensitivity 81% [95% confidence interval [CI] 69 to 90] versus 56% [95% CI 42 to 69]). Adding concordant ST-depression in V4 to V6 to the MSC yielded 86% (95% CI 75 to 94) sensitivity. For the no occlusion myocardial infarction control group of ED patients, additional test characteristics of MSC and original Sgarbossa criteria, respectively, were as follows: specificity 96% (95% CI 90 to 99) versus 97% (95% CI 92 to 99); negative likelihood ratio (LR) 0.19 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33) versus 0.45 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.65); and positive LR 21 (95% CI 7.9 to 55) versus 19 (95% CI 6.1 to 59). For the non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio control group, additional test characteristics of MSC and original Sgarbossa criteria, respectively, were as follows: specificity 84% (95% CI 76 to 91) versus 90% (95% CI 82 to 95); negative LR 0.22 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.38) versus 0.49 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.66); and positive LR 5.2 (95% CI 3.2 to 8.6) versus 5.6 (95% CI 2.9 to 11).

Conclusion

For the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction in the presence of ventricular paced rhythm, the MSC were more sensitive than the original Sgarbossa criteria; specificity was high for both rules. The MSC may contribute to clinical decisionmaking for patients with ventricular paced rhythm.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^112XneM3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

New definitions from sSepsis-3

Sepsis, severe sepsis and the SOFA score

The 2012 sepsis guidelines defined sepsis as 'the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection'. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as 'a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection'. This new definition highlights the three critical components of sepsis, namely the presence of infection, the abnormal regulation of the host response to infection and the resulting organ system dysfunction as a result of the host response.

One of the most significant changes in the new definitions was the elimination of a defined condition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The SIRS criteria have included temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate more than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute and white blood cell count > 12 000/µL or < 4000/µL or > 10% immature (band) forms. Traditionally, more than two SIRS criteria were felt to represent patients at risk of or suffering from sepsis. The taskforce determined that the inclusion of two SIRS criteria did not provide appropriate discrimination between those suffering sepsis and an appropriate physiological response to insult (infection or otherwise). Likewise, many patients with two or more SIRS criteria never go on to develop an infection or sepsis. Thus, the presence of SIRS criteria has been removed from the definition of sepsis. In addition, the term 'severe sepsis' (previously defined as sepsis accompanied by sepsis-induced organ dysfunction) was removed from the guidelines, as this term is redundant to the 2016 definition of sepsis. This change highlights the taskforce's focus on organ dysfunction as a critical component in the diagnosis of sepsis. The taskforce identified 'life-threatening organ dysfunction' by 'an increase [from baseline] in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more'.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: is It feasible? [^1143skFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Several ECG scores have been suggested for rapid identification of patients with LBBB and STEMI equivalent. The first score was described by Sgarbossa et al, suggesting that concordant ST‐segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead or concordant ST‐segment depression of ≥ 1 mm in leads V1‐V3 is a sign of "transmural" ischemia owing to AMI. Originally tested for identifying AMI (elevated creatine kinase‐MB levels), this score has low sensitivity for detecting OMI (adjudicated by coronary angiography). In the original article they described a third criterion (excessively discordant ST elevation, defined as ≥ 5 mm in leads with negative QRS complexes). This criterion was found to be less predictive and later was modified by Smith et al to adjust the absolute magnitude of the ST elevation to the size of the QRS complex (≥ 1 mm ST elevation with an ST elevation to S‐wave amplitude ratio ≥ 0.25). The reported sensitivity of the modified criteria is higher than that of the original Sgarbossa criteria. More recently, a new modification called the Barcelona criteria, was derived, but not validated, in a large cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 484); however, the outcome criteria for OMI included patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction‐3 flow and peak troponins only 10x the upper reference limit, which includes troponin values that are seen in almost all NSTEMI patients and thus would include almost all non‐OMI. The Barcelona algorithm includes ST deviation > 1 mm concordant with QRS polarity in any ECG lead or ST deviation > 1 mm discordant with QRS polarity; in any lead with maximal QRS (R or S wave) voltage < 6 mm is considered predictive of STEMI equivalent. This algorithm was tested in a relatively large cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 484) and reported better accuracy than the Sgarbossa and Smith criteria. Yet, it has not been validated in an independent cohort. The study included selected patients who were referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, rather than patients who presented with symptoms compatible with ACS to the emergency medical service ambulances or emergency department. The control group included patients with LBBB without clinical suspicion of ACS.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^1112npe1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Voltages in LBBB

The interesting new criterion is the use of a low‐voltage QRS complex together with ST deviation. It therefore is of some interest to consider the vectorcardiogram of LBBB, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2
A 12‐leadand derived vectorcardiogram demonstrating left bundle branch block.

The 3 planes of theare transverse (T), frontal (T), and left sagittal (LS). The 3 orthogonal leads X, Y, and –Z, from which theis constructed, are directed similarly to V6, and V2, respectively.

The classic LBBB pattern has a relatively narrow QRS loop and slow inscription signified by the close spacing of the dots that form the loop. In general terms, the T‐wave loop is oppositely directed from the QRS loop. Leads that are directed essentially parallel to the QRS loop, particularly in the transverse plane (eg, a precordial lead, such as lead V1 or V2), will have a high QRS voltage. Leads that are more directed at right angles to the VCG loop, such as V4 and V5 in this example, will have lower voltages because the component of the electrical activity in these leads is much less than in those leads directed similarly to the main QRS loop. It can be seen in Figure 2 that the voltage in V5 is less than one quarter of the voltage in V1. Thus, it can be expected that there will be a large variation in the amplitude of the QRS complex in ECGs with LBBB. This can also be seen in Figure 1 of the article by Di Marco et al. 1 There is therefore a small probability that evolving ST depression in the left lateral leads from V4, for example, toward V6 in an LBBB recorded from a patient without an AMI could therefore be associated with a low‐voltage QRS complex. This might account for the slightly reduced specificity of 94% in the new Barcelona criteria compared with 99% in the Sgarbossa criteria, but of course sensitivity is exceptionally high in the former at 93% compared with 33% in the latter.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy appropriate use criteria — relationship to guidelines and scope — state that appropriate use criteria "should be considered in concert with the guidelines", and where overlap exists "the ratings are consistent with the guideline recommendations". Generally, scenarios deemed Appropriate or May Be Appropriate "often meet Class I, IIa, or IIb" guideline categories or are otherwise supported. The document highlights that comorbidities can modify decisions — showing how other medical issues "may modify the decision to implant an otherwise indicated or appropriate ICD" — and that described scenarios "should be used as a guide to work in accompaniment with other clinical information". Users are advised to understand these criteria as a "guide", not a list of "do" or "do not do" specifications, and to recognize that not all situations are covered and "should be considered in their unique contexts". It also notes the criteria "may be applied in many ways", including development of decision support or educational tools.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113Yi7uS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

To improve the diagnostic sensitivity of ECG in patients with LBBB and suspected AMI, we have elaborated 2 new approaches. First, since any ST deviation concordant with the QRS should be regarded as abnormal, we hypothesized that not only concordant ST elevation but also concordant ST depression might be a sign of AMI; we therefore extended the Sgarbossa rule of concordant ST depression in leads V1 to V3 to any other lead. It was hypothesized that this would cover the electrocardiographic projection of acute ischemia in different myocardial regions.

Second, we considered as a positive criterion for AMI the presence of an appreciable (≥ 1 mm or 0.1 mV) discordant ST deviation in low‐voltage QRS complexes because, in the absence of ischemia, these complexes usually show isoelectric ST‐segment potentials (Figure 1). This latter criterion had not yet been explored and required defining the best cutoff value for QRS voltage below which any discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) would be regarded as disproportionate and suggestive of AMI. Of note, leads with low‐voltage QRS are a frequent finding in patients with LBBB and AMI, since AMI is associated with lower QRS voltages in patients with LBBB. 8

Figure 1
from a patient without acute myocardial infarction showing isoelectricsegment or minimaldeviation < 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with low‐voltageand the absence of anydeviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) concordant withpolarity.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the electrocardiographic diagnosis of AMI in the presence of LBBB improved by considering the presence of concordant ST depression in any ECG lead and the occurrence of discordant and disproportionate ST deviation in leads with low‐voltage QRS complexes.

Discordantdeviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) is present in leads, and.

We hypothesized that the highest sensitivity would be achieved by an algorithm that took into account all potential aspects of repolarization abnormalities in LBBB, that is, concordant ST elevation, concordant ST depression, and disproportionate discordant ST deviation in leads with a low‐voltage QRS.

The Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa Criteria were applied according to previously published definitions 4, 5 (Table S1).

Clinical Variables

In each patient, we recorded clinical and anthropometric variables, laboratory tests, and electrocardiographic and angiographic data. AMI was diagnosed in the presence of either an acute coronary artery occlusion (grade 0 of the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grading) or an acute coronary lesion with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow ≥ 1 associated with a troponin rise and fall above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Coronary stenosis was considered acute when signs of thrombosis or ulceration were identified by angiography.

The diagnosis of STEMI is based on electrocardiographic criteria that do not apply to patients with LBBB. To test the diagnostic performance of the Modified Sgarbossa rules, Smith and coworkers 5 elaborated a definition of STEMI equivalent based on angiographic findings and the amount of the release of biomarkers of cardiac injury. To get closer to the concept of STEMI equivalent used in the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria, we elaborated a similar definition of STEMI equivalent (see Data S1) and tested the diagnostic performance of the new electrocardiographic criteria by including patients with STEMI equivalent in a separate analysis (see Data S1 and Table S2).

### Validation of the modified sgarbossa criteria for acute coronary occlusion in the setting of left bundle branch block: a retrospective case-control study [^112q8PjH]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The modified Sgarbossa criteria were proposed in a derivation study to be superior to the original criteria for diagnosing acute coronary occlusion (ACO) in left bundle branch block (LBBB). The new rule replaces the third criterion (5 mm of excessively discordant ST elevation [STE]) with a proportion (at least 1 mm STE and STE/S wave ≤ -0.25). We sought to validate the modified criteria.

Methods

This retrospective case-control study was performed by chart review in 2 tertiary care center emergency departments (EDs) and 1 regional referral center. A billing database was used at 1 site to identify all ED patients with LBBB and ischemic symptoms between May 2009 and June 2012. In addition, all 3 sites identified LBBB ACO patients who underwent emergent catheterization. We measured QRS amplitude and J-point deviation in all leads, blinded to outcomes. Acute coronary occlusion was determined by angiographic findings and cardiac biomarker levels, which were collected blinded to electrocardiograms. Diagnostic statistics of each rule were calculated and compared using McNemar's test.

Results

Our consecutive cohort search identified 258 patients: 9 had ACO, and 249 were controls. Among the 3 sites, an additional 36 cases of ACO were identified, for a total of 45 ACO cases and 249 controls. The modified criteria were significantly more sensitive than the original weighted criteria (80% vs 49%, P < .001) and unweighted criteria (80% vs 56%, P < .001). Specificity of the modified criteria was not statistically different from the original weighted criteria (99% vs 100%, P = .5) but was significantly greater than the original unweighted criteria (99% vs 94%, P = .004).

Conclusions

The modified Sgarbossa criteria were superior to the original criteria for identifying ACO in LBBB.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112TJZoB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The BARCELONA algorithm also had good specificity and positive predictive value: only 9% of patients without AMI would have still been transferred for emergent reperfusion by using the new algorithm. This percentage is in agreement with the prevalence of false‐positive activation of the pPCI protocol in the general population, including patients without LBBB. 15 Moreover, the BARCELONA algorithm confirmed a 90% specificity in a large cohort of patients with LBBB without suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Of note, among patients with LBBB and AMI included in the present study, there was a wide range of culprit arteries, including all major coronary branches as well as the left main. Thus, the good performance of the new algorithm could apply to any AMI location. Finally, this new algorithm is simpler as compared with the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria and could be widely applied without determining a relevant delay in diagnosis and reperfusion.

4.2 Terminology and definitions

FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a "snapshot" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR.

The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false‐positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth‐restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false‐negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ± 15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population.

It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process.

4.2.2 Early‐ versus late‐onset FGR

It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early‐onset FGR (< 32 weeks) and late‐onset FGR (≥ 32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management. 16, 17, 18

Early‐onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late‐onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early‐onset FGR with pre‐eclampsia. Therefore, early‐onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early‐onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity. 19

Late‐onset FGR is more common than early‐onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early‐onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre‐eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late‐onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late‐preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late‐onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation ("redistribution" or "brain‐sparing effect"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late‐onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth. 16, 19

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^1112zhKJ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

OMI paradigm shift

"The decision to reject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other".

The study of STEMI anomalies has given rise to the new OMI paradigm (Figure 4). The STEMI and OMI paradigms are now being directly compared with nature and with each other. The OMI timeline summarizes this growing body of literature.

Figure 4
Occlusion MI Paradigm

The OMI paradigm classifies MI by the presence or absence of occlusion in the patient. As with other paradigm shifts, this incorporates the previous paradigm (eg, STEMI(+)OMI) while providing evidence-based advances for STEMI(−)OMI that not only add to ECG interpretation but change the diagnostic focus from ECG to patient. Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 3.

Aslanger published the DIFOCCULT (DIagnostic accuracy oF electrocardiogram for acute coronary OCClUsion resuLTing in myocardial infarction) trial, in which 28% of non-STEMI were reclassified as "OMI" by blinded ECG interpretation alone. These non-STEMI-OMI patients had much larger infarcts and higher 800-day mortality (10.6% vs 4.4%). Similarly, Meyersfound that emergency physicians trained in the OMI paradigm could identify OMI with twice the sensitivity and preserved specificity as STEMI criteria, and significantly earlier.

Citing the work of Meyers, the new American College of Cardiology expert consensus on acute chest pain warns that STEMI criteria "will miss a significant minority of patients with ACO" and that providers need to look for subtle "ECG signs of vessel occlusion" — like hyperacute T waves, subtle STE with reciprocal change, anterior depression from posterior OMI, and Smith-Modified Sgarbossa criteria. This is a crucial acknowledgment of the difference between the limited surrogate marker of STEMI criteria and the underlying pathology of OMI, and promotion of evidence-based ECG advances.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^112iexX8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

STEMI anomalies

"Normal science often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments… The source of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will ultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved into the box the paradigm provides".

Paradigms make normal science possible, but this inevitably leads to the discovery of anomalies that do not fit within the paradigm. When this happens, the normal response is to either reject these anomalies or try to absorb them into the prevailing paradigm. Even before the STEMI paradigm had fully emerged there were 3 early anomalies: anterior STD from posterior OMI, subtle inferior OMI with reciprocal STD in aVL, and Sgarbossa criteria for OMI in the presence of LBBB.

A 1994 report on emergency department diagnosis of STEMI described the challenge of ECG interpretation for borderline STE, and differentiating STEMI from early repolarization, pericarditis, LBBB, and old MI with persisting STE. In other words, by dichotomizing ECGs by presence vs absence of STE, STEMI criteria cannot differentiate between different types of STE, or identify STE secondary to an abnormal QRS with superimposed primary ischemic elevation.

As a result of the vast research catalyzed by the STEMI paradigm, years of angiographic data have demonstrated the chasm between the STEMI/non-STEMI dichotomy and the underlying pathology of OMI (Figure 3).

Figure 3
The STEMI/Non-STEMI False Dichotomy

STEMI criteria are supposed to differentiate patients with ACO from those without. But up to 25% of code STEMI have No ACO: these are appropriately termed false positives, receive a different discharge diagnosis, and are identified as a quality improvement issue. But at least 25% of "Non-STEMI" Have ACO on delayed angiography, with higher mortality. These should be recognized as false negative STEMI and identified as a quality improvement issue, but instead they are still diagnosed as "Non-STEMI". This is what we call the "no false negative paradox": In the STEMI paradigm, there cannot be a false negative diagnosis. ACO = acute coronary occlusion; ECG = electrocardiogram; other abbreviation as in Figure 1.

### Utility of prehospital electrocardiogram interpretation in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction utilizing computer interpretation and transmission for interventional cardiologist consultation [^1153t8HE]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

The following STEMI equivalents were recorded: left bundle branch block (BBB) (new/presumed new or preexisting with Sgarbossa concordance), posterior MI, and left main coronary ischemia. Posterior MI was defined as ST‐segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1−V3 with a prominent R wave or R/S ratio > 1. Left main coronary ischemia was defined as ST‐segment elevation in aVR accompanied by ≥ 1 mm ST‐segment depression in ≥ 6 leads. In addition, the following STEMI mimics were recorded: the early repolarization pattern, pericarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, old MI, Brugada pattern, preexisting left BBB, and paced rhythm. Nondiagnostic ST‐segment elevation was defined as ≥ 0.5 and < 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead. Pathologic Q waves and BBB were defined according to the fourth universal definition MI (4th UDMI) and American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society recommendations, respectively.

To determine the rate of MI, the authors (A. F. and O. G.) adjudicated all cases according to the 4th UDMI after reviewing clinical presentations, PH‐ECGs, coronary angiograms, and troponin T kinetics. Patients were classified as (1) STEMI, (2) non‐STEMI, and (3) no MI. The infarct‐related artery was defined as significant angiographic coronary stenoses (≥ 70%, except for left main coronary artery ≥ 50%) or altered thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade (< 3) in a coronary artery corresponding to the myocardial territory on the index PH‐ECG. In the setting of left BBB, STEMI was adjudicated in patients with cardiac ischemic symptoms and appropriate troponin T kinetics in the presence of Sgarbossa concordance or an infarct‐related artery on coronary angiography.

The fourth‐generation troponin T assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used until June 15, 2011 (99th percentile upper reference limit ≥ 0.01 ng/ml), and the fifth‐generation (high‐sensitivity) troponin T assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used thereafter (99th percentile upper reference limit ≥ 14 ng/L). Peak troponin T levels were divided by the upper reference limits to facilitate comparison between fourth‐ and fifth‐generation assays. First medical contact was defined as time of contact with paramedics, and device time was defined as time of the first device used to achieve reperfusion in the infarct‐related artery.

8.2.2 Gestational age‐related management strategy

The balance between fetal and neonatal risks defines the predominant management strategy at different gestational epochs. Accordingly, the goal of management shifts from gaining fetal viability at 26 weeks to a graded improvement in survival, neonatal morbidity, and neurodevelopment by delaying delivery until 34–36 weeks. The increase in stillbirth rate in undelivered fetuses increasingly favors delivery from 36 weeks onward.

Timing of delivery in FGR has been evaluated in three randomized trials. The growth restriction intervention trial (GRIT) randomized pregnancies that had abnormal fetal biometry and umbilical artery Doppler studies performed as part of clinical management into immediate delivery after completion of a course of steroids versus delivery when the managing physician was no longer comfortable with conservative management. 294, 295 The monitoring protocol and delivery criteria were not specified. The trial demonstrated that, in the absence of specific criteria, either management approach resulted in the same perinatal outcome. Delaying delivery increased the risk of stillbirth, while earlier delivery resulted in a higher degree of prematurity‐related complications that either led to neonatal death or an increased risk of developmental delay.

The disproportionate intrauterine growth intervention trial at term (DIGITAT) randomized SGA fetuses by several biometry criteria, independent of the umbilical artery Doppler pattern, to induction or expectant monitoring between 36 and 41 weeks of gestation. 347 The study demonstrated that, while elective induction did not affect neonatal or obstetric outcomes, deliveries prior to 38 weeks resulted in a higher rate of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.

These trials demonstrate that the relative risk for neonatal complications requires definitive delivery indications until 38 weeks of gestation. After that time, delivery for indication of FGR is likely to prevent stillbirth in ongoing pregnancies. The continuous decrease in neonatal risks requires that delivery indications at early gestational ages occur at a higher threshold for fetal risks than after 30–32 weeks.

### Unraveling the spectrum of left bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction: insights from the assessment of the safety and efficacy of a new thrombolytic (ASSENT 2 and 3) trials [^112uxvkK]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) complicates the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Sgarbossa criteria were developed from GUSTO I to surmount this diagnostic challenge but have not been prospectively validated in a large population with presumed AMI. We evaluated their utility in the diagnosis and risk stratification of AMI patients in ASSENT 2 & 3.

Methods

Baseline electrocardiograms (ECG) of LBBB patients were scored using Sgarbossa's criteria (0–10) by 2 readers blinded to the CK/CK-MB data and clinical outcomes; 267 (1.2%) patients had LBBB on their baseline ECG.

Results

Among 253 LBBB patients with available peak CK/CK-MB data, 158 (62.5%) had peak CK/CK-MB levels > 2x ULN, thereby qualifying for the diagnosis of AMI. A Sgarbossa score of 3 was shown in 48.7% of LBBB patients with elevated CK/CK-MB versus in 12.6% of those without a CK/CK-MB rise (P < .001). Patients with higher Sgarbossa scores, ie, 3, had a higher mortality compared with those with a score < 3, (23.5% vs 7.7% at 30 days P < .001; and 33.7% vs 20.2% at 1 year, P < .001, respectively).

Conclusions

Our findings validate the utility of Sgarbossa criteria for diagnosing AMI in the setting of LBBB. These criteria provide a simple and practical diagnostic approach to risk stratify this diagnostically challenging high-risk group and optimize risk-benefit of acute therapy.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112SfuzZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

ECG Analysis in the Validation Cohort

Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules showed a high specificity (up to 99%) but a limited sensitivity (28%–68%) (Table 3), confirming the results of the derivation cohort.

A max (R|S) voltage value ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) also achieved the highest efficiency (81%) and highest area under the ROC curve (0.77) among the cutoff values tested to define a low‐voltage QRS where disproportionate discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) is suggestive of AMI (Figure 5). Likewise, the validation cohort confirmed that, extending the analysis of concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) to any ECG lead (instead of limiting it to leads V1–V3) resulted in a significant increase of diagnostic sensitivity (from 10% to 40%; P < 0.01).

The BARCELONA algorithm attained a 93% sensitivity, which was significantly higher than that of the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). It also reached the highest negative predictive value (96%) and maintained a 94% specificity, which was not inferior to Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Tables 3 and 7). The global performance of the BARCELONA algorithm was significantly better than previous algorithms: It achieved the highest efficiency (94%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.93), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the ones obtained by the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Figure 6).

Diagnostic Yielding of the ECG in the Entire Cohort of Patients Referred for pPCI

The application of a Sgarbossa score ≥ 3 and the Modified Sgarbossa rules in our entire cohort of 270 patients with LBBB referred for pPCI (101 diagnosed with AMI) would have missed 67 and 36 patients with AMI, respectively. By contrast, the BARCELONA algorithm would have missed only 6 patients.

The influence of coronary reperfusion on the electrocardiographic algorithms could be evaluated in 75 patients with AMI in whom an ECG recorded within the first 48 hours after pPCI was available. After pPCI, the BARCELONA algorithm became negative in 93% of patients with AMI who were positive before reperfusion.

### Smith-modified sgarbossa criteria and paced rhythms: a Case report [^116BoykS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

As the incidence of left bundle branch blocks (LBBBs) and paced-rhythms electrocardiograms (ECGs) increase in the aging global population, the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or STEMI equivalents in patients with these rhythms becomes more imperative. The Sgarbossa and Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria have been documented to enhance the diagnosis of STEMI in the setting of LBBBs. However, there is a growing body of literature that suggests that these criteria can also be applied for the diagnosis of STEMI in patients with paced rhythms.

Case Report

We present the case of an 84-year old man who was on admission for cellulitis when he developed acute respiratory distress. An ECG revealed findings that were consistent with positive Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria, upon which the diagnosis of STEMI was made. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria in paced rhythms is not well documented, if a patient meets these criteria in an appropriate clinical setting, cardiac catheterization laboratory activation by an emergency physician could be appropriate.

### BET 2: diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in the presence of ventricular pacing: can sgarbossa criteria help? [^116zgkNA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The Sgarbossa criteria can be used to identify patients who have acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the presence of left bundle branch block, which obscures the usual changes associated with ST elevation myocardial infarction. Patients with ventricular paced rhythm have ECG changes with similar morphology to left bundle branch block. A short-cut systematic review was carried out to establish whether the Sgarbossa criteria can accurately diagnose AMI in the presence of ventricular paced rhythm. Three studies were directly relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### 'Modified STOPP-START criteria for sri lanka'; translating to a resource limited healthcare setting by Delphi consensus [^111F94vd]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the STOPP/START criteria were modified to overcome common issues encountered when applying the tool in low resource healthcare settings like Sri Lanka. The modified criteria included 105 criteria; 70 STOPP and 35 START criteria, indicating an 8% reduction in criteria compared to the original version. The simplified and more relevant set of criteria is expected to yield a more realistic outcome when assessing for inappropriate medication among older adults in Sri Lanka. It is expected that the modified tool will be used by medical officers or pharmacists to screen out older patients with potentially inappropriate medicines to refer for specialist care. Once validated, we hope to make the Modified STOPP/START criteria for Sri Lanka available online and accessible without a fee for healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka. We also hope to introduce this tool at undergraduate level in a relevant section of the Bachelor of Pharmacy curriculum. The modified tool could also be largely applicable to other countries with similar healthcare systems but should always be validated to the respective country before application in large scale.

### Electrocardiographic criteria for detecting acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block: a meta-analysis [^111mtigj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Numerous investigators have evaluated the ECG algorithm described by Sgarbossa et al to predict acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block and have arrived at divergent conclusions. To clarify the utility of the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these trials.

Methods

A structured search was applied to MEDLINE and Scopus databases, beginning with the year that the algorithm was derived (1996). Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed for method quality, and extracted data (individual study characteristics, screening performance, and interobserver agreement) with a standardized extraction tool. We assessed qualifying studies for heterogeneity and generated summary estimates for the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with fixed-effect models.

Results

We identified 11 studies with 2,100 patients that met criteria for at least 1 component of the analysis. Ten studies with 1,614 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 3. These yielded a summary sensitivity of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 23%), specificity of 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%), a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9 (95% CI 4.5 to 13.8), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.8 (95% CI 0.8 to 0.9). The summary diagnostic odds ratio revealed homogeneity. Seven studies with 1,213 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 2. These yielded sensitivities ranging from 20% to 79% and specificities ranging from 61% to 100%. Positive likelihood ratios ranged from 0.7 to 6.6 and negative likelihood ratios ranged from 0.2 to 1.1. The summary diagnostic odds ratio revealed heterogeneity. Intra- and interobserver agreement was substantial. Sensitivity analysis using the highest-quality studies yielded similar results.

Conclusion

A Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 3, representing greater than or equal to 1 mm of concordant ST elevation or greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression in leads V1 to V3, is useful for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in patients who present with left bundle branch block on ECG. The scoring system demonstrates good to excellent overall interobserver variability. A score of 2, representing 5 mm or more of discordant ST deviation, demonstrated ineffective positive likelihood ratios. A Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of 0 is not useful in excluding acute myocardial infarction.

### Simplifying thrombolysis decisions in patients with left bundle branch block [^111thFC5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To redesign and simplify an existing decision algorithm for the management of patients who present to the emergency department with chest pain and left bundle branch block (LBBB) based on the Sgarbossa criteria. To compare its reliability with the current algorithm.

Methods

A simplified algorithm was created and tested against the existing algorithm. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of patients with LBBB were presented to 10 emergency department doctors with both old and new algorithms a week apart. Six ECGs displayed the relevant criteria for thrombolysis and had proven acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on a gold standard of enzyme measurements. Subjects were asked whether or not they would thrombolyse a patient presenting with the given ECG using each of the algorithms as a guide.

Results

The new algorithm has demonstrated improvements in terms of an increase in appropriate thrombolysis and a reduction in inappropriate thrombolysis. Specificity for AMI rose from 0.85 to 0.99 and sensitivity from 0.38 to 0.6. kappa score showed greater agreement with the gold standard.

Conclusion

Patients with AMI and LBBB have a significantly poorer outcome than those without LBBB. Despite this, thrombolysis is less likely to be given to patients with AMI and LBBB. This study demonstrates that in part this is because of cognitive difficulties using the current algorithm. The proposed proforma addresses these issues and provides a simple tool to aid appropriate treatment in this group of patients.

### Utility of left bundle branch block as a diagnostic criterion for acute myocardial infarction [^1115mhiu]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of new or "presumably new" left bundle branch block (LBBB) as an electrocardiographic criterion equivalent to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in contemporary practice is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that new or presumably new LBBB in symptomatic patients frequently leads to an overdiagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A retrospective analysis of data from consecutive patients in the Mayo Clinic's ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction network from July 2004 to August 2009 was conducted among 892 patients, 36 (4%) of whom had new LBBB. The frequency, clinical characteristics, serum troponin levels, coronary angiographic findings, and outcomes of patients with new LBBB suspected of having AMI were evaluated. Compared with patients without LBBB (n = 856), those with new LBBB were older (64.5 vs 72.9 years, p < 0.001), had higher Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores (22.7 vs 31.0, p < 0.005), were less likely to undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (86% vs 22%, p < 0.001), and had longer door-to-balloon times. Only 14 patients (39%) had final diagnoses of acute coronary syndromes, of which 12 were AMI, while 13 (36%) had cardiac diagnoses other than acute coronary syndrome and 9 (25%) had noncardiac diagnoses. Of the patients with AMI, 5 had occluded culprit arteries, of which 2 involved the left anterior descending coronary artery. A Sgarbossa score ≥ 5 had low sensitivity (14%) but 100% specificity in diagnosing AMI in the presence of new LBBB. In conclusion, new or presumably new LBBB in patients suspected of having AMI identifies a high-risk subgroup, but only a small number have AMI. Two thirds of these patients are discharged from the hospital with alternative diagnoses. The Sgarbossa criteria appear to have limited utility in clinical practice because of their low sensitivity.

### Comparison of the QRS complex, ST-Segment, and T-Wave among patients with left bundle branch block with and without acute myocardial infarction [^111DtG9q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The modified Sgarbossa criteria have been validated as a rule for diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion (ACO) in left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, no analysis has been done on differences in the QRS complex, T-wave, or ST-segment concordance of < 1 mm in the derivation or validation studies. Furthermore, there was no comparison of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but without ACO (i.e., non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [non-STEMI]) to patients with ACO or without AMI (no MI).

Objective

We compare findings involving the QRS amplitude, ST-segment morphology, ST-concordance < 1 mm, and T-waves in patients with LBBB with ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI.

Methods

Retrospectively, emergency department patients were identified with LBBB and ischemic symptoms but no MI, with angiographically proven ACO, and with non-STEMI.

Results

ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI groups consisted of 33, 24, and 105 patients. The sum of the maximum deflection of the QRS amplitude across all leads (ΣQRS) was smaller in patients with ACO than those without ACO (101.5 mm vs. 132.5 mm; p < 0.0001) and a cutoff of ΣQRS < 90 mm was 92% specific. For ACO, non-concave ST-segment morphology was 91% specific, any ST concordance ≥ 1 mm was 95% specific, and any ST concordance ≥ 0.5 mm was 94% sensitive. For non-STEMI, terminal T-wave concordance, analogous to biphasic T-waves, was moderately sensitive at 79%.

Conclusions

We found differences in QRS amplitude, ST-segment morphology, and T-waves between patients with LBBB and ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI. However, none of these criteria outperformed the modified Sgarbossa criteria for diagnosis of ACO in LBBB.

### Development, reporting, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines [^112nrHcU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice parameters have been published with greater frequency by professional societies and groups of experts. These publications run the gamut of practice standards, practice guidelines, consensus statements or practice advisories, position statements, and practice alerts. The definitions of these terms have been clarified in an accompanying article. In this article, we present the criteria for high-quality clinical practice parameters and outline a process for developing them, specifically the Delphi method, which is increasingly being used to build consensus among content experts and stakeholders. Several tools for grading the level of evidence and strength of recommendation are offered and compared. The speciousness of categorizing guidelines as evidence-based or consensus-based will be explained. We examine the recommended checklist for reporting and appraise the tools for evaluating a practice guideline. This article is geared toward developers and reviewers of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements.

### Identifying acute myocardial infarction in ventricular-paced patients: the effectiveness of modified sgarbossa criteria [^114zcKhN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with ventricular pacemakers (VP) is a diagnostic challenge. We report a case where application of the Modified Sgarbossa criteria (mSC) would have immediately identified AMI in a patient with a VP and merited strong advocacy for emergent cardiac catheterization. A 94-year-old male with VP presented to the emergency department (ED) after he had burning sensation in his chest. Initial ECG demonstrated > 5 mm of discordant ST elevation in leads III and aVF which gave him 2 points per original Sgarbossa Criteria (oSC) and not meeting criteria for activation for cardiac catheterization. An ECG at three and a half hours after arrival demonstrated a dynamic change with new V2 concordant depression. At this point, the concordant depression (3 points) and excessive discordance (2 points) gave him a total of 5 points, which then met the oSC for activation of cardiac catheterization (≥ 3 points). Troponin I value (ng/mL) at 0/2/4 h after ED arrival are 0.02, 0.08 and 4.33 respectively. Pain never recurred after single nitroglycerine (NTG) tablet upon arrival. He was urgently taken for catheterization and had acute right coronary artery (RCA) culprit lesion and discharged on hospital day 4. This case report highlighted the benefits of applying mSC to patients with VP, which to authors knowledge remains unvalidated. A significant benefit of mSC is that they are unweighted, thus any positive criteria is suggestive of AMI. While the first EKG yielded an oSC score < 3, applying the unweighted mSC to the EKG revealed ≤ -0.25 ST/S ratio discordant changes in leads III, aVF, I and aVL would have merited strong advocacy for emergent cardiac catherization.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^116Lo8TJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitive and specific criteria for the detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) have eluded electrocardiographers for many years. The article by Di Marco et al in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) 1 suggests that enhanced criteria are a possibility. In 1996, Sgarbossa et al introduced new criteria for the diagnosis of AMI in LBBB purely on the basis of ST changes, with a sensitivity of 36%, a specificity of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 88%. 2 At the time, they represented a new approach, but they were enhanced later by Smith et al, whose modified Sgarbossa criteria 3 had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 90%, although the study group was somewhat small. 3 A follow‐up case‐control study that assessed the same criteria produced results of 80% sensitivity and 99% specificity in 45 patients with an acute coronary occlusion and 249 controls. 4 The modification of Smith et al 3 was to replace one Sgarbossa criterion (STj ≥ 0.5 mV discordant with QRS) with a new criterion, namely |STj/Samp| ≥ 0.25 with STj ≥ 0.1 mV in the same lead.

In the article by Di Marco et al, the sensitivity and specificity in the test group of 107 patients were 93% and 94%, respectively. 1 This compares with 33% and 99% for the original Sgarbossa 2 criteria and 68% and 94% for the modified Sgarbossa criteria, 3, 4 all based on the same test population of patients. Thus, the new approach represents a remarkable improvement in sensitivity, in particular compared with earlier approaches.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112GjydF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The study included 484 patients divided into 3 groups: (1) a derivation cohort formed by 163 patients who were referred for pPCI between October 2009 and December 2014, (2) a validation cohort including 107 patients referred for pPCI from January 2015 until June 2018, and (3) a control group of 214 patients with LBBB and no suspected acute coronary syndrome. The 2 cardiologists who analyzed the ECGs agreed completely on the evaluation of the Sgarbossa criteria. There were 4 cases (1.5%) of disagreement concerning the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria and 2 cases (0.7%) of disagreement with the BARCELONA algorithm, all in patients referred for pPCI. The Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.96 for the Modified Sgarbossa criteria and 0.98 for the BARCELONA algorithm.

Baseline Characteristics of Patients Referred for pPCI

There were no significant differences in terms of cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac history, and in‐hospital death between the derivation and the validation samples (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical Characteristics of the Study Population

AMI was diagnosed in 61 patients (37%) in the derivation cohort and in 40 patients (37%) in the validation sample. As compared with those without a diagnosis of AMI, patients with AMI were more frequently men, had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and prior myocardial infarction, as well as lower left ventricular ejection fraction (Table 1). Clinical and angiographic details of patients with AMI are presented in Table 2. There were no significant differences in AMI characteristics and severity between the derivation and validation cohort (Table 2). Overall, the clinical presentation of the AMI was often severe: 40% of patients were in Killip class III or IV, the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%, and the in‐hospital mortality was 15%.

Baseline Characteristics of Patients With No Suspected AMI

The control group included 23 cases referred for electrophysiological study after syncope, 96 patients referred for pacemaker implantation and 95 patients attended at the emergency department. The complete list of final diagnoses at the emergency department is reported in Table S3. The baseline characteristics of the control group are reported in Table 1. Almost half of patients (46%) had structural heart disease, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 56%.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^1124dam2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

ECG Example

With the above discussion in mind, the reader is encouraged to review again the ECG of Figure 1. Measurements quoted below were derived from automated analysis of the ECG using software from the author's laboratory. 10

The leads of most interest are V2 and V4. The ST amplitude in V2 is 0.542 mV, meeting one of the Sgarbossa criteria, but this does not produce a score sufficient to report AMI. The S‐wave amplitude in V2 is 2.841 mV and so in this lead |STj/Samp| = 0.19 and so the modified Sgarbossa criteria 3 are not met. This criterion was not met in any other lead. The new Barcelona criterion of discordant ST deviation ≥ 0.1 mV is met in V4, where ST amplitude is 0.105 mV and the dominant S wave is 0.482 mV and hence ≤ 0.6 mV. In summary, this ECG should be reported as showing AMI according to the new Barcelona criteria.

In cases of early‐onset FGR the main goal is to prolong pregnancy and maximize fetal maturation by means of expectant management under close monitoring until there is evidence of late Doppler changes in the umbilical artery (AEDV or REDV), ductus venosus alterations, or FHR abnormalities. Therefore, at the point when delivery is indicated in cases of severe early‐onset FGR, the fetus might already be experiencing some degree of hypoxia or acidosis, 291 in which case the likelihood of the fetus tolerating labor is low and the rate of cesarean section has been reported to be greater than 80%. 351 In addition, labor induction in general is less likely to be successful during the preterm period. 352, 353 For these reasons, primary cesarean section is usually the preferred option when delivery is indicated in cases of severe early‐onset FGR. 354

In contrast, late‐onset FGR is usually less severe and fetal hypoxia or acidosis are less likely to be present at the time when delivery is indicated. Indeed, in the DIGITAT trial the rate of vaginal delivery was greater than 80% in pregnancies induced for SGA with normal umbilical artery Doppler after 36 weeks of gestation. 347 This observation suggests that most term SGA fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler can tolerate labor and that the presence of late‐onset FGR in the absence of additional factors does not preclude induction of labor. Several studies have tried to individualize the decision regarding mode of delivery through the development of models for the prediction of urgent cesarean section in women with late‐onset SGA undergoing labor induction. The factors that were most predictive of urgent cesarean section were gestational age, severity of SGA (EFW < 3rd percentile), cerebral Doppler (middle cerebral artery and cerebroplacental ratio), and Bishop score. 355, 356 For example, in a large cohort study of 509 women undergoing labor induction for late‐onset SGA, the predictive model had a positive predictive value of 36% and a negative predictive value of 89% for urgent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal state. 355 Thus, although this information can be helpful for patient counselling regarding mode of delivery and may reassure women with none of these risk factors of the high likelihood of a successful trial of labor (nearly 90%), the positive predictive value of these models (i.e. a risk of cesarean section in the range of 30%–40%) is not high enough to preclude a trial of labor even when these risk factors are present.

### Consensus definition and diagnostic criteria for neonatal encephalopathy-study protocol for a real-time modified Delphi study [^112KuhcX]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The early timepoint required excluded pre-randomization confirmation of other pathologies as a cause of encephalopathies, including genetic and metabolic conditions. None of these trials have reported how many infants had aberrations of growth (head circumference or birthweight for gestational age that departed from the mean by + or − 2 SD or more), were subsequently diagnosed with major malformations or genetic or metabolic disorders that may have contributed to the original presentation. Nor have existing trials reported what percentage of infants had expert examination of the placenta or the results of such examination. Up to 10% had a co-existing sepsis diagnosed which will have contributed to encephalopathic presentation but is not generally considered an exclusion criterion to these treatments. The development of a definition for the umbrella term of NE, which later can be subdivided by aetiology, while maintaining an ability to identify an infant with a presumed or likely hypoxic ischaemic aetiology, will help in the identification of all infants who may benefit from novel treatment strategies, such as those less than 36 weeks gestation, those with a mild encephalopathy, those with higher Apgar scores or less initial acidosis who may still have poor outcomes, those who present later than a 6 h cut-off point, and those with aetiologies such as stroke, genetic or metabolic conditions who, although they may not be the target population for these trial, may be included inadvertently. A broader definition will also aid in the performance of studies in aetiologies that are not purely hypoxic ischaemic in origin.

The use of terminology in this area has been controversial and this has precluded the adoption of previous definitions and diagnostic criteria widely. We believe that part of the reason for this may be because the opinions and lived experience of the wide range of people involved in the care of infants with Neonatal Encephalopathy may not have been incorporated. The involvement of a wide range of experts will aid with implementation and adoption of the final definition. The use of a Delphi consensus process rather than a data-driven process will allow for these opinions to be considered and incorporated.

Clear and internationally consistent definitions and criteria are needed to define NE and its subgroups for the next steps in research on risk factors, natural history, and treatments, and for communication of results. The aim of the DEFINE project, as outlined by the steering group of the project, an international group of experts in NE that includes parent representatives, is the development of an international multidisciplinary consensus definition, using a Delphi consensus approach.

Most current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations as to which type of charts should be used to monitor the growth of twins, 143, 236, 237 while other guidelines specifically recommend the use of singleton‐based charts 238 or twin‐specific charts. 239 As a result, singleton‐based standards are used by default in most centers to assess the growth of twins. However, recent data provide support to the hypothesis that the relative smallness of twins is a benign adaptive mechanism and, therefore, for the use of twin‐specific charts. For example, several studies suggest that the slower growth of twins is the result of differences in programming that is determined as early as the first trimester. 229, 240, 241, 242, 243 In addition, it was found that the use of twin‐specific (versus singleton‐based) charts was associated with a marked decrease in the rate of twins classified as SGA, without affecting the detection rate of stillbirth, suggesting that twin‐specific charts can be used safely. 227, 244, 245 Similar findings were reported in studies that investigated the association between the type of chart used (twin versus singleton charts) and other outcomes such as perinatal complications and long‐term morbidity. 246, 247 Studies that investigated placental pathology findings reported that SGA twins (based on singleton charts) are less likely to have placental histopathological evidence of placental insufficiency when compared with SGA singletons. 248, 249 In another recent study on the association between SGA and pre‐eclampsia, it was found that in contrast to singletons, the diagnosis of SGA in twins based on singleton charts was not associated with a greater risk of pre‐eclampsia, while the association of SGA in twins diagnosed using twin‐specific charts had the same magnitude of association with pre‐eclampsia to that observed between SGA and pre‐eclampsia in singletons. 63 Overall, these findings provide support to the hypothesis that the relative smallness of twins is less likely to be the result of placental insufficiency and, thus, less likely to reflect true growth restriction. Based on that, we believe that it seems reasonable to use twin‐specific charts for the assessment of fetal growth in twin gestations, as this has the potential to avoid overdiagnosis of FGR and the consequences associated with this diagnosis. 246 This approach is supported by the recent guidelines of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG). 239 Of note, the diagnosis of FGR in twin gestations should also take into consideration intertwin size discordance, especially in the case of monochorionic placentation. 250

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^111nX682]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Box 1.
Definitions.

Being born SGA is defined as having a birth weight and/or birth length below −2 SDS for gestational age.
Catch-up growth in height is defined as a growth rate (cm/year) of > 0 SDS, ie, more than the median for chronological age and sex.
Appropriate catch-up growth in height is defined as growing into the normal height range, taking into account the mid-parental height.
Short stature is defined as a height below −2.0 SDS for age and sex.

There was full agreement on these definitions among the taskforce members.

Indications for GH treatment

After GHD, short stature after SGA birth is the second most common indication for GH treatment. Treatment initiation at a young age is one of the most important factors predicting a favorable growth response. Therefore, early identification and referral of children with persistent short stature after SGA birth is very important. In the United States and Latin America, GH treatment can be initiated from an age of 2 years, while children may be treated after the age of 3 years and 4 years in Japan and Europe, respectively. The indication of GH treatment based on height SDS varies between countries with cutoffs between −2.0 and −2.5 SDS, whereas no height SDS criterion is set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States.

Growth velocity < 0 SDS is required by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMA) and Japanese agency (PMDA), but not in the United States and Latin America. EMA requires, in addition, a distance to mid-parental height (MPH) of −1 SDS. Table 4 shows the criteria for GH treatment for short children born SGA in various areas of the world. These are mostly defined as: documented small birth weight and/or birth length (< −2 SDS for gestational age), persistent short stature (< −2.0 SDS), at an age after which catch-up growth is unlikely to occur (3–4 years), growing at an average or subnormal rate for age, provided that other causes for short stature have been ruled out, and that there are no clinical features suggestive of a dysmorphic syndrome (with the exception of SRS). GH treatment is not recommended in several disorders with a high predisposition to develop cancer, such as chromosomal breakage syndromes and DNA repair disorders. Diagnosing these syndromes can be challenging but identifying the genetic etiology before start of GH treatment is important for health prognosis, genetic counseling, and treatment options.

### Validation of the diagnosis and triage algorithm for acute myocardial infarction in the setting of left bundle branch block [^114qmPTN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Detecting acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB) remains a challenge to clinicians. Several diagnostic and triage algorithms have been proposed to accurately identify LBBB patients with an acute culprit vessel. We aimed to validate the algorithm proposed by Cai et al., which uses patients' hemodynamic status and the modified Sgarbossa electrocardiography criteria to guide reperfusion therapy.

Methods

This retrospective study was performed with a chart review in emergency departments (EDs) of 2 medical centers, 2 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital. From January 2010 to December 2014, 2432 consecutive patients were diagnosed as having STEMI in the ED, including 65 patients with LBBB (2.6%).

Results

The patients with LBBB were older and more frequently presented with acute pulmonary edema (58.5% vs 22.1%, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (16.9% vs 6.3% p = 0.006), and VT/VF episodes (7.7% vs 2.2%, p = 0.034) and had a higher 30-day mortality rate (20.0% vs 10.4% p = 0.032) than those without LBBB. We then tested the algorithm proposed by Cai et al. and noted a sensitivity of 93.8% in identifying a culprit lesion.

Conclusions

The inconsistency of the guideline recommendations reflects the uncertainty of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and the pressing need for tools to accurately identify the true acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain and LBBB. The algorithm proposed by Cai et al. had good sensitivity and would allow emergency physicians to implement the timely treatment protocol for this high-risk population.

### International small for gestational age advisory board consensus development conference statement: management of short children born small for gestational age, April 24-October 1, 2001 [^115w9zPf]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide pediatric endocrinologists, general pediatricians, neonatologists, and primary care physicians with recommendations for the management of short children born small for gestational age (SGA).

Methods

A 13-member independent panel of pediatric endocrinologists was convened to discuss relevant issues with respect to definition, diagnosis, and clinical management of short children born SGA. Panel members convened over a series of 3 meetings to thoroughly review, discuss, and come to consensus on the identification and treatment of short children who are born SGA.

Conclusions

SGA is defined as birth weight and/or length at least 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for gestational age (≤ -2 SD). Accurate gestational dating and measurement of birth weight and length are crucial for identifying children who are born SGA. Comprehensive pregnancy, perinatal, and immediate postnatal data may help to confirm the diagnosis. Maternal, placental, and fetal causes of SGA should be sought, although the cause is often not clear. Most children who are SGA experience catch-up growth and achieve a height > 2 SD below the mean; this catch-up process is usually completed by the time they are 2 years of age. A child who is SGA and older than 3 years and has persistent short stature (ie, remaining at least 2 SD below the mean for chronologic age) is not likely to catch up and should be referred to a pediatrician who has expertise in endocrinology. Bone age is not a reliable predictor of height potential in children who are SGA. Nevertheless, a standard evaluation for short stature should be performed. A diagnosis of SGA does not exclude growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and GH assessment should be performed if there is clinical suspicion or biochemical evidence of GH deficiency. At baseline, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid levels as well as blood pressure should be measured, and all aspects of SGA-not just stature-should be addressed with parents. The objectives of GH therapy in short children who are SGA are catch-up growth in early childhood, maintenance of normal growth in childhood, and achievement of normal adult height. GH therapy is effective and safe in short children who are born SGA and should be considered in those older than 2 to 3 years. There is long-term experience of improved growth using a dosage range from 0.24 to 0.48 mg/kg/wk. Higher GH doses (0.48 mg/kg/wk [0.2 IU/kg/d]) are more effective for the short term. Whether the higher GH dose is more efficacious than the lower dose in terms of adult height results is not yet known. Only adult height results of randomized dose-response studies will give a definite answer. Monitoring is necessary to ensure safety of medication. Children should be monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis, lipids, and blood pressure during therapy. The frequency and intensity of monitoring will vary depending on risk factors such as family history, obesity, and puberty.

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^113EZpR6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

4.2.1 Consensus‐based definition of placenta‐related FGR

The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow‐up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus‐based definition for placenta‐mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure. 1 To decrease the likelihood of false‐positive and false‐negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes.

### Standardizing definitions and reporting guidelines for the infertility core outcome set: an international consensus development study [^114rAjpr]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Question

Can consensus definitions for the core outcome set for infertility be identified in order to recommend a standardized approach to reporting?

Summary Answer

Consensus definitions for individual core outcomes, contextual statements, and a standardized reporting table have been developed.

What Is Known Already

Different definitions exist for individual core outcomes for infertility. This variation increases the opportunities for researchers to engage with selective outcome reporting, which undermines secondary research and compromises clinical practice guideline development.

Study Design, Size, Duration

Potential definitions were identified by a systematic review of definition development initiatives and clinical practice guidelines and by reviewing Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. These definitions were discussed in a face-to-face consensus development meeting, which agreed consensus definitions. A standardized approach to reporting was also developed as part of the process.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Healthcare professionals, researchers, and people with fertility problems were brought together in an open and transparent process using formal consensus development methods.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

Forty-four potential definitions were inventoried across four definition development initiatives, including the Harbin Consensus Conference Workshop Group and International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies, 12 clinical practice guidelines, and Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. Twenty-seven participants, from 11 countries, contributed to the consensus development meeting. Consensus definitions were successfully developed for all core outcomes. Specific recommendations were made to improve reporting.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

We used consensus development methods, which have inherent limitations. There was limited representation from low- and middle-income countries.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

A minimum data set should assist researchers in populating protocols, case report forms, and other data collection tools. The generic reporting table should provide clear guidance to researchers and improve the reporting of their results within journal publications and conference presentations. Research funding bodies, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement, and over 80 specialty journals have committed to implementing this core outcome set.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^1179g2eg]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A prospective analysis of STEMI criteria on the initial ECG found they were only 35% sensitive for adjudicated STEMI(including serial ECGs) and 21% for OMI(including non-STEMI with OMI on angiogram) and the recent meta-analysis found a pooled sensitivity of only 43.6% of STEMI criteria for OMI. Large meta-analyses of non-STEMI patients have found that 25% have a totally occluded arteryand 34% have Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 to 1, with nearly double the mortality of non-STEMI without OMI, in spite of younger age and fewer comorbidities.

" Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones".

Emergency physician Dr Stephen Smith led the search for new rules for occlusion, and answered the questions raised by the 1994 report: a formula to differentiate between early repolarization and subtle LAD occlusion, reciprocal STD in aVL to identify subtle inferior OMI and exclude pericarditis, T/QRS ratio to differentiate between old LV aneurysm and anterior STEMI with Q-wave, and the Smith-Modified Sgarbossa criteria to identify OMI in LBBB and paced rhythms.

Throughout the STEMI paradigm, cardiologists and emergency physicians have continued to find patterns of occlusion and reperfusion that do not fit into the STEMI box: Wellens reperfusion T-wave inversion at risk for reocclusion, de Winter T waves indicating LAD occlusion, "South African flag sign" to identify first diagonal occlusion, Aslanger pattern of inferior OMI with concomitant high-grade stenosis, ischemic STD maximum V 1 -V 4 to identify posterior OMI and differentiate it from subendocardial ischemia. These advances reveal the limitations of the STEMI paradigm (Tables 1 and 2).
