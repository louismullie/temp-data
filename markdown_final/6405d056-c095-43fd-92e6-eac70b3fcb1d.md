## Question

What adverse effects are associated with sleep apnea?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects associated with sleep apnea, organized by mechanisms, organ systems, vulnerable populations, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that drives harm. Then, I should categorize outcomes across neurocognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, quality-of-life, perioperative, and mortality domains. Next, I will consider population- and sex-specific vulnerabilities. After that, I will link mechanisms such as intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation to these outcomes. Finally, I will distill clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment, noting areas of uncertainty and the role of precision approaches.

> Let me first confirm the scope and mechanisms. Sleep apnea, encompassing obstructive and central forms, is a multisystem disorder whose adverse consequences are primarily mediated by intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, leading to sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, which collectively affect brain, heart, vessels, and metabolism [^115PbcUM] [^112YwTbU] [^115NCoVy].

> I will now examine neurocognitive and neurobehavioral effects. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a hallmark manifestation that impairs vigilance, work performance, and functional capacity, and is tightly linked to accident risk, with PAP therapy recommended when sleepiness is present in adults with OSA, although I should confirm that symptom relief is the primary evidence-based endpoint here [^113zKF1W] [^notfound]. Beyond sleepiness, there are attentional, memory, and executive deficits and an association with accelerated cognitive decline, with multiple studies suggesting PAP may delay MCI onset or slow progression, although causality warrants cautious interpretation [^113Hxugf] [^116t2o9p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about psychiatric manifestations without checking sources. Mood disturbances, particularly depression, are increased, and OSA-related sleep fragmentation and hypoxia may exacerbate behavioral dysregulation; rare impulse-control phenomena have been described in case reports and resolved with OSA treatment, but I should be careful not to overgeneralize from single cases [^113Hxugf] [^115pWdeB].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and cerebrovascular consequences. OSA contributes to hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and overall cardiovascular morbidity through hypoxemia, sympathetic surges, intrathoracic pressure swings, and endothelial injury, yet large randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events with PAP, highlighting heterogeneity in risk and treatment response [^115NCoVy] [^113Hxugf]. Wait, I see the statement that 70–90% of OSA patients have hypertension; I should double-check because estimates vary by cohort and ascertainment, so I will frame OSA as a strong independent risk factor for incident and resistant hypertension rather than asserting a fixed prevalence across all OSA populations [^116EFF7p] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I cover arrhythmias and stroke linkage precisely. OSA is associated with atrial fibrillation and other brady- and tachyarrhythmias, and the American Heart Association recommends considering sleep apnea evaluation in patients with AF, ventricular tachycardia, sick sinus syndrome, tachycardia–bradycardia syndrome, stroke, survivors of sudden cardiac death, and symptomatic heart failure, underscoring the bidirectional relationship between cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea [^116EFF7p] [^115NCoVy].

> Let me consider heart failure and central sleep apnea explicitly. Central sleep apnea affects roughly one-third to one-half of patients with heart failure and both reflects and worsens HF pathophysiology, while optimizing HF therapy can attenuate CSA; research priorities include defining how evolving HF therapies modify CSA burden and outcomes, which I should note remains an active investigation area [^115Q6Sp2] [^113LPRXW].

> I will now examine metabolic and endocrine effects. OSA is linked to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and worse glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, with a very high prevalence of OSA among patients with diabetes; however, randomized data have not consistently shown HbA1c improvement with PAP, possibly due to insufficient nightly use and inadequate coverage of REM-predominant OSA, so I should emphasize mechanisms and observational associations alongside these trial limitations [^111tQvWX] [^112qaQod].

> Next, I should review respiratory and sleep-related symptomatology. Beyond loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and nocturnal gasping, many patients have atypical or nonclassical symptoms such as morning headaches, nocturia, reflux, chronic cough, dysphagia, and bruxism, which may delay recognition; OSA typically disrupts sleep architecture with arousals, reduced REM sleep, and nonrestorative sleep, further compounding daytime symptoms [^115PbcUM] [^115vobfC].

> Let me think about quality of life and the societal burden. OSA consistently reduces health-related quality of life and imposes substantial economic costs due to healthcare utilization, workplace productivity loss, and accident risk; underdiagnosis remains pervasive, amplifying preventable morbidity and expenditures and reinforcing the value of systematic screening in primary care and high-risk cohorts [^117BoyE5] [^112kpDjZ] [^112qaQod] [^113J6AYw].

> I should confirm perioperative and procedural risks. Patients with known or suspected OSA have higher rates of postoperative respiratory complications and atrial fibrillation, and anesthesia and sleep medicine societies emphasize preoperative screening, communication, and postoperative monitoring, noting numerous sentinel events and persistent gaps in recognition and care pathways that I need to highlight for surgical teams [^111Wk1nh] [^114Kopw1].

> Now, mortality and long-term prognosis. Untreated OSA is independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and longitudinal data suggest natural progression toward more severe disease in some patients, with end-organ injury from hypoxemia and oxidative stress observed; I should also acknowledge that while PAP improves symptoms and quality of life, its effect on hard cardiovascular endpoints has been inconsistent in trials, necessitating targeted risk stratification [^112qaQod] [^113FZTfo] [^114cWKqq].

> I need to check population-specific vulnerabilities. Older adults often present atypically yet suffer significant quality-of-life impairments; adolescents with OSA face meaningful health consequences and severity correlates with obesity and tonsillar hypertrophy; women are historically underdiagnosed and may experience more pronounced cardiovascular sequelae; patients with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, may have compounded cognitive deficits when OSA is undiagnosed, emphasizing the need for vigilant case-finding in these groups [^1162fqEi] [^114s2Sj7] [^112sMCbM] [^1169r3h8].

> Hold on, I should verify the statement about CSA and precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The key point is not that CSA causes precapillary pulmonary hypertension per se, but that patients with pulmonary hypertension warrant screening and that nocturnal oxygenation and periodic breathing can improve with oxygen or acetazolamide in selected contexts; likewise, terminology matters in CSA phenotyping, and "treatment-emergent CSA" should not be misapplied when other comorbid drivers are present [^1157eaEc] [^112bQTYm] [^117MJRAp].

> Let me summarize the mechanistic underpinnings to ensure coherence. Intermittent hypoxia promotes oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation, whereas sleep fragmentation and recurrent arousals drive sympathetic surges and autonomic imbalance with tachycardia–bradycardia responses, collectively explaining downstream neurocognitive impairment, hypertension, arrhythmias, and atherosclerotic progression in vulnerable phenotypes [^115NCoVy] [^114cWKqq] [^116Ktbdo] [^115PbcUM] [^112YwTbU].

> But wait, what if our measurement paradigm is obscuring risk heterogeneity. I should double-check the limitations of the apnea–hypopnea index, which correlates inconsistently with adverse outcomes, whereas physiologic burden metrics such as hypoxic burden and autonomic response markers may better stratify cardiovascular risk and guide individualized therapy, aligning with precision medicine frameworks now proposed for OSA [^117T5FAV] [^113hgErL] [^114cWKqq] [^112gS9Tz].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications. Early recognition and treatment are essential to reduce sleepiness-related accidents, improve quality of life, and potentially mitigate cardiometabolic risks in selected high-burden phenotypes; PAP is recommended for adults with OSA and excessive sleepiness, alternatives such as mandibular advancement devices are reasonable when PAP is not tolerated, and formal polysomnography is preferred in patients with significant comorbidities where home testing may be insufficient [^113zKF1W] [^117B7Ltp] [^111prfud].

> Finally, I need to ensure the take-home is personalized rather than one-size-fits-all. Given heterogeneous mechanisms and outcomes, management should be phenotype- and risk-informed, integrating symptoms, comorbid cardiovascular vulnerability, hypoxic burden, and patient preferences, with shared decision-making and follow-up to optimize adherence and outcomes, while acknowledging that not all patients derive the same cardiovascular benefit from PAP [^112gS9Tz] [^117BoyE5] [^113Hxugf] [^114cWKqq].

Sleep apnea causes **daytime sleepiness** and **cognitive impairment** [^112YwTbU] due to repeated nocturnal hypoxia and arousals [^115PbcUM]. It increases risk of **hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke, and coronary artery disease** [^116EFF7p] through sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction [^115NCoVy]. Metabolic effects include **insulin resistance**, **type 2 diabetes**, and dyslipidemia [^115PbcUM] [^111tQvWX]; mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, and **reduced quality of life** are common [^113Hxugf] [^115PdHb7]. Untreated OSA raises risks of motor vehicle accidents [^113PaXWG] [^115PbcUM], perioperative complications [^111Wk1nh], and early mortality [^113Hxugf] [^115PdHb7]. Treatment with CPAP [^113zKF1W] or oral appliances [^117B7Ltp] improves symptoms and may reduce cardiovascular risk [^111qTu4J].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

Sleep apnea is strongly associated with **cardiovascular complications**, including [^116EFF7p]:

- **Hypertension**: Repeated hypoxia and arousals drive sympathetic activation and endothelial dysfunction, promoting hypertension [^116EFF7p] [^115NCoVy].

- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias from autonomic instability and hypoxemia [^116EFF7p] [^115NCoVy].

- **Heart failure**: Higher risk of incident and worsening heart failure, especially with central sleep apnea [^116EFF7p] [^115Q6Sp2].

- **Coronary artery disease and stroke**: Elevated risk of myocardial infarction and stroke via inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction [^116EFF7p] [^115NCoVy].

---

## Neurological and cognitive side effects

Sleep apnea significantly impacts **neurological and cognitive function** [^112YwTbU]:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Deficits in attention, memory, and executive function from intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation [^112YwTbU] [^115PbcUM].

- **Mood disorders**: Higher rates of depression, anxiety, and irritability due to chronic sleep disruption and hypoxia [^115PbcUM] [^112YwTbU] [^113Hxugf].

- **Daytime sleepiness**: Excessive sleepiness increases accident risk and impairs daily functioning [^115PbcUM] [^115PdHb7] [^113PaXWG].

---

## Metabolic side effects

Sleep apnea is linked to significant **metabolic disturbances**:

- **Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes**: Intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation worsen insulin resistance and diabetes risk [^111tQvWX] [^114cKhNd] [^115PbcUM].

- **Dyslipidemia**: Altered lipid metabolism increases cardiovascular risk [^115NCoVy] [^115PbcUM].

- **Obesity**: Bidirectional relationship with obesity, worsening metabolic syndrome [^113Hxugf] [^115PbcUM].

---

## Respiratory side effects

Sleep apnea impairs **respiratory health**, notably causing **chronic hypoxemia** — recurrent apneas lead to intermittent hypoxemia that contributes to pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain [^115vobfC] — and, in severe cases, progression to **respiratory failure**, including chronic respiratory failure.

---

## Psychological and quality of life impacts

Sleep apnea significantly reduces **quality of life**, with chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances limiting daily activities and social interactions [^113Hxugf] [^115PbcUM], and it confers **increased accident risk**, as daytime sleepiness raises motor vehicle and occupational accident risk [^115PdHb7] [^115PbcUM] [^113PaXWG].

---

## Long-term health consequences

Untreated sleep apnea leads to **severe long-term health consequences**, including **increased mortality**, with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^113Hxugf] [^116EFF7p], and **chronic diseases**, reflecting a greater risk of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory failure.

---

## Treatment and management

Effective management of sleep apnea prioritizes **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** as first-line therapy that improves symptoms and may reduce cardiovascular risk [^113zKF1W] [^111qTu4J]. Oral appliances are alternatives for patients intolerant of CPAP [^117B7Ltp], and lifestyle modifications — such as weight loss, exercise, and alcohol avoidance — improve outcomes [^113PaXWG] [^115PbcUM].

---

Sleep apnea causes **multisystem morbidity** across cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, and respiratory domains, with substantial quality-of-life and mortality impacts; **timely diagnosis and treatment are essential** to reduce these risks [^116EFF7p] [^113Hxugf].

### Impact of sleep apnea on economics [^115PdHb7]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) alters sleep quality and is associated with sleepiness and decreased cognitive functioning. It has, therefore, always been recognized as a major public health issue with potential societal consequences such as accidents, increased morbidity, and cognitive deficits impairing work efficiency. The number of patients diagnosed and treated for OSA has increased drastically in recent years.

In response to this epidemic, health authorities have encouraged studies investigating how patients cope with OSA and its diagnosis, comparing ambulatory to hospital-based polysomnography. Based on epidemiological knowledge, this review aims to carefully describe the possible links between sleep apnea and public health concerns, along with identifying the certainties and missing data concerning the consequences of sleep apnea on accidents, work, economics, and health-related quality of life.

### More than sleepiness: Prevalence and relevance of nonclassical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea [^115PbcUM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder affecting nearly one billion people worldwide, with substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial and societal costs. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep. The two major pathophysiological consequences of OSA are arterial oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation.

The typical OSA syndrome is often represented by an overweight male patient with reported heavy snoring, witnessed apneas, nocturnal gasping, excessive daytime sleepiness, and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. However, there exists a subgroup of individuals who do not report discomfort at night, do not complain about sleepiness, or have unusual symptoms such as bruxism, morning headache, nocturia, acid reflux, chronic cough, and dysphagia, which are not directly linked with the nocturnal breathing problem. Due to these nonspecific symptoms, OSA often remains undiagnosed.

Furthermore, intrinsic sleep disorders can coincide with or may be provoked by OSA, including nightmares, chronic insomnia disorder, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and restless legs syndrome (RLS), among others. When these entities occur together, implications for therapeutic management may arise. This review presents actual data concerning the prevalence of these atypical symptoms and concomitant sleep disorders, as well as their clinical relevance.

### The impact of sleep and hypoxia on the brain: potential mechanisms for the effects of obstructive sleep apnea [^112YwTbU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, highly prevalent, multisystem disease, which is still largely underdiagnosed. Its most prominent risk factors, obesity and older age, are on the rise, and its prevalence is expected to grow further. The last few years have seen an exponential increase in studies to determine the impact of OSA on the central nervous system. OSA-induced brain injury is now a recognized clinical entity, although its possible dual relationship with several other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders is debated. The putative neuromechanisms behind some of the effects of OSA on the central nervous system are discussed in this review, focusing on nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation.

- **Recent findings**: Recent preclinical and clinical findings suggest that neurogenic ischemic preconditioning occurs in some OSA patients, and that it may partly explain variability in clinical findings at the time of writing. However, the distinct parameters of the interplay between ischemic preconditioning, neuroinflammation, sleep fragmentation, and cerebrovascular changes in OSA-induced brain injury are still largely unclear, and more research is required.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis and intervention in patients with OSA is of paramount importance. Future clinical studies should utilize multimodal investigative approaches to enable more reliable referencing for the acuity of the pathological process, as well as its reversibility following treatment.

### Sleep apnea: Types, mechanisms, and clinical cardiovascular consequences [^115NCoVy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease. These disordered breathing events are associated with a profile of perturbations that include intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which are critical mediators of cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Several discoveries in the pathogenesis, along with developments in the treatment of sleep apnea, have accumulated in recent years.

In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of sleep apnea, the evidence that addresses the links between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, and research that has addressed the effect of sleep apnea treatment on cardiovascular disease and clinical endpoints. Finally, we review the recent development in sleep apnea treatment options, with special consideration of treating patients with heart disease. Future directions for selective areas are suggested.

### Adult obstructive sleep apnea: Pathophysiology and diagnosis [^115vobfC]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction that result in arousals and episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturations during sleep. Significant clinical consequences of the disorder cover a wide spectrum, including daytime hypersomnolence, neurocognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, and cor pulmonale. The major risk factors for the disorder include obesity, male gender, and age. Understanding the pathophysiologic basis of the disorder suggests that a balance of anatomically imposed mechanical loads and compensatory neuromuscular responses are important in maintaining upper airway patency during sleep.

OSA develops in the presence of both elevated mechanical loads on the upper airway and defects in compensatory neuromuscular responses. A sleep history and physical examination are important in the identification of patients and appropriate referral for polysomnography. Understanding nuances in the spectrum of presenting complaints and polysomnography correlates are important for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Knowledge of common patterns of OSA may help to identify patients and guide therapy.

### Mechanisms and clinical consequences of untreated central sleep apnea in heart failure [^115Q6Sp2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a highly prevalent, though often unrecognized, comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). Data from HF population studies suggest that it may present in 30% to 50% of HF patients. CSA is recognized as an important contributor to the progression of HF and to HF-related morbidity and mortality. Over the past two decades, an expanding body of research has begun to shed light on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CSA. Armed with this growing knowledge base, the sleep, respiratory, and cardiovascular research communities have been working to identify ways to treat CSA in HF, with the ultimate goal of improving patient quality of life and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we examine the state of knowledge about the mechanisms of CSA in HF and review emerging therapies for this disorder.

### Understanding sleep apnea physiology: A potential path to improving positive airway pressure effectiveness [^112r7QzU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Future work will ultimately need to clarify the impact of trait identification and personalized management on patient-centered outcomes. As we innovate, we must also bear in mind the costs of complexity. The polysomnograms currently necessary for comprehensive trait identification are costly and often inaccessible, particularly for groups with existing barriers to adherence, such as historically disadvantaged populations and those who live in rural areas. Developing automated approaches to measure traits with home testing would be an important step to mitigating this obstacle. Even then, additional unanticipated burdens to the health system from added complexity in decision-making and care pathways are likely. Ultimately, to reduce the burden of untreated OSA, it will be incumbent on us to integrate personalized strategies in a way that promotes equitable access to high-quality OSA care.

### The PAP-RES algorithm: Defining who, why and how to use positive airway pressure therapy for OSA [^112gS9Tz]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Untreated OSA negatively impacts health-related quality of life and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Despite available data suggesting that cardiovascular risk might differ according to clinical phenotypes and comorbidities, approaches to OSA treatment usually take a "one size fits all" strategy. Identification of cardiovascular vulnerability biomarkers and clinical phenotypes associated with response to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy could help to redefine the standard treatment paradigm.

The new PAP-RES (PAP-Responsive) algorithm is based on the identification of OSA phenotypes that are likely to impact therapeutic goals and modalities.

- **Paradigm shift**: The proposed simplified approach defines therapeutic goals based on OSA phenotype, ranging from a predominantly "symptomatic phenotype" (individuals with a high symptom burden that negatively impacts daily life and/or accident risk, or clinically significant insomnia) to a "vulnerable cardiovascular phenotype" (individuals with comorbidities, such as serious cardiovascular or respiratory disease or obesity, that negatively impact cardiovascular prognosis, or a biomarker of hypoxic burden and/or autonomic nervous system dysfunction). Each phenotype requires a different PAP therapy care pathway based on differing health issues and treatment objectives.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^113Ta2sb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of positive airway pressure therapies (PAP), non-PAP therapies, and pharmacological treatment to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical meaningfulness of using various interventions to treat CSA in adults. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

- **Results**: The literature search resulted in 6,701 articles, out of which 103 articles provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and multimorbidity [^112qaQod]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Millions of North Americans are affected by the consequences of sleep disorders. Among these disorders, sleep apnea syndrome has the highest rate of mortality and morbidity. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, 858,900 Canadians reported suffering from sleep apnea, and almost 26% of Canadians are at high risk of developing the condition. This disorder poses a major public health problem due to its prevalence, severity, and socioeconomic burden. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined as the cessation of naso-buccal airflow for more than 10 seconds and is diagnosed based on an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) value greater than five per hour of sleep, usually accompanied by a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation. It is estimated that 80% of obstructive sleep apnea cases remain undiagnosed, making it difficult to identify patients at risk of associated comorbidities. Reuveni et al. suggest that programs be developed to increase the level of suspicion of OSA among primary care providers.

OSA syndrome is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. Fletcher reported that 70% to 90% of patients with OSA have hypertension. Associations between OSA and heart failure, OSA and arrhythmias, OSA and diabetes, OSA and insulin resistance, and OSA and metabolic syndrome have also been reported. Successful treatment of OSA helps to better control many of the associated diseases and chronic conditions. Men, people 40 years old and over, and those with a high body mass index (BMI) or a large neck circumference are at greater risk for OSA.

### Positive airway pressure and cognitive disorders in adults with obstructive sleep apnea: A systematic review of the literature [^116t2o9p]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) and other forms of dementia represent a rising global public health crisis. Because effective treatments to prevent, cure, or slow the progression of dementia are unavailable, identifying treatable risk factors that increase dementia risk, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), could offer promising means to modify dementia occurrence or severity. This study systematically reviewed the impact of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on the incidence of cognitive disorders and cognitive decline among middle-aged and older adults with OSA.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL before May 2021 to identify articles that focused on associations between PAP therapy use and cognitive disorders. We included studies that examined the effects of PAP treatment on (1) the incidence of cognitive disorders among individuals aged 40 and above diagnosed with OSA and (2) the progression of cognitive decline among people with preexisting cognitive disorders and OSA.

- **Results**: We identified 11 studies (3 clinical trials and 8 observational studies). In these studies, 96% of participants had OSA (n = 60,840), and 9% had baseline cognitive impairment, either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (n = 5,826). Of all study participants, 43,970 received PAP therapy, while 16,400 were untreated or in a placebo group. Nine out of 11 studies reported a protective effect of PAP therapy on MCI and AD incidence, including delayed age at MCI onset, reduced MCI or AD incidence, and slower cognitive decline or progression to AD.

### Research priorities for patients with heart failure and central sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113LPRXW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Research priority 7: Determine the impact of established and emerging heart failure therapies on CSA.

Effective heart failure treatment can clearly improve, and even resolve, CSA by reducing chemoreflex sensitivity, improving lung volume, and decreasing circulatory delay. Relatively small-scale (and generally investigator-initiated) studies have shown that medical management, cardiac resynchronization, left ventricular assist devices, and cardiac transplantation improve, but do not always resolve, sleep apnea. Novel therapeutic strategies that may impact CSA should be considered for rigorous investigation:

- **Carotid body denervation**: This has recently gained renewed interest as a potential therapy for heart failure. Disruption of chemoreflex responses may have advantageous effects via decreasing sympathetic tone. However, the importance of carotid bodies in breathing clearly mandates that CSA be considered in this therapeutic approach, both as a potential mediator of any beneficial effects and as a potential adverse consequence. Potential unintended adverse consequences of carotid body denervation may not manifest for many years. Indeed, as weight gain and comorbidities increase with age, so does the presence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing. This may place these individuals at increased risk of respiratory failure during sleep, in which chemical control of breathing dominates.

- **Cardiac rehabilitation**: Another intervention that can have a substantial impact on quality of life in those with heart failure. Physical activity and diet may have an impact on sleep apnea.

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^111Wk1nh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Worldwide, 234 million major surgical procedures are undertaken annually. In view of the increased risk of perioperative complications associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), surgical safety for patients with OSA is a substantial concern globally. As of July 2015, the Joint Commission, Division of Health Care Improvement, had received 61 sentinel perioperative event reports in which a patient was diagnosed with or suspected of having OSA.

- **Concerns cited by the Joint Commission**:
	1. Lack of training for healthcare professionals to screen for and recognize OSA.
	2. Failure to assess patients for OSA.
	3. Lack of guidelines for the care and treatment of individuals at risk for and those diagnosed with OSA.
	4. Failure to implement appropriate monitoring of patients with risk factors associated with OSA.
	5. Lack of communication among healthcare providers regarding patients with OSA or potential risk factors associated with OSA.
	6. Lack of postoperative evaluation and treatment for OSA.

These are all areas waiting for further improvement.

The primary goal of this SASM guideline is to ensure optimal preoperative evaluation of patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to improve patient safety. There is now firm evidence that these patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative evaluation, best done in an anesthesia preoperative clinic, enhances anesthetic management of chronic medical conditions such as OSA through documentation of health status and, where appropriate, adjustment of care plans.

### Definition, discrimination, diagnosis and treatment of central breathing disturbances during sleep [^113rCT9V]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for central sleep apnea, particularly with respect to patients with high altitude-induced CSA, ERS 2017 guidelines recommend considering offering oxygen-enriched air or acetazolamide. This can help reduce high-altitude periodic breathing and improve nocturnal oxygen saturation in healthy lowlanders staying at altitude. Offering combined treatment with acetazolamide and automatic positive airway pressure is suggested to prevent central apneas and improve nocturnal oxygen saturation.

### Continuous positive airway pressure treatment of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea reduces cardiovascular risk [^111qTu4J]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk, but the impact of mild forms of OSA and their treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes in treated versus untreated patients with OSA.

- **Methods**: Consecutive sleep laboratory patients with all degrees of OSA were included. Endpoints were nonfatal (myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome requiring revascularization procedures) and fatal (death from myocardial infarction or stroke) cardiovascular events.

- **Measurements and main results**: Comparison of event-free survival rates in treated versus untreated patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank test) was conducted. Of 449 patients enrolled (age, 56.0 ± 10.5 years; body mass index, 30.8 ± 5.4 kg/m²), 364 patients received OSA treatment, and 85 patients remained untreated. The median follow-up was 72.0 months (range, 1–156). The mean apnea-hypopnea index before treatment was 30.9 ± 21.8/hour in treated and 15.3 ± 13.0/hour in untreated patients, but there were no differences in cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors. In patients with mild to moderate OSA (n = 288), events were more frequent in untreated patients (estimated event-free survival at 10 years, 51.8% vs. 80.3% [P < 0.001]; absolute risk reduction, 28.5%; number needed to treat to prevent one event over 10 years, 3.5). After adjustment for age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, and comorbidities at baseline, OSA treatment was an independent predictor for events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval).

### Patient-centered care in obstructive sleep apnea: A vision for the future [^117BoyE5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition with multiple potential neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic consequences. Efficacious treatment is available; however, patient engagement is typically required for effective results. Patients with sleep apnea are phenotypically diverse and have individual needs, preferences, and values affecting treatment decisions. There has been a shift in obstructive sleep apnea management from diagnosis to chronic care management.

Making treatment decisions that incorporate an individual patient's values and preferences, and are personalized for that patient's biology, has the potential to improve patient outcomes. A patient-centered care approach in obstructive sleep apnea includes the following:

- **Determining patient-specific needs**: Guide treatment decisions.
- **Understanding patient values, preferences, and other impacting factors**: Use shared decision-making.
- **Enhancing patient education and support**: Improve treatment adherence.
- **Promoting patient engagement**: Encourage active participation in care.
- **Optimizing care coordination, continuity, and access**: Ensure seamless and accessible care.
- **Determining and assessing patient-centered outcomes**: Focus on outcomes that matter to patients.

### Insights, recommendations, and research priorities for central sleep apnea: Report from an expert panel [^115TjBBe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is commonly encountered among patients with sleep-disordered breathing; however, its clinical consequences are less well-characterized. The senior author (A.M.) convened an expert panel to discuss the common presentations of CSA, as well as challenges and knowledge gaps in its diagnosis and management. The panel identified several key research priorities essential for advancing our understanding of the disorder.

- **Diagnostic realm**: Panel members discussed the utility of multinight assessments and the importance of developing and validating novel metrics and automated assessments for differentiating central vs. obstructive hypopneas, so their impact on clinical outcomes and management may be better evaluated.
- **Therapeutic landscape for CSA management**: Therapies should primarily aim to alleviate sleep-related symptoms, after optimizing treatment to address the underlying cause. Most importantly, the panel concluded there is a need to further investigate the clinical consequences of CSA, as well as the implications of therapy on clinical outcomes, particularly among those who are asymptomatic.

Future research should focus on endo-phenotyping central events for a better mechanistic understanding of the disease, validating novel diagnostic methods for implementation in routine clinical practice, as well as the use of combination therapy and comparative effectiveness trials in elucidating the most efficacious interventions for managing CSA.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116ezaSE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statements**: The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure:
	1. Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing.
	2. Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during treatment.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^114cWKqq]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a substantial clinical and public health problem because it contributes to harmful effects on quality of life, daytime symptoms, road traffic incidents, and cardiometabolic disease. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnoea is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with patients exhibiting varied susceptibility to long-term complications and different responses to treatment. This narrative review summarizes the knowledge of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea, particularly the role of symptom clusters, polysomnogram phenotypes, physiological endotypes, and circulating biomarkers in defining subtypes. In the near future, the prognostic accuracy of these measures in predicting long-term complications in obstructive sleep apnoea will likely be improved, together with better matching of treatments to disease subtypes.

### Should all sleep apnoea patients be treated [^115twADy]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Sleep apnoea is a condition in which people stop breathing during sleep. A number of studies in general and worker populations have shown that the prevalence of an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) > 10 is in the range of 20%. Subjects with an AHI > 10 who complain of excessive daytime somnolence, tiredness, asphyxic episodes during the night, or non-refreshing sleep, among other symptoms, suffer from sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS). The prevalence of SAHS is around 4%. Owing to its high prevalence, clinical symptoms, probable secondary cardiovascular consequences, and associated social problems, SAHS has a considerable impact on health, management of which is worth considering.

Despite the fact that SAHS treatment has been challenged, recent studies conclude that nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is undoubtedly effective in clearly symptomatic patients. Its use in clinical practice is adequately supported in the treatment of moderate to severe SAHS. Further studies are needed to define the lower range of symptoms to be treated. One of the most important problems encountered in this area results from the combination of two situations. On the one hand, different epidemiological studies have demonstrated that an AHI > 10 without symptoms is present in around 15% of the general population. On the other hand, several studies suggest that having a high AHI, even without secondary symptoms, gives rise to some undesirable effects such as traffic accidents and cardiovascular consequences. In this context, comprehensive epidemiological studies are therefore needed.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^1138Ekyn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

An obstructive sleep-disordered breathing future perspective is needed. It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which, according to official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is "neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity".

An important publication by Solano‐Pérez E. et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypopneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypopneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long-term consequences of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences.

### Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea overlap: What has the evidence taught us [^113n929N]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma are highly prevalent chronic respiratory disorders. Beyond their frequent coexistence arising from high prevalence and shared risk factors, these disorders feature a reciprocal interaction whereby each disease impacts the severity of the other. Emerging evidence implicates airway and systemic inflammation, neuroimmune interactions, and effects of asthma-controlling medications, such as corticosteroids, as factors that predispose patients with asthma to OSA. Conversely, undiagnosed or inadequately treated OSA adversely affects asthma control, partly through the effects of intermittent hypoxia on airway inflammation and tissue remodeling.

In this article, we review multiple lines of recently published evidence supporting this interaction. We provide a set of recommendations for clinicians involved in the care of adults with asthma and identify critical gaps in our knowledge about this overlap.

### Predictors of obstructive sleep apnea severity in adolescents [^114s2Sj7]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea has severe health consequences, yet little is known about predictors of sleep apnea severity in the adolescent population. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical and demographic factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity in adolescents.

Design, setting, and participants: A retrospective case series of 224 children (53% male), ages 12 to 17 years who underwent polysomnography from January 1, 2013, to June 4, 2015, was carried out in a large tertiary referral children's hospital associated with an academic medical center in Dallas, Texas. Children were excluded if they were missing clinical data (e.g. tonsil size), had major comorbidities (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities), or had previously undergone tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The mean (SD) age was 14.6 (1.7) years (range, 12.0–17.9 years), and the patients were 55% Hispanic, 30% African American, 13% White, and 2% other.

- **Exposures**: Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and polysomnographic parameters.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Correlation between demographic and clinical characteristics and the apnea hypopnea index.

Results: In 224 adolescents (53% male) aged 12 to 17 years, the mean (SD) apnea hypopnea index was 14.9 (28.7) (range, 0.0–187.7) and was positively correlated with CDC-defined weight categories (P = 0.04) and tonsillar hypertrophy (P10) was more common in males (OR, 1.8; 95% CI.

### Associations between the use of common medications and sleep architecture in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea [^114nsxSV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often associated with other disorders, which are usually treated with medications. Little is known about the extent to which medications are used in the OSA population or the effects of common prescription medications on the sleep architecture of patients with OSA. This study aimed to describe the frequency of medication use by patients with untreated OSA and to examine the potential associations between specific, frequently used medication types and indexes of sleep architecture assessed through laboratory-based polysomnography.

This study utilized a retrospective design with analyses of archival clinical data and took place in a tertiary public sleep disorders center in Brisbane, Australia. Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of OSA (N = 1779) participated. No interventions were implemented.

Of the patients with OSA, 77.1% were taking at least one medication; 12.4% were taking beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and 20.8% were taking antidepressant or anxiolytic medications. Analyses of covariance demonstrated reliable effects of medication use on sleep architecture, after accounting for age, sex, and body mass index. Both tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant or anxiolytic medications were associated with a lower percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and lower sleep-efficiency values in patients with OSA, compared with those not taking any medications. The use of beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents and aspirin had no consistent effects.

### Cancer risk associated with continuous positive airway pressure: A national study [^1168iKY8]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects a large proportion of the general population, with an approximate prevalence of 15%–30%. A consequence of untreated sleep apnea is excessive fatigue during the day, which is known to negatively impact daily function, including decreasing workplace productivity and increasing the risk of motor vehicle accidents. Long-term consequences of sleep apnea include resistant hypertension, increased stroke risk, and major morbidity, which have been shown to contribute to early mortality. Studies have consistently described the adverse effects and decreased quality of life associated with untreated OSA. Guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the gold standard for OSA management. Given the poor outcomes associated with untreated OSA, understanding factors that affect compliance with CPAP is an important clinical question that has health implications for a large number of patients.

The U.S. FDA issued a Class 1 safety recall notice in July of 2021 for CPAP devices due to the risk of carcinogen exposure from degradation of the polyurethane sound abatement foam. Class 1 safety recall notices are the most serious type of recall, only used in cases of severe injury or death. CPAP devices function by producing airflow through a well-fitted mask that creates enough pressure to force the upper airway open, thereby reducing hypoxemic events associated with respiration during sleep. The efficacy of CPAP machines is well established in the literature, with numerous studies demonstrating their effectiveness.

### Sleep apnea in schizophrenia: Estimating prevalence and impact on cognition [^1169r3h8]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Untreated medical illnesses can compound the disabling cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) not only impairs cognitive domains also affected by schizophrenia, but it is also common and treatable. The effects of sleep apnea on cognition in schizophrenia are not well understood.

We estimated the prevalence of OSA in a previously characterized sample of 3,942 Veterans with schizophrenia by self-report and with a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk for OSA. We then compared neuropsychological and functional capacity assessment results between those who reported OSA versus those who did not, and between those predicted to have OSA versus predicted to not have OSA. We expected that many Veterans not reporting sleep apnea would be predicted to have it, and that both reported and predicted sleep apnea would be associated with lower cognitive and functional performance.

The reported prevalence of OSA in the sample was 14%, whereas 72% were predicted to be at high risk of OSA. Interestingly, participants who reported having OSA had better cognitive and functional capacity performance (p's < 0.001) compared to those who did not report OSA, particularly on speed of processing assessments (p < 0.001). Predicted OSA, by contrast, was associated with lower speed of processing, verbal learning, and working memory test scores (p's < 0.001). One possible interpretation of these results is that people with higher cognitive capacity may be more likely to seek medical care, while those with cognitive impairments are at greater risk for having untreated conditions.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^113DLPrN]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for obstructive sleep apnea, specifically concerning therapies with no evidence for benefit, the DoD/VA 2025 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of the following interventions for OSA:

- **EPAP**: Expiratory positive airway pressure.
- **Inspiratory muscle therapy**: Exercises aimed at strengthening the muscles involved in breathing.
- **Intra-oral negative airway pressure**: Devices creating suction in the oral cavity to improve airway patency.
- **Myofunctional exercise**: Exercises targeting the muscles of the mouth and throat.
- **Neuromuscular electrical stimulation**: The use of electrical impulses to stimulate muscle contractions.
- **Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation**: The application of electrical currents through the skin for therapeutic purposes.

### Hypoxic burden - definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^117T5FAV]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder affecting over a billion people worldwide. When left untreated, OSA is associated with adverse consequences such as daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and neurocognitive impairment. OSA is characterized by repetitive events of either complete (apneas) or partial upper airway collapse (hypopneas). Immediate consequences of these repetitive events include oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, whether anatomic or nonanatomic, the immediate consequences of oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep are commonly observed in almost all OSA patients.

The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which considers the frequency of respiratory events associated with either oxygen desaturation or arousals from sleep, has become the prevailing measure of both the presence and severity of OSA as a disease. However, AHI is inconsistently related to the adverse consequences of OSA. While epidemiological studies suggest that OSA, determined by AHI, is associated with CVD mortality and morbidity, baseline AHI or changes in AHI with treatment of OSA fail to predict adverse outcomes. Furthermore, pretreatment AHI poorly predicts the degree of clinical improvement achieved with OSA treatment. Consequently, randomized controlled trials hypothesizing that treatment of OSA would lead to a lower incidence of CVD have not yet been successful.

### Sleep disordered breathing in the elderly [^1162fqEi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is highly prevalent among the elderly, where it may present with atypical symptoms. Untreated OSA can reduce quality of life and lead to adverse health consequences. Effective treatment options are available, so it is imperative that all physicians treating the elderly are aware of the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and treatment options for OSA.

### Split-night polysomnography [^114jYQzW]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder associated with serious health consequences, increased health care utilization, and an economic burden. With greater public and medical attention to sleep disorders, the volume of referrals for sleep studies over the last decade has increased approximately twelvefold. Despite the steep growth in infrastructure to diagnose and treat OSA, access to such services remains a significant problem, and demand overwhelms capacity. To expedite the diagnosis of sleep apnea and the prescription of treatment, one strategy adopted by sleep specialists is to employ split-night polysomnography. This approach encompasses both the diagnosis of OSA and the initiation of positive pressure therapy in a single night. This article reviews the literature examining this combined diagnostic and therapeutic strategy and discusses the applicable third-party issues of procedural coding and reimbursement.

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^114Kopw1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine guidelines were developed to address deficiencies in previously published practice guidelines and related reviews. These past contributions often failed to sufficiently examine and objectively establish obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a perioperative risk factor. Moreover, few focused on objective assessments of how to identify patients with OSA.

An example of this is the ASA Practice Guideline for the Perioperative Management of Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, published in 2014 to update the 2006 guideline. It recommends preoperative screening to identify undiagnosed OSA, preoperative initiation of CPAP therapy for OSA where possible, and postoperative monitoring of OSA patients. However, despite best intentions, a significant dilemma arises because these broadly based recommendations depend on limited evidence, and the cost of implementation is high. Given this problem, a more focused and practical approach is needed to balance the desire to reduce postoperative adverse events and improve long-term health benefits with appropriate allocation of health care resources.

### Opportunities for cardiovascular benefits in treating obstructive sleep apnea in the secondary prevention scenario [^113Q8vZJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Understanding the cardiovascular (CV) impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is now a mature research field. After more than four decades of experimental, translational, and clinical studies (most of them observational or small randomized trials) showing a myriad of OSA consequences such as hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and coronary artery disease (CAD), we were recently challenged to reach the top of the scientific evidence. Like in any other field, randomization reduces bias and provides a rigorous tool to examine cause–effect relationships between an intervention and outcome.

The obvious initial strategy is to select patients with a high-CV-risk profile to increase the chance of detecting differences during a relatively short period of time and aiming for feasibility; events in the primary prevention scenario usually have lower incidence, requiring more than double the number of patients and follow-up time than secondary prevention studies. However, expectations based on promising previous observational studies in primary prevention did not come true for secondary prevention. Recent randomized trials comprising patients with OSA with previous CAD or cerebrovascular disease (SAVE [Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints]), CAD only (RICCADSA [Randomized Intervention with CPAP in Coronary Artery Disease and Sleep Apnea]), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (ISAACC [Impact of Sleep Apnea Syndrome in the Evolution of Acute Coronary Syndrome]) showed neutral results in their primary outcomes, although subanalysis suggested significant effects in patients.

### Central sleep apnea: Pathophysiology and treatment [^113C8dyg]. Chest (2007). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on central sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: CSA is a sleep disorder characterized by intermittent cessation or reduction of respiratory effort during sleep due to a lack of respiratory drive from the brain.

- **Pathophysiology**: CSA can be idiopathic or associated with underlying disorders such as heart failure (HF), stroke, opioid use, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and high-altitude exposure. The pathophysiology of CSA involves unstable ventilatory control during sleep, leading to periods of insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of CSA is estimated at 7.8% in males and 0.3% in females in the general population, and up to 25–40% in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CSA include male sex, older age, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, and opioid use.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, CSA presents with symptoms such as frequent awakenings, non-refreshing sleep, nocturnal dyspnea, snoring, difficulty staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. It can present with or without Cheyne-Stokes breathing.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of CSA can vary based on the underlying causes and associated comorbidities. However, with timely diagnosis and appropriate management, the quality of life (QoL) and clinical outcomes can be significantly improved.

### Physiology may be the key: Cardiovascular risk stratification in obstructive sleep apnea [^116Ktbdo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A potential explanation for the ineffectiveness of CPAP therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is that the effect of OSA on CVD could vary between individuals. Although OSA severity is generally quantified using frequency-oriented metrics, such as the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index, these metrics may not adequately quantify the magnitude of OSA-related physiologic insults that are experienced by an individual with OSA and could contribute to CVD events. This has led to efforts to identify OSA subgroups that appear to be most vulnerable to CVD events and efforts to stratify patients with OSA according to measurable physiologic insults. To this end, several studies have highlighted an association between the severity of OSA-related hypoxemic burden and CVD events.

In this issue of the journal, Azarbarzin and colleagues report on associations between the pulse rate response to an apnea or hypopnea (ΔHR) and CVD outcomes. The ΔHR, measured by pulse oximetry, is considered a biomarker of the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) response to a respiratory event and is a novel method for attempting to quantify another potentially important OSA-related physiologic insult. The authors examined the association between ΔHR and CVD in two community-based cohorts.

In a preliminary analysis of 1,395 middle-aged and older adults without overt CVD from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort, the cross-sectional association between ΔHR and subclinical CVD biomarkers, such as coronary calcium, NT-proBNP, and Framingham risk, was explored.

### Quality measure for screening for adult obstructive sleep apnea by primary care physicians [^113J6AYw]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition that remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Untreated OSA is associated with several chronic medical conditions, a reduction in quality of life, and increases in health care costs. Therefore, early identification of undiagnosed cases is important. Implementation of a screening measure in a primary care environment for populations at high risk for OSA could improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care burden of untreated OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^11687iiU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Evaluation and diagnosis**: The evaluation for sleep apnea begins with a comprehensive sleep assessment, which includes a thorough clinical history documenting signs or symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, snoring, witnessed apnea, or difficulty concentrating. It also involves a physical examination and a review of the medical history for relevant comorbidities and other risk factors. Patients with suspected sleep apnea following this assessment should undergo diagnostic testing, the criterion standard of which is polysomnography.

Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is generally reserved for individuals with an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apneas and hypopneas observed per hour) ≥ 5, measured during a sleep study in patients with either signs or symptoms of sleep apnea or associated medical conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, significant arrhythmias, and other forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Alternatively, an AHI ≥ 15 is often treated as OSA even in the absence of signs, symptoms, or associated medical conditions. Severity is also determined using the AHI, with 5 to 14 considered mild, 15 to 30 moderate, and > 30 severe disease.

Significant night‐to‐night variability of AHI has been observed in studies of consecutive night polysomnography, with 7% to 25% of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for moderate‐to‐severe OSA on the second night despite a negative result the previous evening. Guidelines therefore recommend repeating polysomnography in patients with a negative initial study when clinical suspicion of OSA remains high.

### Severe onychophagia and finger mutilation associated with obstructive sleep apnea [^115pWdeB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to significant neurobehavioral consequences, including cognitive deficits, hyperactivity/inattention, daytime sleepiness, and mood disturbances. Interestingly, the potential role of OSA in the pathogenesis of impulse-control disorders, such as nail biting (onychophagia), is currently unknown.

We present a case of a man with severe onychophagia and biting-induced finger mutilation that was completely resolved after diagnosis and treatment of severe OSA. Accordingly, this report represents an important clinical observation that suggests a connection between sleep physiology and the neurobiological circuits implicated in the regulation of impulse-control behaviors. Further research in this area may improve our understanding of the neurobehavioral consequences of untreated OSA.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111prfud]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, specifically concerning the initial sleep study, AASM 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, as a first-line test for OSA in patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Significant cardiorespiratory disease**: It is critical to use polysomnography to ensure accurate diagnosis.

- **Potential respiratory muscle weakness due to a neuromuscular condition**: Polysomnography provides comprehensive data in such complex cases.

- **Awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep-related hypoventilation**: In these scenarios, detailed monitoring is required.

- **Chronic opioid medication use**: These patients often have specific monitoring needs.

- **History of stroke**: Comprehensive assessment via polysomnography is necessary.

- **Severe insomnia**: This condition necessitates detailed sleep pattern analysis.

These guidelines highlight the importance of selecting appropriate diagnostic tests for patients exhibiting specific health conditions.

### Cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea in different study models and novel perspectives [^114r5PUx]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is heterogeneous in terms of contributing pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, and consequences. Different study models, from animal models of intermittent hypoxia to case-control, cohort, and population-based observational studies, as well as uncontrolled interventional and randomized controlled interventional trials, have contributed to the knowledge base. Controversial findings on underlying mechanisms and consequences of untreated OSA have challenged the field and resulted in uncertainty in treatment recommendations.

The heterogeneity of OSA in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes, along with the strengths and limitations of different study models and designs used for studying OSA pathophysiology and cardiovascular consequences, are discussed in the context of controversial findings on cardiovascular outcomes in OSA. In addition, recent findings from randomized controlled continuous positive airway pressure therapy withdrawal trials, an efficient and controlled study model, are highlighted.

Novel designs for clinical trials on long-term outcomes in the highly prevalent patient group with OSA, addressing the heterogeneity in underlying mechanisms, different phenotypes in terms of cardiovascular risk, and new treatment concepts, are needed to improve clinical practice standards.

### Should all sleep apnoea patients be treated? Yes [^113FZTfo]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition. Whether an apnoeic patient should be considered for treatment depends on the definition of the syndrome, the rating of its severity, and the potential morbidity associated with this condition. We have reviewed several types of evidence that early treatments of OSA are warranted. There is a natural progression of OSA leading to spontaneous aggravation and increased cardiovascular morbidity in untreated patients within clinical populations. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a key symptom of the disease, can occur with very low apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and can be eliminated by adequate treatment. Cardiovascular risks exist even with very low AHI, and there is a high relative risk of developing hypertension in the future when patients present with mild OSA at baseline.

The effect of treatment is significant when compared with placebo in the mildest forms of the disease. Clinically, the main benefit is expected in terms of reducing behavioural morbidity (i.e. reversibility of EDS and its related consequences) since the impact on cardiovascular morbidity is more questionable and may not be observed in a short-term follow-up. Overall, any OSA syndrome that is clearly responsible for EDS should be considered for treatment. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that cardiovascular risk needs to be taken into account when deciding on treatment, even in asymptomatic patients. All this evidence suggests early treatment in OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^116bZE7z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although these limitations may serve as topics of interest for future investigations, the best available evidence does not support the use of PAP therapy specifically for the purpose of reducing the risk of future adverse events at this time. Therefore, we suggest diagnostic testing for patients with established CAD, cerebrovascular disease, or elevated cardiovascular risk in whom sleep apnea is clinically suspected because of signs or symptoms uncovered during clinical sleep assessment.

- **Perioperative risk**: Comorbid OSA is relevant to the perioperative management of patients with CVD planning to undergo surgery. OSA not only increases the risk of respiratory complications, but some studies have reported an increased risk of postoperative AF and other cardiac complications. The high prevalence of undiagnosed OSA, combined with the observation that perioperative complications are more common in patients with undiagnosed OSA, has prompted many centers to incorporate screening for OSA as a routine component of preoperative assessment. Various sleep questionnaires have been utilized in this role, with STOP-BANG being the most validated in the surgical patient population. A STOP-BANG score ≥ 3 identifies patients at risk of OSA and has been independently associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. In patients with previously diagnosed OSA, preoperative evaluation should include a review of prior sleep study results to confirm the type and severity of sleep apnea as well as an assessment of their compliance with PAP and/or other therapies.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and severe mental illness: Evolution and consequences [^114pq4Bk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep complaints are commonly encountered in psychiatric clinics. Underlying medical or sleep disorders need to be identified and treated to optimize the treatment of mental illness. Excessive daytime sleepiness, the main symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), overlaps with symptoms of many severe mental illnesses. Medication side effects or the disorder itself may account for daytime sleepiness; however, comorbid OSA is a possibility that should not be overlooked. The diagnosis of OSA is straightforward, but treatment compliance is problematic in psychiatric patients. This article summarizes studies concerning comorbid OSA in patients with severe mental illness and includes suggestions for future investigations.

### Association of obstructive sleep apnea in rapid eye movement sleep with reduced glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^111tQvWX]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is both a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and a frequent comorbidity with an adverse impact on glycemic control. Five independent studies, totaling nearly 1,400 patients with type 2 diabetes, have shown that the prevalence of OSA (assessed by polysomnography [PSG]) ranges between 58% and 86%. Several studies have established a robust association — independent of adiposity and other known confounders — between the presence and severity of OSA and insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in nondiabetic adults. Two studies using the gold standard of in-laboratory PSG to accurately quantify OSA severity reported a robust association between increasing OSA severity and increasing levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes, after controlling for multiple potential confounders.

While these findings suggested that the effective treatment of OSA might be a nonpharmacologic strategy to improve glucose control, the results of the only randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes were surprisingly disappointing.

One potential reason for the failure of OSA treatment to improve chronic glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is insufficient CPAP use. Notably, the mean nightly CPAP use in this clinical trial was 3.6 hours. As most of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs in the early morning hours before habitual awakening, one possible explanation is minimized CPAP effectiveness due to short usage durations.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnea [^114cKhNd]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by the collapse of the upper airway during sleep and is the most common respiratory disorder related to sleep. It is a major global health problem with substantial economic and social burdens because untreated obstructive sleep apnea is associated with daytime sleepiness, poor sleep quality, reduced work productivity, and increased rates of road traffic incidents and occupational injuries. Obstructive sleep apnea also causes multiple adverse physiological and biochemical effects, including hypoxemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, sympathetic activation, cortical arousal, tachycardia, and vasoconstriction. In some patients, these adverse effects cause end organ damage and long-term complications, including premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, chronic kidney disease, and neurodegeneration.

Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, is an approach tailored to the prevention and treatment of the disease that takes into account variability in genes, the environment, and lifestyle for each person. Precision medicine targets treatments to patients who are most likely to benefit from them, in contrast with the traditional one-size-fits-all approach for prevention and care. The goal of precision medicine is to target the right treatments to the right patients at the right time.

Obstructive sleep apnea is being increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease, and emerging evidence suggests the potential of using precision medicine approaches.

### Circulating biomarkers to identify cardiometabolic complications in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: A systematic review [^11316hJ9]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and myocardial infarction. However, it is difficult to predict which patients are at particularly high risk. This systematic review aimed to identify potentially useful circulating biomarkers that could predict cardiometabolic complications in OSA. We searched Cochrane (EBM), EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Search concepts included: "Obstructive Sleep Apnea", "Biomarkers", and "Risk-Stratification". Manuscripts were included if they studied adults with OSA, circulating (blood) markers, and relationships with clinical outcomes. After screening, 10 were included. Studies addressed cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and metabolic syndrome. In general, levels of inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules, and vascular proteins were associated with the presence of cardiometabolic disease in OSA patients.

Although studies regarding prognostic circulating biomarkers in OSA are limited, a number of potentially promising biomarkers were identified in our review. However, more research is needed using prospective cohorts to determine which biomarkers are most robustly associated with and useful in predicting future cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae in OSA patients. Identification of such biomarkers could guide more selective and targeted therapy for OSA in an emerging era of precision-based medicine.

### More than the sum of the respiratory events: Personalized medicine approaches for obstructive sleep apnea [^113hgErL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Continuous positive airway pressure is generally first-line therapy despite low adherence because it reliably reduces the AHI when used, and the response to other therapies is variable. However, there is growing appreciation that the underlying etiology (i.e. endotype) and clinical manifestation (i.e. phenotype) of OSA in an individual are not well described by the AHI.

We define and review the important progress made in understanding and measuring physiological mechanisms (or endotypes) that help define subtypes of OSA and identify the potential use of genetics to further refine disease classification. This more detailed understanding of OSA pathogenesis should influence clinical treatment decisions as well as help inform research priorities and clinical study design. In short, treatments could be individualized on the basis of the underlying cause of OSA; patients could better understand which symptoms and outcomes will respond to OSA treatment and by how much; and researchers could select populations most likely to benefit from specific treatment approaches for OSA.

### Does gender matter: Sex-specific aspects of symptoms, outcome, and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea [^112sMCbM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), historically regarded as a male disease. Female individuals have often been underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to their male counterparts. However, recent data suggest that several OSA-associated adverse cardiovascular outcomes are more pronounced in women.

Recent findings provide a summary of the most relevant recent evidence regarding sex-specific OSA characteristics. This includes atypical symptoms, greater quality of life impairment, and several more pronounced adverse outcomes in female individuals compared to male individuals. The review also offers updated evidence on the influence of female gender on the undertreatment of OSA, with limited evidence supporting gender differences in the effects of OSA treatment.

There is evidence suggesting gender-based differences in the frequency, severity, clinical presentation, and outcomes of OSA. Recognizing these gender differences could improve screening through the development of female-specific screening instruments, early diagnosis, and individualized therapeutic plans towards better disease management and outcomes.

### Mild obstructive sleep apnoea: Clinical relevance and approaches to management [^116xwjk4]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is highly prevalent in the general population worldwide, especially in its mild form. Clinical manifestations correlate poorly with disease severity measured by the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), which complicates diagnosis. Full polysomnography might be more appropriate to assess suspected mild cases because limited ambulatory diagnostic systems are least accurate for mild disease. Treatment options in mild obstructive sleep apnoea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oral appliance therapy, in addition to positional therapy and weight reduction when appropriate. The superior efficacy of CPAP in reducing AHI is offset by greater tolerance of oral appliances, especially in mild disease. Although severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with adverse health consequences, including cardiometabolic comorbidities, the association with mild disease is unclear, and reports differ regarding the clinical relevance of mild obstructive sleep apnoea. Improved diagnostic techniques and evidence-based approaches to management in mild obstructive sleep apnoea require further research.

### Diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^113Hxugf]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obstructive sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: OSA is a condition characterized by recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to cyclic reduction or cessation in airflow.

- **Pathophysiology**: OSA is caused by periods of dynamic airway collapse during sleep. Factors that increase the risk of collapse include obesity, male sex, postmenopausal state, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, maxillary insufficiency, retrognathia, polycystic ovarian disease, androgen supplementation, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15) in adults (30–70 years of age) is estimated at 13% in men and 6% in women.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations of OSA include reduced sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Long-term complications include arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiovascular events, stroke, impaired cognitive function, depression, and even premature death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Regular CPAP use is associated with an improvement in sleep apnea symptoms and health-related quality of life. Randomized studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Epidemiology, risk factors, and consequences of obstructive sleep apnea and short sleep duration [^113427yo]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We will review the epidemiology, risk factors, and consequences of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and short/long sleep duration. Obstructive sleep apnea is a disease characterized by upper airway obstruction during sleep. It is common, with moderate to severe disease present in approximately 9% of middle-aged men and 4% of women. The prevalence of OSA in certain patient populations, such as elderly patients, hypertensive patients, patients with coronary disease, and pre-bariatric surgery patients, is even greater. There are several risk factors for the disease, including obesity, male sex, and family history.

Obstructive sleep apnea negatively impacts quality of life and is associated with numerous adverse safety and health consequences, including cardiovascular disease and motor vehicle crashes. Short habitual sleep duration can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and reduced neurocognitive function. Sleep loss may have long-term health consequences and may lead to premature death, cardiovascular disease, and the development of diabetes.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nonsleepy apnea [^112XDMmN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and observational studies suggest that sleep-disordered breathing is associated with the subsequent development of hypertension and ultimately with cardiovascular consequences. It may therefore be assumed that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) not only avoids sleep-related symptoms but could also mitigate cardiovascular consequences. Short-term studies have revealed a drop in blood pressure, especially in more severe, symptomatic cases of obstructive sleep apnea. Two recent studies have reported that nonsleepy obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an absence of reduced blood pressure after CPAP treatment. This suggests that this group of patients is less susceptible to the consequences of apneas, even those with mild-moderate hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders. However, in patients with severe cardiovascular disease or a higher number of obstructive events, CPAP treatment should be seriously considered.

### Comparative efficacy, safety and benefit/risk of alerting agents for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: A network meta-analysis [^111KJmhA]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common clinical condition characterized by partial or complete pharyngeal collapses occurring repeatedly during sleep, causing apnoeas and hypopnoeas. This leads to intermittent hypoxia and sleep disruption. Nearly 1 billion people are affected globally, and the disease is associated with a high prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities impacting prognosis. OSA is associated with a substantial economic societal burden, with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) being a recognized risk factor for motor vehicle accidents. EDS may persist despite first-line treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Approximately 13% of patients treated with CPAP experience residual daytime sleepiness, with complex and multiple pathogenesis often associated with comorbid conditions such as insufficient sleep and depression. EDS can be evaluated using the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) or with objective tests such as the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Oxford Sleep Resistance (OSLER) test.

Several pharmacologic treatments for OSA-related EDS are available. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that modafinil and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant are effective in improving EDS. Modafinil, armodafinil, and solriamfetol are approved in the United States for the treatment of EDS in adults with OSA. Regulatory approval for modafinil/armodafinil for this indication was withdrawn by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011 due to safety concerns.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^112cZSPf]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a significant clinical and public health issue because it contributes to harmful effects on quality of life, daytime symptoms, road traffic incidents, and cardiometabolic disease. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnoea is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with patients displaying varied susceptibility to long-term complications and different responses to treatment. This narrative review summarizes the knowledge of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea, particularly the role of symptom clusters, polysomnogram phenotypes, physiological endotypes, and circulating biomarkers in defining subtypes. In the near future, the prognostic accuracy of these measures in predicting long-term complications in obstructive sleep apnoea will likely be improved, alongside better matching of treatments to disease subtypes.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116EFF7p]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, particularly concerning its relationship with cardiovascular diseases, the 2021 American Heart Association guidelines recommend considering a sleep study if the following concerning signs or symptoms of sleep apnea are present:

- **NYHA class II-IV heart failure symptoms**: These indicate varying degrees of heart failure, all of which should prompt further investigation for sleep apnea.
- **Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome**: This condition involves abnormal heart rates, which may be indicative of underlying sleep apnea.
- **Sick sinus syndrome**: A disorder affecting the sinus node, pointing towards a possible sleep apnea diagnosis.
- **Ventricular tachycardia**: This fast heart rhythm may warrant screening for obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Survivors of sudden cardiac death**: Individuals with a history of sudden cardiac events are at an increased risk and may benefit from a sleep study.
- **Stroke**: Post-stroke patients should be assessed for obstructive sleep apnea as part of their ongoing care.
