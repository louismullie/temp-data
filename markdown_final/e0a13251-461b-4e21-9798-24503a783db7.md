## Question

For a patient with a history of MS who has orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope, what cardiology workup is recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what cardiology workup is recommended for a patient with MS who has orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational initial assessment, including history, physical exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG. Then, I should define orthostatic hypotension criteria and perform risk stratification, distinguishing neurogenic from non-neurogenic causes. Next, I will map high- versus low-risk cardiac testing pathways. After that, I will consider advanced autonomic testing and MS-specific nuances, including POTS and tilt responses. Finally, I will integrate differential diagnosis, medication effects, and outline mechanism-specific management and follow-up with monitoring strategies [^113q4c52] [^111JYUVe] [^114yzfK9].

> Let me first confirm the core initial evaluation elements so I do not miss a high-risk cardiac cause. A careful history targeting triggers, prodrome, position at onset, frequency, and recovery, coupled with a thorough physical exam and orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate after 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes of standing, is mandatory; wait, is it 2 or 3 minutes for defining orthostatic hypotension, I should double-check and yes, guidelines specify 3 minutes for the diagnostic window. A 12‑lead ECG is essential for all patients to screen for conduction disease or ischemia that would alter the diagnostic path. These steps are explicitly endorsed by ESC 2018, EFNS 2006, and AAFP 2023, and I need to ensure symptoms during standing are documented to correlate physiology with complaints [^113q4c52] [^111JYUVe] [^114yzfK9].

> Next, I should verify the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension and align terminology. Syncope due to orthostatic hypotension is supported when there is a sustained fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or a decrease in systolic blood pressure to below 90 mmHg, reproducing spontaneous symptoms; hold on, let me verify whether asymptomatic drops count, and ESC allows suspicion when the hemodynamic pattern matches orthostatic hypotension even if symptoms are recalled historically, but confirmation is stronger when symptoms co-occur with the measured drop. I should also distinguish neurogenic orthostatic hypotension by inadequate heart rate compensation and signs of autonomic failure, while keeping in mind exceptions in pacemaker patients or those on rate-limiting drugs [^112DCV2o] [^111q7NNp] [^111jn2Ym].

> I need to stratify cardiac risk before assuming a purely autonomic cause. High-risk features such as abnormal ECG, known structural heart disease, exercise-related syncope, family history of sudden death, or severe recurrent injury-producing syncope should prompt urgent cardiac evaluation. Conversely, typical prodrome with a clear orthostatic blood pressure drop, no cardiac history, and a normal ECG support an autonomic mechanism. Let me check myself here and avoid premature closure; if any red flags appear, I will escalate cardiac testing right away per guideline pathways rather than proceeding directly to autonomic testing [^113q4c52] [^114yzfK9].

> Now, I should integrate MS-specific considerations because autonomic dysfunction is common in MS. Evidence suggests a high prevalence of pathological responses on tilt in relapsing-remitting MS, with approximately 63 percent showing abnormal orthostatic reactions, more syncope during remission, and more POTS during relapse, with correlations to EDSS, though I need to acknowledge the study's lower evidence grade and potential selection bias. Still, this increases pretest probability for neurogenic orthostatic patterns in this population and justifies early collaboration with neurology for autonomic evaluation and medication review [^115oBePB] [^117Xfdak].

> If high-risk cardiac features are present or the ECG is abnormal, I will direct testing accordingly. Ambulatory rhythm monitoring with Holter for frequent symptoms or event/implantable loop recorder for infrequent events can uncover intermittent arrhythmias, while echocardiography assesses structural disease and ventricular function, and exercise testing evaluates ischemia or exertional arrhythmias. I need to check whether an electrophysiology study is indicated; yes, it is generally reserved for conduction disease or unexplained syncope with high-risk features after noninvasive testing. If the initial evaluation is low risk and points to orthostatic intolerance, I should avoid unnecessary cardiac imaging and proceed to autonomic testing instead [^113q4c52] [^112mjCmW].

> For low-risk patients with suspected orthostatic or reflex mechanisms, I will now examine advanced autonomic and orthostatic testing. Head-up tilt testing is appropriate when the active standing test is negative but clinical suspicion remains, when differentiating reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension, POTS, or psychogenic pseudosyncope, and when education may help patients recognize prodromes. Wait, I should also note the reinterpretation literature that tilt demonstrates hypotensive susceptibility rather than disease-specific diagnosis; that does not negate its utility but reframes its role in mechanism profiling and patient training. Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate monitoring improves diagnostic yield, particularly for initial orthostatic hypotension or delayed blood pressure recovery patterns [^113q4c52] [^116HTBiU] [^113Bs5qW] [^111uYiUy].

> During tilt and standing assessments, I should confirm patterns explicitly. Classic orthostatic hypotension manifests within 3 minutes, initial orthostatic hypotension within about 15 seconds necessitating beat-to-beat capture, delayed orthostatic hypotension occurs after 3 minutes, and POTS is defined by an orthostatic heart rate rise over 30 bpm (over 40 bpm in adolescents) or an absolute heart rate above 120 bpm without orthostatic hypotension and reproducing symptoms. Let me double-check that I am not swapping POTS criteria timing; yes, criteria apply within 10 minutes of standing in the absence of orthostatic hypotension per ESC guidance [^114d7mkK] [^116C7kKC] [^113q4c52].

> If neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is suspected, I should confirm with autonomic reflex testing where available. Heart rate variability to paced breathing, Valsalva responses with beat-to-beat blood pressure, and baroreflex assessment can demonstrate autonomic failure, and plasma catecholamines can be considered in specialized settings to characterize the noradrenergic deficit. Hold on, I need to ensure that a blunted heart rate response alone does not overcall neurogenic disease, particularly in patients with rate-limiting drugs or cardiac devices; the full clinical context and medication reconciliation are essential to avoid misclassification [^111jn2Ym] [^115f5hXG] [^112ZH7wi].

> I should also consider laboratory studies and targeted imaging judiciously. Checking hemoglobin, electrolytes, and glucose helps rule out anemia and metabolic precipitants, while volume status assessment distinguishes hypovolemic orthostatic hypotension from neurogenic forms. Ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring can document intermittent hypotension and delayed patterns and can link symptoms to blood pressure behavior over the day when clinic tests are inconclusive. Let me verify guideline support for ambulatory monitoring in syncope pathways; ESC 2018 does support considering ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring to detect abnormally low blood pressure during suspected orthostatic intolerance [^111JYUVe] [^1173JiKz].

> But wait, medications can distort the picture and must be reviewed meticulously. Atypical antipsychotics, among other agents, can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during initiation and up-titration, so I need to check for drugs like cariprazine, asenapine transdermal, or brexpiprazole and consider dose adjustment or alternatives when appropriate, with orthostatic vital monitoring during changes. This step is particularly relevant in patients with dizziness and falls, where iatrogenic contributors are common and modifiable [^112Vtr17] [^114tPNyw] [^116TDEG4].

> Management should be mechanism-specific and stepwise, starting with education and nonpharmacologic therapy. I should advise increased water intake to about 2 to 2.5 liters per day and liberal salt intake when not contraindicated, teach physical counter-pressure maneuvers, consider head-up tilt sleeping above 10 degrees for volume expansion, and recommend avoidance of precipitants such as rapid postural changes and large carbohydrate meals. Let me confirm the acute rescue strategies; advising rapid water ingestion can provide temporary relief in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension during prodrome. Reassessment of orthostatic vitals after medication changes is prudent to document response and adjust the strategy iteratively [^113oZczM] [^117UP6Bb] [^1177KQVw] [^112mSbch].

> If symptoms persist despite optimal nonpharmacologic measures, I should initiate pharmacologic therapy tailored to a hypotensive phenotype. Midodrine is a first-line pressor with typical starting doses around 2.5 mg three times daily titrated to effect, and fludrocortisone can be first-line monotherapy or combined to expand intravascular volume while monitoring for supine hypertension and hypokalemia; I need to check for cardiac contraindications before use. For refractory neurogenic orthostatic hypotension with syncope, droxidopa is guideline-supported, and pyridostigmine can be considered as adjunctive therapy in selected cases. I should verify the sequence and selection based on comorbidities, supine hypertension, and patient preference through shared decision-making [^113sJq7p] [^115UjaoT] [^113nF6sS] [^112JWj2w] [^115KfJp8].

> Education and rehabilitation are integral to reduce recurrence and injury. Using tilt testing as a teaching tool helps patients recognize prodromal cues and implement counter-maneuvers, while physical therapy can reinforce graded orthostatic conditioning and safety strategies. I need to ensure multidisciplinary coordination with neurology for MS-related autonomic dysfunction and with cardiology to exclude primary cardiac causes before attributing syncope to autonomic failure, which aligns with guideline recommendations for neurologic involvement in autonomic failure [^1177KQVw] [^117Xfdak] [^113q4c52].

> As a synthesized algorithm, I should confirm that every patient receives a history, exam with orthostatic vitals, and ECG first, then stratify risk. High-risk or ECG-abnormal cases proceed to echocardiography, ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and selected electrophysiology as indicated, while low-risk cases with typical orthostatic features go to advanced autonomic testing including head-up tilt with continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Throughout, I need to integrate MS-specific autonomic vulnerability into pretest probability, review and adjust hypotensive medications, and apply mechanism-specific therapy emphasizing nonpharmacologic foundations with pharmacologic escalation when needed, followed by periodic reassessment and home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to track control and detect delayed patterns [^113q4c52] [^111JYUVe] [^1173JiKz] [^115oBePB].

For MS patients with orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, or syncope, the cardiology workup should start with a **focused history and physical examination** and **orthostatic vital signs** (supine and standing BP/HR) to confirm OH and exclude cardiac causes [^114yzfK9] [^111JYUVe]. Obtain a **12-lead ECG** for arrhythmias or conduction disease, and use echocardiography if structural heart disease is suspected. If initial studies are inconclusive, perform **tilt-table testing** to differentiate neurogenic OH from other causes [^113q4c52]. Ambulatory ECG monitoring or implantable loop recorders are indicated for intermittent symptoms or suspected arrhythmias. Management is **multidisciplinary**, combining **nonpharmacologic** measures (increased fluids/salt, compression garments, head-up tilt sleeping) and **pharmacologic therapy** (midodrine, fludrocortisone, droxidopa) as needed [^113sJq7p] [^113nF6sS].

---

## Initial clinical evaluation

### Detailed history and physical examination

The history should characterize dizziness or syncope — covering triggers, prodrome, duration, recovery, and frequency — and include a **medication review** (antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, antipsychotics) for agents that may worsen orthostatic hypotension [^114yzfK9] [^112ZH7wi]. The physical examination focuses on the cardiovascular system and should include **orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements** (supine after 5 minutes, then at 1 and 3 minutes standing) [^111JYUVe].

---

### Orthostatic blood pressure measurement

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or during head-up tilt [^112DCV2o]. In multiple sclerosis, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is suggested by an **inadequate heart rate increase of less than 15 bpm** despite a significant blood pressure drop.

---

## Essential cardiological tests

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Obtain a **12-lead ECG** to detect arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, or ischemia that may cause syncope [^111JYUVe]. This test is a standard component of the initial evaluation.

---

### Echocardiography

Order **transthoracic echocardiography** when structural heart disease is suspected — such as valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure. Imaging helps identify structural contributors to syncope.

---

### Ambulatory ECG monitoring

Use **Holter or event monitors** to evaluate intermittent symptoms or suspected arrhythmias not captured on a standard ECG. Consider implantable loop recorders for infrequent, severe episodes when an arrhythmia is suspected.

---

### Tilt-table testing

Perform **tilt-table testing** when the initial evaluation is inconclusive, to differentiate neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from reflex syncope or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^113q4c52]. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is characterized by a significant blood pressure drop with minimal heart rate increase during tilt [^112ZH7wi].

---

## Additional autonomic function tests

Consider **Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, and sudomotor testing** to assess the severity of autonomic dysfunction [^115f5hXG]. These tests help characterize the extent of autonomic impairment.

---

## Management strategies

### Nonpharmacological interventions

- **Fluids/salt**: Increase fluid (2–2.5 L/day) and salt intake (> 8 g/day) [^113oZczM].

- **Compression**: Use compression stockings or abdominal binders [^113oZczM].

- **Head-up tilt**: Elevate head of bed > 10° to reduce nocturnal diuresis and morning OH [^117UP6Bb].

- **Counter-pressure**: Teach physical maneuvers (leg crossing, squatting) [^116vWgWS].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Midodrine**: Alpha-agonist to increase vascular tone; first-line for neurogenic OH [^112JWj2w].

- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid to expand plasma volume; first-line or adjunct [^113sJq7p].

- **Droxidopa**: Norepinephrine precursor for refractory neurogenic OH [^113nF6sS].

- **Pyridostigmine**: Cholinesterase inhibitor for refractory cases [^115KfJp8].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

Coordinate care among **cardiology, neurology, and autonomic specialists** for comprehensive evaluation and management [^112ZH7wi]. Provide patient education and schedule regular follow-up to monitor response and adjust therapy [^112ZH7wi].

A **structured cardiology workup** — history, orthostatic vitals, ECG, echocardiography, ambulatory monitoring, and tilt testing — is essential for confirming OH, excluding cardiac causes, and guiding therapy in MS patients with dizziness or syncope. Management should be multidisciplinary, combining nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies tailored to neurogenic OH.

### Twenty-eight years of research permit reinterpretation of tilt-testing: Hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis [^113Bs5qW]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing skepticism over the utility of tilt-testing for syncope diagnosis, as it has been shown unable to distinguish vasovagal syncope from other types, especially cardiac syncope, despite its acceptable sensitivity and specificity in true positive and negative subjects. The new interpretation suggests that the test reveals a susceptibility to reflex hypotension, which may exist in conjunction with any cause of syncope. This implies an important change in patient management, including the selection of effective therapy, particularly in guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reflex syncope.

### The neuromuscular evaluation of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^111svGfG]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a diagnosis with a wide spectrum of symptomatology and a variety of clinicopathological associations, including hereditary, autoimmune, and infectious associations. There is little consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach to the condition. The aim of this work was to provide guidance on the initial diagnosis and when and how to expand diagnostic testing.

We define the "typical" POTS patient as younger, female, and with a normal examination apart from joint hyperextensibility. Red flags for "atypical" POTS would be older age at onset, male, prominent syncope, review of systems suggestive of specific alternative diagnoses, examination abnormalities other than joint hyperextensibility, or disease refractory to nonpharmacological and other first-line treatments.

Although a limited evaluation is appropriate in POTS with typical features, we recommend an expanded and individualized workup in atypical cases, including additional cardiac testing, autonomic testing, neuropathy workup, and/or autoimmune workup (including consideration of Guillain-Barré syndrome), depending on clinical presentation. We emphasize the importance of shared decision-making in this condition for which treatment remains primarily symptomatic regardless of etiology.

### Secuado [^114tPNyw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and other hemodynamic effects**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose.

	- In the placebo-controlled trial, orthostatic hypotension was reported in 1.5% (3/204) of patients treated with Secuado 3.8 mg/24 hours and 0% (0/204) of patients treated with Secuado 7.6 mg/24 hours, compared to < 1% (1/206) of patients treated with placebo. There were no reports of syncope for both doses of Secuado in the placebo-controlled trial.

	- During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with sublingual asenapine, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, syncope was reported in 0.6% (11/1953) of patients treated with sublingual asenapine.

	- Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, or those receiving concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications. Patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities) and patients with cerebrovascular disease should also be monitored. Secuado should be used cautiously when treating patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory, or central nervous system depression [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction may be necessary.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^117AT4jJ]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by a failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission, which is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems, such as the bowel and the bladder. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, occurring with or without signs of an underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed via an orthostatic challenge and is characterized by a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age-dependent, ranging from 5% in patients 70 years of age and older. OH can complicate the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; cause disabling symptoms, fainting, and traumatic injuries; and substantially reduce quality of life.

Despite often being largely asymptomatic or presenting with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population. We also summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate challenges and future perspectives.

### Assessment of prevalence and pathological response to orthostatic provocation in patients with multiple sclerosis [^115oBePB]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pathologic response to orthostatic challenge in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and the difference of the response in patients in relapse and remission.

- **Patients and methods**: We included 112 RRMS patients; group 1 included 53 patients in a relapse and group 2, 59 patients in remission. The head-up tilt table test was used to provoke an orthostatic reaction.

- **Results**: 71 (63%) patients (60.4% and 66% of relapse and remission subjects respectively) had a pathological response to orthostatic provocation. Syncope was found in 9 (17%) patients in group 1 compared to 22 (37.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.014). Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was found in 17 (32%) patients in group 1 compared to 4 (6.8%) in group 2 (p = 0.001). There was a significantly negative correlation between the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and POTS (-0.201; p = 0.034) and a positive correlation between the EDSS and syncope (0.190; p = 0.044).

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of distinct types of orthostatic autonomic dysfunction in different phases of RRMS seems to be in direct correlation with the EDSS. Furthermore, certain autonomic dysfunctions of orthostasis, more specifically syncope and POTS, tend to be increased in remission and relapse respectively.

### Orthostatic syndromes differ in syncope frequency [^114U1cPo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There are conflicting opinions on whether postural tachycardia syndrome predisposes individuals to syncope. We investigated this relationship by comparing the frequency of syncope in postural tachycardia syndrome and orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We queried our autonomic laboratory database of 3,700 patients. Orthostatic hypotension and postural tachycardia syndrome were defined in a standard fashion, except that postural tachycardia syndrome required the presence of orthostatic symptoms and a further increase in heart rate beyond 10 minutes. Syncope was defined as an abrupt decrease in blood pressure and often, heart rate, requiring termination of the tilt study. Statistical analysis utilized Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test, as appropriate.

- **Results**: Of 810 patients referred for postural tachycardia syndrome, 185 met criteria while another 328 patients had orthostatic hypotension. Of the postural tachycardia syndrome patients, 38% had syncope on head-up tilt, compared with only 22% of those with orthostatic hypotension (P < .0001). In the postural tachycardia group, syncope on head-up tilt was associated with a clinical history of syncope in 90%, whereas absence of syncope on head-up tilt was associated with a clinical history of syncope in 30% (P < .0001). In contrast, syncope on head-up tilt did not bear any relationship to clinical history of syncope in the orthostatic hypotension group (41% vs. 36%; p = 0.49).

- **Conclusion**: Our results demonstrate that syncope, both tilt table and clinical, occurs far more commonly in patients who have postural tachycardia syndrome.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^115B3bRU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man was evaluated for a 2-year history of syncope, collapse, and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medical history included Hodgkin lymphoma, lupus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autonomic neuropathy, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and orthostatic hypotension. He was being treated with gabapentin (300 mg, two times per day), saxagliptin (5 mg, once per day), pravastatin (40 mg, once per day), levothyroxine sodium (100 mg, once per day), omeprazole (20 mg, once per day), prednisone (10 mg, every other day), midodrine (10 mg, three times per day), and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day).

At the time of his initial evaluation, the patient reported that his syncope had progressively worsened over the past 3 months. Although his episodes of syncope were previously preceded by dizziness and nausea, they had begun to occur without warning. He also reported a 5-year history of orthostatic hypotension, with a supine BP of approximately 100/66 mm Hg and a standing BP as low as 50/40 mm Hg. His low standing BP and episodes of syncope persisted despite daily treatment with fludrocortisone and midodrine.

- **Clinical evaluation**: Initial cardiac evaluation revealed a systolic murmur but was otherwise unremarkable.

Other than orthostatic hypotension, a clinical manifestation of possible cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, no other signs of autonomic dysfunction were noted during examination. Additionally, the patient showed no signs of hypovolemia (i.e. extremities were not cold, moist mucous membranes, no increase in urine specific gravity) or of amyloidosis (i.e. lack of tongue swelling).

### Cardiovascular risk after hospitalisation for unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^112sh5qT]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Ascertainment of clinical endpoints - **Study participants**: All participants were followed up through December 31, 2011, by linking a unique 10-digit personal identification number with the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register (SNHDR), Swedish National Cause of Death Register (SNCDR), and Stroke Register of Malmö (STROMA). Event-free subjects (n = 284; 0.9%) who emigrated from Sweden before December 31, 2011, were assigned the date of emigration as their last follow-up date.

- **Primary outcomes**: We examined two primary outcomes: (1) first-time hospital admission for unexplained syncope or orthostatic hypotension (OH) and (2) first-ever cardiovascular (CV) event, defined as a coronary event, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and aortic valve stenosis.

- **Secondary outcomes**: We also analyzed two secondary outcomes: CV death and all-cause mortality.

- **Data collection**: Data on first-time hospitalization for unexplained syncope or OH were based on primary or main secondary discharge diagnoses according to the ICD-9/10 system (syncope: ICD-9 = 780.2, and ICD-10 = R550.9; OH: ICD-9 = 458 and ICD-10 = I951) as retrieved from SNHDR. Cases with concurrent CV diagnoses identified as the primary cause of admission, such as acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina), stroke or transient ischemic attack, cardiac arrhythmia, acute decompensated heart failure, and valvular heart disease were excluded. If the hospital admission was recorded for both unexplained syncope and OH, the event was classified as OH-related, as an in-hospital OH diagnosis warrants a positive orthostatic test.

### Implanted system for orthostatic hypotension in multiple-system atrophy [^112VBSpk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a cardinal feature of multiple-system atrophy. The upright posture provokes syncopal episodes that prevent patients from standing and walking for more than brief periods. We implanted a system to restore regulation of blood pressure and enable a patient with multiple-system atrophy to stand and walk after having lost these abilities because of orthostatic hypotension. This system involved epidural electrical stimulation delivered over the thoracic spinal cord with accelerometers that detected changes in body position.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KF1s6]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension may present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. Although these conditions do not directly increase mortality, they can significantly impair patients' daily lives. This impact includes both physical symptoms and injuries, as well as a psychological burden from the fear of future syncopal episodes. Despite their similarities, these disorders differ: neurogenic orthostatic hypotension involves fixed damage to the autonomic nerves, while vasovagal syncope is characterized by transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" scenarios.

The treatment approaches for both disorders are similar. Initially, educating the patient about their disorder's pathophysiology and prognosis is essential. When possible, discontinuing offending medications is recommended. Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be employed to prevent symptoms and address syncope at the onset of presyncope. For many patients with vasovagal syncope, this may suffice. If necessary, pharmacological options are available for both disorders, focusing on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or using pressor agents to enhance vascular tone. There is a scarcity of high-quality clinical trial data supporting the efficacy of these pharmacological agents. This review aims to examine the literature on various therapeutic choices and provide recommendations for tailored treatment strategies.

### Syncope [^114CCpXx]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical presentation. Although most commonly benign, it may herald a pathology with a poor prognosis. The work-up of syncope includes a careful history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, risk stratification, and appropriately directed testing. The key factor in the investigation of syncope is the presence (or absence) of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram. The most useful investigation in unexplained syncope with a normal heart is the tilt table test for evaluating predisposition to neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. In the setting of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram, electrophysiologic studies play a more important role. The utility of noninvasive cardiac monitoring for symptom-rhythm correlation may be limited by infrequent symptoms. The availability of external and implantable loop recorders allows prolonged periods of monitoring to increase diagnostic yield. The management of patients with syncope may be complex. Early referral to a cardiac electrophysiologist is warranted in patients who are at high risk.

### Clinical laboratory testing: What is the role of tilt-table testing, active standing test, carotid massage, electrophysiological testing and ATP test in the syncope evaluation [^115M81P7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected syncope begins with an "initial evaluation" consisting of careful history taking, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressure measurement, and electrocardiogram. However, even in expert centers, the diagnostic yield of this "initial evaluation" is only approximately 50%. In the remaining cases, where a satisfactory diagnosis is either unknown or uncertain after the initial assessment, additional clinical testing is needed. This article reviews the role of some of the more commonly used additional diagnostic tests, including: tilt-table testing, the active standing test, carotid sinus massage, electrophysiological testing, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test. The role of angiography, exercise testing, and imaging is noted briefly. Other clinical laboratory investigations, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring, are examined in other papers in this issue. In brief, clinical laboratory tests, carefully interpreted, may be useful in evaluating the basis of suspected syncope. However, these tests should be selected carefully and performed based on the pre-test probability inferred from the initial examination, with the less invasive tests used first.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common but often overlooked disorder with multiple causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to ascertain the underlying diagnosis causing OH, treat accompanying conditions, and provide individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.

- **Proposed classification**: We propose a novel, streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH.
- **Cardiovascular relationship**: Review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH.
- **End-organ damage**: Discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage.
- **Clinical algorithms**: Provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision-making and patient care.
- **Knowledge gaps**: Identify gaps in knowledge and attempt to define future research directions.

Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented to highlight various presentations of OH, providing a practical guide for evaluating and managing patients with OH.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^117NDwZD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

One hundred and sixteen patients consented to participate. Measurements were suitable for analysis in 111 patients (median age 63 ± 30 years, 51% male). Five measurements were excluded due to poor quality signals (artefacts) or signal interruptions. Sixty-six (59%) patients were referred because of syncope and 45 (41%) patients because of presyncope.

Fifty-seven percent of the 111 patients had a normal BP recovery, 7% had initial orthostatic hypotension, 13% delayed BP recovery, 19% classic orthostatic hypotension, and 4% had reflex-mediated hypotension. Haemodynamic profiles of the different patterns are depicted in figure 2.

- **Patient's characteristics based on orthostatic BP recovery patterns**: Haemodynamic profiles of the different orthostatic BP recovery patterns include continuous non-invasive orthostatic BP measurement in 111 patients with (pre)syncope. Median BP and HR values are presented at baseline, nadir, 30, 60, 120, and 180 seconds after standing up. Orthostatic BP recovery patterns are classified as normal BP recovery (n = 63), initial orthostatic hypotension (n = 8), delayed BP recovery (n = 14), classic orthostatic hypotension (n = 21), and reflex-mediated hypotension (n = 5).

Seven out of 45 (16%) patients classified by the attending physician as vasovagal syncope had classic orthostatic hypotension with continuous BP measurement. In patients classified as having orthostatic hypotension by the attending physician, 11 out of 18 (61%) had a positive test for classic orthostatic hypotension. In patients with a delayed BP recovery, 6 out of 14 (43%) were classified accordingly.

### Early and late-onset syncope: Insight into mechanisms [^11614Fuu]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The first-ever syncope incidence in patients with unexplained syncope has a bimodal lifetime pattern with peaks at 15 and 70 years. The majority of older patients experience their first syncope later in life, with orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome being more common in this group. In older patients with early-onset syncope, prodromes, vasovagal, and complex syncope are more prevalent. A detailed syncope history remains essential in elderly patients evaluated for syncope and impacts the final diagnosis.

### Evaluation of syncope [^112mjCmW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Though relatively common, syncope is a complex presenting symptom defined by a transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by falling, with spontaneous recovery. Syncope must be carefully differentiated from other conditions that may cause a loss of consciousness or falling. Syncope can be classified into four categories: reflex mediated, cardiac, orthostatic, and cerebrovascular. A cardiac cause of syncope is associated with significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality than other causes.

The evaluation of syncope begins with a careful history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. Additional testing should be based on the initial clinical evaluation. Older patients and those with underlying organic heart disease or abnormal electrocardiograms generally will need additional cardiac evaluation, which may include prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing. When structural heart disease is excluded, tests for neurogenic reflex-mediated syncope, such as head-up tilt-table testing and carotid sinus massage, should be performed. The use of tests such as head computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, carotid and transcranial ultrasonography, and electroencephalography to detect cerebrovascular causes of syncope should be reserved for those few patients whose history suggests a neurologic event or who have focal neurologic signs or symptoms.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115dLWq1]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients' quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, NOH is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115DQAx7]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by the failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission and is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies.

This condition is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems, such as the bowel and the bladder. In the present review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^111p8b7o]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Impaired orthostatic blood pressure response and syncope confer a high risk of falls and trauma. The relationship between a history of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension (OH) with subsequent fractures, however, has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between previous hospital admissions due to unexplained syncope and OH and incident fractures in a middle-aged population.

- **Methods**: We analysed a large population-based prospective cohort of 30,399 middle-aged individuals (age, 57.5 ± 7.6; women, 60.2%). We included individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope or OH as the main diagnosis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the impact of unexplained syncope and OH hospitalisations on subsequent incident fractures.

- **Results**: During a follow-up period of 17.8 ± 6.5 years, 8,201 (27%) subjects suffered incident fractures. The mean time from baseline and first admission for syncope (n = 493) or OH (n = 406) was 12.6 ± 4.2 years, and the mean age of the first hospitalisation was 74.6 ± 7.4 years. Individuals with incident fractures were older, more likely to be women, and had lower BMI, higher prevalence of prevalent fractures, and a family history of fractures. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression showed an increased risk of incident fractures following hospitalisations due to unexplained syncope (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.02–1.40; p = 0.025) and OH (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.21–1.66; p < 0.001) compared with unaffected individuals.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension showed a significant increase in the risk of incident fractures.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or non-neurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks, either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms.

Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and non-neurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that serves as an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition where autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms such as orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, further complicating the diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope/collapse [^113iy3LK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging, and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive the investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing.

All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination, as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation, and no further investigation is required. In the remaining patients, targeted use of additional investigations, such as cardiac imaging, provocative testing, and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield and ensures efficient usage of limited healthcare resources.

### Mechanism of syncope: Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^114EJkZ6]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Different types of transient loss of consciousness events are defined based on their pathophysiological features. The qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion, which differentiates syncope from non-syncopal forms such as epileptic seizure or psychogenic pseudo syncope. In patients with a diagnosis of syncope, once a cardiac cause (such as primary intrinsic cardiac arrhythmias or structural flow obstruction) can be ruled out, autonomic neural mechanisms are involved in the genesis of non-cardiac forms. Autonomic (non-cardiac) syncope encompasses both reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, as described in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Identifying the haemodynamic mechanism of autonomic syncope is the essential prerequisite for a personalized treatment approach aimed at effectively preventing recurrences. The possible haemodynamic mechanisms underlying autonomic syncope include primary hypotension and asystole/bradycardia of extrinsic cause, corresponding to two different haemodynamic phenotypes: the hypotensive and bradycardic phenotypes. The choice of therapy — aiming at counteracting hypotension or bradycardia — depends on the detected syncope phenotype identified during the diagnostic work-up.

Autonomic syncope is a common event in the general population and a frequent reason for seeking medical attention, with a consequent impact on high healthcare costs. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, syncope might be disabling due to recurrent episodes and/or severe injuries.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017).

- **Diagnosis of nOH in individuals who screen positive for OH**: After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for the diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Diagnostic tests for nOH**:
	- **Blood pressure testing**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from a supine position, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on baseline blood pressure.

- **A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing**:
	- **In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 minutes after standing.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117RMMnV]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this large prospective, population-based, observational study, the risk of incident fractures following hospitalizations due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension increased by 20% and 42%, respectively. Thus, the effect size of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension on the risk of fractures in our cohort is similar to that of several established risk factors for fractures, such as smoking and family history of fractures.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of the study**: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective observational study investigating the association between incident fractures following hospitalizations due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension. The strength of this study is the use of a large population-based cohort with over 30,000 middle-aged individuals enrolled and minimal loss to follow-up. Moreover, data on hospitalizations due to syncope and orthostatic hypotension were retrieved from a national register with complete coverage of public healthcare in Sweden, making our findings reliable and robust. Previous studies have focused on examining the association between unexplained falls in individuals with syncope and orthostatic hypotension. Our findings provide additional knowledge related to the importance of fracture prevention in the population. The mortality in the MDC cohort has been explored in several previous studies. For example, a recent study showed that the cumulative survival after 10 years is around 90%. A previous study from our research group concluded that syncope and orthostatic hypotension increased the risk of…

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KhkhR]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

During the follow-up period (mean time of 17.8 ± 6.5 years), a total of 8201 subjects (27%) experienced at least one fracture. Individuals with incident fractures were older, more likely to be women, and had lower BMI, higher prevalence of previous fractures, and a family history of fractures. Baseline characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population stratified according to hospitalisations due to orthostatic hypotension and unexplained syncope can be found in Supplementary Table S1.

- **Baseline characteristics of the study population (n = 30,399) stratified according to the presence of incident fractures**:

	p-values for differences were all < 0.001.

	- **Abbreviations**: BMI - body mass index; DBP - diastolic blood pressure; SBP - systolic blood pressure; SD - standard deviation.

The mean time between baseline and the first admission for syncope and orthostatic hypotension was 12.6 ± 4.2 years, while the mean age at the time of the first hospitalisation was 74.6 ± 7.4 years. In total, 493 and 406 individuals were hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension, respectively. In the two groups, 49.9% and 50.2% were female, respectively. The mean age at baseline for individuals with unexplained syncope was 61.5 ± 7.1 years, and for those with orthostatic hypotension, it was 62.6 ± 6.6 years.

Individuals previously hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension had a higher incidence of fractures (log-rank test: p < 0.001). The survival curves for both groups began to diverge from the control group around this time.

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: A novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^111eKhmZ]. Heart (2021). High credibility.

This article provides guidance on identifying and managing patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes such as trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes, or frequent recurrences that reduce quality of life. The first step in syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope. Once established, these patients must receive the appropriate mechanism-specific treatment. If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, the efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its etiology or clinical features.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to a hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy (counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia).
- **Therapeutic results**: Results of recent trials indicate that 'mechanism-specific therapy' is highly effective in preventing recurrences. Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include the withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype, and cardiac pacing in the bradycardic phenotype.

### Mechanism of syncope: Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^116Lt8wc]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

In the study population, there was a high prevalence of the hypotensive phenotype, explained by the significant proportion of patients with persistent hypotension (constitutional hypotension) and those with drug-related persistent hypotension diagnosed by ABPM. These accounted for a quarter of the patients. Such patients were usually excluded from other studies; however, our findings are more representative of the general population referred to a syncope unit as they include severe forms of autonomic syncope. This aligns with the prevailing knowledge of the hypotensive mechanism of autonomic syncope.

- **Limitations**: Some limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, the diagnosis of autonomic syncope — and the rule-out of established/suspected cardiac syncope — was made after the initial evaluation, meaning the diagnosis is most often presumptive, as typically occurs in this field. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that some patients, mistakenly assigned to the autonomic group, could have a cardiac form. Second, the order of execution of ABPM and SCAFA was decided by each participating center, and the temporal range of their execution was not reported. The initial and classical forms of orthostatic hypotension were not formally assessed in this study during SCAFA. In particular, SCAFA is unable to investigate initial orthostatic hypotension, which is only associated with active standing. As beat-to-beat BP monitoring may not be available during the initial evaluation in some centers, we cannot provide definitive conclusions regarding its impact.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet underdiagnosed disorder that may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders, ranging from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and therapeutic management (both non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For the diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking, and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright positions are necessary. OH is defined as a fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 minutes in the upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH or in patients with motor impairment.

The management initially consists of education, advice, and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second-line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

### Orthostatic hypotension: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116axeU7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent and disabling feature of autonomic failure due to both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases. Community-based epidemiological studies have demonstrated high morbidity and mortality associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It results from impairment of baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction of the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulation, caused by damage or dysfunction at central and/or peripheral sites in the baroreflex efferent pathway.

Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions may be implemented to ameliorate the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and improve quality of life. Many patients will be adequately treated by education, counseling, removal of hypotensive medications, and other nonpharmacological interventions. More severely afflicted patients require pharmacological interventions. The first stage of pharmacological treatment involves repletion of central blood volume, followed by treatment with sympathomimetic agents if repletion is unsuccessful.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115f5hXG]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal orthostatic hypotension (OH) in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps:

1. Conducting extended at-home blood pressure monitoring with results recorded by the patient or caregiver.
2. Implementing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the patient can annotate times when supine or standing. This will help determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations.
3. Use of autonomic function tests.

Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than 3 minutes of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures or prolonged tilt table testing (HUT).

The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders. Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) include autonomic reflex testing (including heart rate variability to paced breathing, heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver, and continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT). Other tests used to help diagnose nOH may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing. These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of Vraylar and was not more frequent with Vraylar than with placebo. Syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), as well as in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities) and those with cerebrovascular disease. Vraylar has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Vraylar, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, it is advisable to complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, Vraylar may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of etiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope. However, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to guide management appropriately.

A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing. Neurogenic OH (nOH), which results from autonomic dysfunction, can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope [^112wpHns]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective**: The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

- **Methods**: Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

- **Results**: This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

- **Conclusions**: OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### An increased endothelial-independent vasodilation is the hallmark of the neurally mediated syncope [^1114VePo]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is sustained by complex cardiac and vascular reflexes, amplified by central autonomic loops, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension.

- **Hypothesis**: Our aim was to assess whether the pathophysiology of NMS is also related to an abnormal peripheral vasoreactivity.

- **Methods**: We evaluated, by ultrasound, the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and the nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) in 17 patients with NMS. This was induced by a drug-free tilt test in 6 subjects and by a nitrate-potentiated tilt test in the other 11 cases. The syncope was classified as vasodepressive (VD) in 8 cases, cardioinhibitory (CI) in 7, and mixed in 2.

- **Results**: The FMD was not different from controls (10.2 ± 4.5 vs 11.4 ± 3.9, P = ns), with normal recovery times; the NMD was greater in fainting subjects than in controls (26.7 ± 7.3 vs 19.0 ± 3.6, P < 0.05). Higher values were observed in VD than in CI syncope (31.1 ± 7.0 vs 23.1 ± 5.0, P = ns). Compared to controls, subjects with NMS showed normal recovery times after FMD but longer recovery times after nitrate administration (13.0 ± 5.6 vs 6.3 ± 0.7 minutes, P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The evaluation of endothelial function supports evidence that NMS is characterized by a marked and sustained endothelial-independent vasodilation in the presence of a normal FMD. Vascular hyperreactivity in response to nitrate administration is particularly overt in vasodepressive syncope and can explain the high rate of responses to nitrate administration during the tilt test.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111uYiUy]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically in relation to the orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the preference for continuous beat-to-beat noninvasive blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measurement. This is particularly suggested when short-lived BP variations are suspected, such as in initial orthostatic hypotension.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well-informed about the diagnosis and management of nOH, as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial; for instance, patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons.

- **Consensus definition**: The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table".

In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system.

### Evaluation of syncope [^1146a5i6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with a complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e. carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication.

Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing.

In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, graded exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and additional investigations should be conducted.

### Cardiovascular risk after hospitalisation for unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117T1rME]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The study examines the long-term cumulative incidence of cardiovascular (CV) mortality rates in relation to hospital admissions due to syncope and orthostatic hypotension (OH). Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate CV mortality stratification based on incident syncope-related (blue) and OH-related (red) hospital admissions. Inpatients demonstrated a significantly lower survival rate compared to those never hospitalized for syncope or OH (green), as confirmed by a Log-rank test (p < 0.001). A black vertical line at 12 years marks the average time from baseline to first-ever OH or syncope hospital admission. Beyond this point, survival curves for OH or syncope-related hospital admissions continue to diverge from non-hospitalized patients. OH stands for orthostatic hypotension.

Risk estimation of CV death and all-cause death associated with a history of OH-related or unexplained syncope-related hospitalisation was examined during follow-up in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study cohort, involving individuals without prevalent CV disease.

### Orthostatic hypotension [^116MVUBT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a physical finding defined by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing. The condition, which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, is commonly encountered in family medicine. In healthy individuals, muscle contraction increases venous return of blood to the heart through one-way valves that prevent blood from pooling in dependent parts of the body. The autonomic nervous system responds to changes in position by constricting veins and arteries and by increasing heart rate and cardiac contractility.

When these mechanisms are faulty, or if the patient is hypovolemic, orthostatic hypotension may occur. In individuals with orthostatic hypotension, gravitational opposition to venous return causes a decrease in blood pressure and threatens cerebral ischemia. Several potential causes of orthostatic hypotension include medications; non-neurogenic causes such as impaired venous return, hypovolemia, and cardiac insufficiency; and neurogenic causes such as multisystem atrophy and diabetic neuropathy. Treatment generally is aimed at the underlying cause, and a variety of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments may relieve symptoms.

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Rexulti, can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during the initial dose titration and when the dose is increased. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus ADT in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%).

In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%). In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to patients treated with placebo included dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, and those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or on concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medication. Patients with known cardiovascular disease, such as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, should be closely observed.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^111bb6qd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It is only recently that delayed blood pressure (BP) recovery has been recognized as a cause of unexplained falls and (pre)syncope and has been associated with similar short-term and long-term risks as classic orthostatic hypotension. In the present syncope guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology and by ACC/AHA/HRS, delayed BP recovery, as a variant of orthostatic hypotension, is not mentioned. In our population, 43% of the patients with delayed BP recovery were classified as having unexplained syncope. Compared with those with classic orthostatic hypotension, patients with delayed BP recovery were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, and had a higher admission rate. Delayed BP recovery can be seen as a physical sign of subclinical impaired physiology. Therefore, we suggest that older patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a history of orthostatic (pre)syncope shortly after standing up, but with a negative oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement, be referred to a syncope unit to detect the underlying cause.

Initial orthostatic hypotension was present in eight (7%) patients in our study. This is a common (3%–10%) but unrecognized cause of syncope usually seen in younger patients. The clinical diagnosis is based on a typical history of (pre)syncope directly on standing and no classic orthostatic hypotension during oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement. The diagnosis becomes 100% certain with detection of initial orthostatic hypotension during continuous non-invasive BP measurement and recognizable symptoms. Recognition by the physician is important because management is simple and effective.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^116ETu3c]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of syncope, particularly in relation to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines advise considering a suspicion of syncope due to orthostatic hypotension. This is based on observing an asymptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline by ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, especially when the symptoms (as per history) are less consistent with orthostatic hypotension.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^115LepUL]. BMC medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC) study is a large prospective population-based study launched in the 1990s. A total of 30,446 participants were included (41% participation rate; age, 57.5 ± 7.6; women, 60.2%) and attended the baseline examination between 1991 and 1996. Details of the MDC study have been described elsewhere.

In the study, we excluded individuals with fractures that had occurred prior to hospitalisation for syncope or orthostatic hypotension (n = 39) and individuals with missing follow-up time data (n = 8), leaving 30,399 individuals included in the final analysis. Of these, 8201 subjects had incident fractures occurring after baseline examination. One of the primary outcomes was incident fractures occurring after hospital admissions for unexplained syncope or orthostatic hypotension compared with individuals without a history of such hospitalisation.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ZH7wi]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH: If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, the clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.
