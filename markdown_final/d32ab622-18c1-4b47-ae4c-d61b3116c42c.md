## Question

What is the recommended dose for cefazolin in obese patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cefazolin prophylactic dosing in obesity, including whether to use 2 g vs 3 g, how to redose, and how to reconcile conflicting guidelines and studies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the PK/PD target for surgical prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, including recent model-based analyses and systematic reviews. Next, I will examine outcome studies and guideline positions. After that, I need to consider special populations and procedure-specific nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note uncertainties and research gaps [^111UUn3B] [^112myGPK].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and PK/PD target. Cefazolin is a hydrophilic beta-lactam used for surgical prophylaxis; efficacy depends on maintaining unbound drug concentrations above MIC at the operative site for the duration of risk, typically framed as fT > MIC for 100% of the procedure time, with redosing guided by the drug's half-life and procedure length [^111UUn3B] [^115oqxAr].

> Wait, let me verify the most recent and rigorous pharmacokinetic evidence. A 2025 model-based analysis using simultaneous plasma and adipose interstitial fluid data found no clinically relevant PK differences between obese and non-obese patients and concluded that 2 g cefazolin with redosing at 4 hours achieves > 90% probability of target attainment for both groups; importantly, redosing at 3 hours offered no advantage over 4 hours, supporting a 4-hour redosing interval for longer cases [^111UUn3B] [^116NYi8E] [^115R2GkX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the broader evidence base. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses converge on the same message: the weight of evidence does not support routine escalation to 3 g for obesity, with most outcome studies showing no SSI reduction from 3 g vs 2 g and several PK studies demonstrating adequate tissue concentrations with 2 g; simulation-heavy studies are more likely to suggest underperformance of 2 g, which may reflect modeling assumptions rather than clinical reality [^112myGPK] [^111QjCbv] [^1173v72Y].

> I will now examine direct clinical outcomes. In obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery, randomized and retrospective comparative studies found no significant difference in SSI between 2 g and 3 g, despite higher plasma exposure with 3 g; similarly, a large retrospective colorectal cohort in patients ≥ 120 kg showed no SSI reduction with 3 g vs 2 g, and a matched obese vs non-obese cohort receiving 2 g showed numerically higher but non-significant SSI rates in obesity, arguing against a causal underdosing effect of 2 g [^111wQGo8] [^115fNkAH] [^116bQwpY] [^115Qpy4F].

> But wait, what if guidelines conflict with this? I should double-check guideline positions. Several specialty guidelines still recommend 3 g for patients ≥ 120 kg (e.g. ASHP/IDSA-era guidance echoed by UpToDate, ACOG for cesarean delivery, and neurosurgical/spine guidance), yet these are largely based on limited PK studies and expert opinion; in contrast, contemporary PK/PD modeling and systematic reviews increasingly support 2 g with appropriate redosing as sufficient for obesity, highlighting a guideline–evidence gap [^1176Prqf] [^117REUip] [^114WJFB4] [^112myGPK].

> Let me consider special populations and procedure-specific nuances. In pregnancy, physiologic changes and adipose distribution can lower tissue concentrations; nonetheless, randomized and PK studies in obese gravidae show adequate adipose concentrations with 2 g for most, with some simulations suggesting earlier redosing at 2 hours if closure is delayed, so I should be cautious and tailor redosing to procedure length and risk in this group [^114AHNdQ] [^111wQGo8] [^117PdAhh]. In bariatric surgery, a prospective study using 4 g achieved high tissue levels but was not powered for outcomes; given the lack of outcome benefit for 3–4 g and the availability of 2 g data, 2 g with redosing remains reasonable unless local protocols dictate otherwise [^116rri71] [^1179r377]. For cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, centers often use 2 g plus 1 g in the pump and redose every 3 hours, a regimen that achieved PK targets in patients > 120 kg, but this is center-specific and not generalizable to non-bypass procedures [^114NtU5p].

> I need to ensure I address redosing strategy clearly. Given cefazolin's half-life around 1.5–2 hours, redosing after two half-lives is standard; the most robust PK analysis supports redosing at 4 hours for procedures longer than about 4 hours or with substantial blood loss, and found no benefit to 3-hour redosing, so 4-hour redosing is preferred when indicated [^111UUn3B] [^115R2GkX] [^115oqxAr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most outcome studies show a trend toward higher SSI with 2 g in obesity", but I should verify that. The matched obese vs non-obese cohorts receiving 2 g showed numerically higher SSI rates in obesity without statistical significance, and head-to-head 2 g vs 3 g studies in obese patients have not demonstrated SSI reduction with 3 g; thus, any "trend" is non-significant and not a basis to mandate 3 g routinely [^115Qpy4F] [^115fNkAH] [^116bQwpY].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For most obese adults undergoing routine clean or clean-contaminated procedures expected to last ≤ 4 hours, 2 g cefazolin within 30–60 minutes before incision is appropriate, with redosing 2 g at 4 hours if the procedure is prolonged or blood loss is substantial; this balances efficacy, stewardship, and safety. For patients ≥ 120 kg in whom institutional policy or guideline inertia favors 3 g, using 3 g is reasonable and unlikely to cause harm, but I should acknowledge the evidence does not show improved outcomes over 2 g; conversely, in patients < 120 kg, escalation to 3 g is not supported by outcomes data and should be avoided unless a compelling local rationale exists [^111UUn3B] [^112myGPK] [^1176Prqf].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overlooking any high-credibility consensus. A 2025 expert review concludes that obesity modestly alters beta-lactam PK but does not support routine dose adjustments for cefazolin prophylaxis, aligning with the PK/PD modeling data; this reinforces a conservative, standard-dose approach with procedure-driven redosing rather than weight-based escalation [^117GZAbp].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses uncertainties and quality gaps. Many studies are small, heterogeneous, and underpowered for SSI endpoints; there are no large, multicenter RCTs comparing 2 g vs 3 g in obesity across diverse surgeries, and MIC targets vary across studies. Until such trials exist, individualized decisions should integrate patient risk, procedure type and duration, local antibiograms, and institutional policy, while defaulting to 2 g with 4-hour redosing as the evidence-based baseline for most obese adults [^112myGPK] [^1173v72Y] [^111UUn3B].

---

For obese patients, the standard cefazolin prophylaxis dose is **2 g IV within 60 minutes before incision** [^114WJFB4]. For patients weighing ≥ 120 kg, **3 g IV is recommended** to ensure adequate tissue concentrations and reduce surgical site infection risk [^1127qesN] [^114WJFB4]. Redose every 4 hours if the procedure is prolonged or blood loss exceeds 1.5 L [^116NYi8E] [^115oqxAr]. No routine adjustment is needed for obesity alone, but consider higher doses in morbid obesity or long procedures [^117GZAbp] [^115oqxAr].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in obesity

Obesity alters cefazolin pharmacokinetics by increasing the volume of distribution and altering clearance, which can lead to **subtherapeutic tissue concentrations** if standard dosing is used [^111SBBDq]. Cefazolin is hydrophilic and distributes mainly into extracellular fluid; therefore, higher body weight increases the apparent volume of distribution, potentially necessitating higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels [^1179r377].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose adjustments

Several studies have evaluated cefazolin dosing in obese patients, with **mixed findings**:

- A prospective study in morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) undergoing bariatric surgery found that a single 2 g IV dose achieved protective adipose tissue levels (> MIC of MSSA) for the duration of surgery (usually < 4 hours), suggesting no need for higher doses or intraoperative redosing [^1179r377].
- Conversely, other studies have demonstrated that higher doses (3 g) result in significantly higher plasma and tissue concentrations, particularly in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg, supporting the use of increased doses in this population [^111wQGo8] [^112Vx731].
- A randomized controlled trial in obese women undergoing cesarean delivery found no significant difference in adipose tissue concentrations between 2 g and 3 g doses, suggesting that 2 g may be sufficient in this specific population [^114AHNdQ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from major organizations provide **specific recommendations** for cefazolin dosing in obese patients:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) | - 2 g IV for patients weighing > 80 kg <br/> - 3 g IV for patients weighing > 120 kg [^111y2r9E] |
| Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) | - 2 g IV for patients weighing < 120 kg <br/> - 3 g IV for patients weighing ≥ 120 kg [^111xtPu8] |
| Surgical Infection Society (SIS) | Consider higher dosages at the upper end of treatment ranges for obese patients [^117Esg2n] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with dosing strategies

Clinical outcomes with different dosing strategies have been studied, with **no consistent superiority** of higher doses in reducing surgical site infections (SSI):

- A retrospective cohort study in morbidly obese pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery found no significant difference in SSI rates between 2 g and 3 g cefazolin doses [^115fNkAH].
- Similarly, a multicenter retrospective cohort study in obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery found no significant difference in SSI incidence between 2 g and 3 g cefazolin doses [^116bQwpY].
- However, some studies have reported trends toward higher SSI rates in obese patients receiving standard doses, suggesting that higher doses may be beneficial in certain populations [^113JxCjy].

---

## Safety considerations

Cefazolin is generally well tolerated, and **higher doses (up to 3 g) have not been associated with significant increases in adverse events** in obese patients. However, clinicians should remain vigilant for potential allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and rare hematologic abnormalities.

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **practical recommendations** are suggested:

- **Standard dose**: 2 g IV within 60 minutes before incision for most obese patients [^112myGPK] [^115oqxAr].
- **Increased dose**: 3 g IV for patients weighing ≥ 120 kg or with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² [^114Qe5Vr] [^112Vx731].
- **Redosing**: Every 4 hours for prolonged procedures (> 4 hours) or significant blood loss (> 1.5 L) [^116NYi8E] [^115oqxAr].
- **Individualized dosing**: Consider patient-specific factors such as renal function, surgical procedure, and infection risk [^114kAPj8] [^1173v72Y].

---

## Conclusion and future research directions

Current evidence suggests that **standard 2 g dosing is sufficient for most obese patients**, with dose escalation to 3 g recommended for those weighing ≥ 120 kg or with severe obesity. However, conflicting data and variability in pharmacokinetic studies underscore the need for further research, including large-scale randomized controlled trials, to definitively establish optimal dosing strategies in this population [^111DF7EQ].

Conclusion

Despite consistent findings that cefazolin tissue concentrations are inversely correlated with BMI of the patient, the bulk of evidence supports the notion that there is no need for higher doses of cefazolin for SSI prophylaxis in patients with obesity for surgical procedures lasting up to 4 h. All outcome studies and nine out of fifteen pharmacokinetic studies included in this review (including all three RCTs) reported this conclusion. If studies relying on simulation techniques are discounted, only three out of fourteen recommend a dose increase. Factors such as type of tissue sampled and type of surgical procedure did not appear to influence the success of using a 2-g dose of cefazolin. Although large-scale outcome-based RCTs are needed in the area, current evidence does not support higher than 2-g prophylactic cefazolin doses in surgical patients with obesity.

Conclusion

While no statistically significant difference in SSI prevalence was observed in non-obese and obese patients, or those who weighed above and below 120 kg, who received a 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose, trends toward an increase were evident. There is a clear need for large-scale randomised controlled trials to examine whether a 2-g or 3-g cefazolin dose is adequate to prevent SSI in obese individuals.

Introduction

Globally, more than 600 million people are living with obesity, and this number is continuing to rise. Obesity increases the likelihood of developing diabetes, coronary heart disease and many other chronic illnesses, and individuals with obesity are more likely to require surgical procedures at earlier stages of life. Furthermore, patients with obesity who undergo surgery are at greater risk of developing intra- and post-surgical complications, such as venous thromboembolism, delayed wound healing and surgical site infection (SSI). SSI can be of particular concern, as it reduces survival rates, increases disease-related morbidity, increases duration of hospital stay and increases the likelihood of hospital re-admissions. Combined, these factors result in significant costs to the healthcare system. To minimise the risk of SSI, it is standard procedure to administer intravenous prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery from clean-contaminated surgery and beyond.

Patients with obesity have significant physiological changes such as altered renal function and body volume and composition, which in turn can alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of many drugs. This can potentially reduce the efficacy of a standard dose for non-obese individuals. As such, dose adjustments are often warranted in this patient population. Cefazolin, a hydrophilic beta-lactam antibiotic, is widely used in SSI prophylaxis. A standard dose of cefazolin is 2 g given as an intravenous bolus within 15–60 min prior to surgery. Studies have aimed to determine whether this dose is efficacious in patients with obesity, or whether practice guidelines should be updated to include a higher recommended dose for this group of patients. These studies fall into two broad categories: clinical outcome studies and pharmacokinetic studies. Outcome studies assess the incidence of SSI, usually 30 days following surgery, aiming to ascertain whether a standard 2-g dose of cefazolin was sufficient in preventing SSI in patients with obesity. Pharmacokinetic studies measure the cefazolin concentrations in plasma and/or body tissues before and during surgery. These drug tissue concentrations are compared with a pre-determined target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to assess adequacy of dosing.

Although many clinical and experimental studies have been conducted to examine whether patients with obesity need higher cefazolin dosing, no systematic review has combined both outcome and pharmacokinetic studies to draw a rigorous conclusion. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to gather and critically evaluate the current data surrounding prophylactic cefazolin dosing in patients with obesity, informing evidence-based clinical practice.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^111QjCbv]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus on whether a standard 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose provides sufficient antimicrobial coverage in obese surgical patients. This systematic review analysed both outcome and pharmacokinetic studies, aiming to determine the appropriate cefazolin dose. A systematic search was conducted using 4 databases. In total, 3 outcome and 15 pharmacokinetic studies met the inclusion criteria. All 3 outcome studies concluded that there is no need for increased dose. Also, 9 pharmacokinetic studies reached this conclusion; however, 6 pharmacokinetic studies recommended that 2-g dose is insufficient to achieve adequate plasma or tissue concentrations. The stronger body of evidence supports that 2-g dose of cefazolin is sufficient for surgery lasting up to 4 h; however, large-scale outcome studies are needed to confirm this evidence.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^115Qpy4F]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Most surgical prophylaxis guidelines recommend a 3-g cefazolin intravenous dose in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg. However, this recommendation is primarily based on pharmacokinetic studies rather than robust clinical evidence. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of surgical site infections (SSIs) in obese and non-obese patients (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 and < 30 kg/m 2), and those weighing ≥ 120 kg and < 120 kg, who received 2- g cefazolin preoperatively.

Methods

A retrospective case-control study was conducted in adult elective surgical patients. Patients receiving 2- g cefazolin were grouped as obese and non-obese, and by weight (≥ 120 kg or < 120 kg). The 90-day prevalence of SSI and potential contributing factors were investigated.

Results

We identified 152 obese (median 134 kg) and 152 non-obese control (median 73 kg) patients. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for an increased prevalence in the obese group of diabetes (35.5% vs 13.2%; p < 0.001) and an American Society of Anaesthesiologists Score of 3 (61.8% vs 17.1%; p < 0.001). While not statistically significant, the prevalence of SSI in the obese group was almost double that in the non-obese group (8.6% vs 4.6%; p = 0.25) and in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg (n = 102) compared to those weighing < 120 kg (n = 202) (9.8% vs 5.0%; p = 0.17).

Conclusion

The prevalence of SSI was not significantly increased in obese patients, or those weighing ≥ 120 kg, who received cefazolin 2- g prophylactically; however, trends toward an increase were evident. Large-scale randomised trials are needed to examine whether a 2-g or 3-g cefazolin is adequate to prevent SSI in obese (and ≥ 120 kg) individuals.

Discussion

Cefazolin is the most widely used drug for SSI prophylaxis. Although it has a wide therapeutic window, the use of unnecessarily high doses increases costs, increases selection pressure on mutations for resistance and could increase the risk of C. difficile infection. Conversely, under-dosing increases the risk of infection and resistance. Current guidelines on prophylactic cefazolin dosing for patients with obesity do not give consistent recommendations. For instance, the British National Formulary recommends 1 g given before surgery followed up with another 0.5–1 g after 2 h, without any adjustment for body weight. In contrast, the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines recommend 2 g in adults, and 3-g dose "is reasonable" in patients weighing more than 120 kg, citing studies that draw mixed conclusions, including some that do not recommend a change in dosage. Resources such as those published by UpToDate mimic American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guidelines recommending 3-g cefazolin dose if the patient weighs more than 120 kg. This recommendation is based on few studies, with only one that directly investigated cefazolin dosing in patients with obesity.

Although most studies included in this review assessed pharmacokinetic data, prevention of infection is the primary goal of the prophylactic dosing strategy, and outcome studies provide the real-world outcome data. Two outcome studies concluded that above 2-g dose is neither required nor efficacious. A third study found non-statistically significantly higher SSI rates in the obese cohort compared to the non-obese cohort, who all received 2 g. Overall, outcome studies do not support prophylactic doses higher than 2 g cefazolin in surgical patients with obesity.

Drawing conclusions from pharmacokinetic studies is more complex than from outcome studies, as a greater number of variables are assessed in these studies. Forms of heterogeneity between studies, such as type of surgery, cefazolin doses given, participant characteristics, MIC targets adopted, sampling methods and the simulation approaches, result in increased complexity. Grouping studies by such categories may help discern whether any of these factors predicted a particular conclusion.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^114uGaRy]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Most surgical prophylaxis guidelines recommend a 3-g cefazolin intravenous dose in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg. However, this recommendation is primarily based on pharmacokinetic studies rather than robust clinical evidence. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of surgical site infections (SSIs) in obese and non-obese patients (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 and < 30 kg/m 2), and those weighing ≥ 120 kg and < 120 kg, who received 2- g cefazolin preoperatively.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^115PZskJ]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The dose of prophylactic antibiotic is an important factor in SSI prevention, and pharmacokinetic studies provide baseline information about dose and timing. However, pharmacokinetic findings may not always be translated into clinical outcomes. Our findings showed no statistically significant difference in SSI prevalence between obese and non-obese patients, or those who weighed above and below 120 kg, who received a 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose preoperatively. However, there were approximately twofold increases in SSI prevalence in obese compared to non-obese patients and in those who weighed ≥ 120 kg compared to those who weighed < 120 kg. The lack of statistically significant differences could be due to our relatively small sample size.

To date, no outcome study has shown the superiority of using a dose of prophylactic cefazolin exceeding 2- g in obese surgical patients. A retrospective outcome study was conducted of obese (mean BMI = 35 kg/m 2; n = 99) and non-obese (mean BMI = 27 kg/m 2; n = 96) patients across various surgical specialties, who received a 2-g cefazolin prophylactic dose. No significant difference in 30-day SSI prevalence was noted between the obese and non-obese groups (7.0% vs 5.2%, p = 0.56). Likewise, a recent retrospective study of 2- g (mean BMI = 36 kg/m 2; n = 152) or 3- g (mean BMI = 40 kg/m 2; n = 284) prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obese patients of various surgical specialties reported a very similar 90-day SSI prevalence in the two dosing groups (7.2% vs 7.4%, p = 0.95). Our obese cohort had a higher median BMI (47 kg/m 2) compared to patients in the aforementioned studies (35 kg/m 2 and 36 kg/m 2) who received a 2-g cefazolin dose. This is a possible explanation for the larger difference in SSI prevalence in the obese patients versus control patients in our study compared to the previous studies.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^111hXMSa]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A final important consideration in assessment of conclusions is quality of included studies. All three randomised control studies included in this review concluded that there is no need for higher dose or re-dosing of cefazolin in patients with obesity. Cohort studies included in this review reported mixed findings: half of these studies concluded that 2 g of cefazolin was sufficient and half concluded the need for an increased dose in patients with obesity. Case series studies also reported an even split in their conclusions. Finally, all case control studies (i.e. outcome studies) – concluded that 2-g cefazolin dose is sufficient to provide adequate SSI prophylaxis in patients who are obese. However, there is no outcome-based RCT; findings of these outcome studies should be considered with caution.

There are a few important limitations of this review. Firstly, there was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies, such as in study design, sampling techniques, sampling tissue, MIC cutoff values and study populations. Such variation can make it difficult to directly compare studies. Secondly, outcome studies comparing the broad family of general surgery between normal BMI with obese and morbidly obese do not compare procedures for the same diagnosis and the same approach which cause a real bias. Thirdly, due to this heterogeneity, meta-analysis could not be conducted, leaving us with a mostly qualitative analysis. Fourthly, although outcome studies were assessed, only three such studies matching selection criteria were found, again potentially reducing the generalisability of this review to real-world clinical settings. Fifthly, as there were no large-scale registry studies included in this review, sample sizes were relatively small. Finally, the surgery duration for the majority of studies included in this systematic review was less than 4 h. Therefore, the findings of this review will need to be carefully applied to prolonged surgeries of more than 4-h duration.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^111xtPu8]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obese patients undergo surgical procedures more frequently than their non-obese counterparts due to obesity-related health problems, such as osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Obesity is also associated with a number of surgical complications, including an increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI). The repercussions of SSI include extended hospital stay, more frequent hospital readmissions, pain, anxiety and higher healthcare resource utilisation. However, the administration of an appropriate antibiotic at an appropriate dose before surgery significantly reduces the risk of SSI.

Cefazolin remains the drug of choice for surgical prophylaxis in many procedures due to its favourable safety profile, low cost and targeted activity against the microorganisms commonly encountered during surgical procedures. In 2013, a collective guideline for surgical prophylaxis developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), suggested an increased dose of cefazolin (3- g intravenously) for patients weighing ≥ 120 kg. Similarly, the Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH) recommends a 3-g dose of cefazolin for patients > 120 kg. The American Journal of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin and the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines (TG) also suggest the need for a higher prophylactic cefazolin dose for obese surgical patients but do not specify the recommended dose or weight or BMI cut-off values.

The dosing recommendations of those guidelines were based on small-scale and inconsistent pharmacokinetic studies (level-III according to the National Health and Medical Research Council levels of evidence). Four pharmacokinetic studies found that a 2-g prophylactic dose of cefazolin may be inadequate in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric procedures and caesarean section, due to the blood and/or tissue drug concentrations being below minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). These studies suggested the need for a higher (3- g) dose in these patients. In contrast, six pharmacokinetic studies in similar surgical specialties found that a 2-g dose did provide adequate antimicrobial coverage (concentration above MIC) in morbidly obese patients with similar weight ranges, suggesting no dose increment was required.

Given the lack of satisfactory evidence supporting 3- g dosing in obese patients and a scarcity of clinical outcome studies, this study sought to ascertain whether an intravenous 2- g dose of cefazolin was comparatively effective in obese versus non-obese surgical patients, and in those who weighed above or below 120 kg, based on the observed rate of SSI within 90 days of operation.

Results

Study Selection

The PRISMA flow diagram is presented in Fig. 1. In total, 1182 results were identified, of which, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria and five additional articles were identified from cross-reference search. In total, 18 articles were included in this systematic review and all 18 met the pre-defined cutoff criteria (> 60% of checklist items) for quality assessment. The major reasons for exclusion of articles after full text were the following: antibiotics other than cefazolin were given, additional doses of cefazolin were administered post-surgery or cefazolin dosage given was based on patient weight, meaning that impacts of dose or patient weight could not be isolated from one another.

Fig. 1
PRISMA diagram outlining study selection process

Selected articles were categorised into outcome studies or pharmacokinetic studies (Fig. 2). Outcome studies were further subdivided into (a) dosing comparator (2 g vs 3 g) and (b) non-obese comparator (obese vs non-obese). Pharmacokinetic studies were sub-divided into (a) dosing comparator (2 g, 3 g or 4 g), (b) obese comparator (obese vs morbidly obese vs super morbidly obese) and (c) studies that only had one group and drew conclusions based on the pre-defined pharmacokinetic parameter ranges, or through techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations. Two studies combined approaches (a) and (b).

Methods

Information Sources and Search Strategy

CINAHL, Medline, PubMed and Scopus electronic journal databases, since date of inception, were accessed and searched during April 2021. The search included the following key words: cefazolin, obese (or obesity or overweight), surgery (or surgical or elective or procedure) and prophylaxis (or prophylactic or dose). This review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Appendix 1) and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021276409).

Article Selection and Review

After removal of duplicates, article titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer (Author 1). Following this, a full-text review was conducted by Author 1 and checked by Author 4. Author 2 was consulted in case of conflicts.

Inclusion Criteria

Human studies in which patients underwent elective surgical procedure and received cefazolin as the sole prophylactic antibiotic agent were included. Studies were also required to have at least one group of patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2). Studies which investigated the adequacy of the prophylactic cefazolin dose in terms of either rate of surgical site infection (SSI) or cefazolin plasma/tissue concentrations were retained. These studies reported BMI and cefazolin dose and one or more of the following: rates of SSI post-surgery, cefazolin tissue/plasma concentrations, MIC, protective duration, elimination half-life (t 1/2) and area under the curve (AUC). Studies in which patients received antibiotics other than cefazolin, or studies in which patients received additional antibiotics for treatment of infection (not for prophylaxis), were excluded.

Quality Assessment

To evaluate quality of evidence, articles which met the inclusion criteria were assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tools. This process was adopted to determine the possibility of biases or inadequacies in study design, data collection and analysis by assigning a score to each article based on a multi-item checklist. The quality assessment was conducted by two independent reviewers (MC and ZH). Disagreements between these two reviewers were to be settled by a third reviewer (AS). Studies that satisfied the criteria for greater than 60% of the checklist items were included in the systematic review (Appendix 2–4).

Studies of a Single Cohort with Obesity

Four studies which were conducted on a single group each are summarised in Table 4. One of these studies found that all 37 patients in their cohort (≥ 35 kg/m 2) had adipose tissue concentrations above a MIC of 1 mcg/g, with a mean adipose tissue concentration of 8.8 mcg/g (SD = 5.1). A study with a sample of 20 patients, with BMI 38–79 kg/m 2, showed that serum levels of cefazolin remained above a MIC of 1 mcg/mL for up to 4 h after dosing in all patients, and that rate of cefazolin clearance was not correlated with weight (p = 0.42). The other two studies used modelling techniques to predict the impact of different doses in a single patient group. The first study found that two of their twelve participants did not reach target MIC plasma concentrations of 2 mcg/mL when given 2 g of cefazolin. This study predicted (using simulations) that > 95% of patients who weigh 90–150 kg would have concentrations above this MIC if 2 g cefazolin was re-dosed at 2 h. Furthermore, > 99% of patients would reach targets if patients were instead treated with 3-g doses initially and again at 2 h. A final study administered 4-g cefazolin dose to patients with BMI > 40 kg/m 2. It was found that this dose was sufficient to maintain a MIC of 4 mcg/mL for up to 3 h, but was not sufficient for 4 h. The Monte Carlo simulation method used in this study showed that 2-g and 3-g doses were not likely to achieve a MIC for more than 2 h, and only a 3-g bolus plus 1-g infusion was sufficient in staying above the MIC for 4 or more hours.

Outcome Studies

Dosing Comparator Studies

All outcome studies used the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention definition of SSI. Two of the three outcome studies investigated the efficacy of doses above 2 g cefazolin for SSI prevention. Both retrospective studies assessed large cohorts (N = 335 and N = 436, respectively) and compared cefazolin 2 g with 3 g (Table 1). The first study found the SSI occurrence in post-caesarian patients with obesity was 13.1% in both groups, regardless of dose. The second found SSI rates of 7.2% with 2 g and 7.4% with 3 g dosing (p = 0.95) in patients who underwent various elective procedures. Perhaps notably, there was a mean BMI difference of 3–4 kg/m 2 between control and intervention groups in both studies (Table 1).

Table 1

Weight-Based Comparator Studies

The only weight-based comparator study included in this review evaluated the efficacy of 2-g cefazolin in cohorts with (N = 152) and without obesity (N = 152) (Table 1). This study found higher SSI rates in the cohort with obesity compared to the non-obese cohort, although this difference was not statistically significant (8.6% vs 4.6%; p = 0.25).

Pharmacokinetic Studies

All pharmacokinetic studies compared measured cefazolin concentration with a pre-determined MIC target value. As MIC values for a given antimicrobial depend on which microbes it is being tested against, there was some variability between studies for MIC targets. Timing of tissue sampling and type of tissue used for sampling (for example, samples taken from interstitial fluid versus those taken from adipose tissue) also varied between studies, potentially affecting drug tissue concentrations and expected targets.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^115qbEer]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The need for more than 2 g doses of cefazolin in obese patients for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been studied and debated with differing results. We evaluated the adequacy of clinically relevant cefazolin dosing regimens for surgical prophylaxis based on exposure in plasma and ISF of adipose tissue, the usual site of infection. Using f T > MIC = 100% as a target, we did not find any clinically relevant influence of obesity. A second dose after 4 h was sufficient in the context of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with an administration of 2 g.

The data presented in this study were previously published and analysed using noncompartmental analysis (NCA). The NLME approach of this study confirmed the NCA results revealing no clinically relevant differences in cefazolin concentrations between obese and nonobese patients. Based on the evaluated scenarios, our results agree with the majority of PK and outcome studies conducted, to investigate the need for a higher cefazolin dose in obese patients, concluding it is not needed. Based on these results, the higher incidence of SSIs observed in obese patients does not appear related to inadequate cefazolin dosing regimens. The large range in patient BMI (18.7–69.3 kg m −2) included in this study allowed us to characterise PK differences between obese and nonobese patients based on differences in body composition. However, these PK differences were not considered to be clinically relevant in terms of dosing regimen adequacy. However, because a higher incidence of SSIs and lower plasma and ISF concentrations are observed in obese patients early after dosing, whether time-related targets are not the best efficacy measure must be considered and could be explored in future studies.

Although this analysis agrees with previous findings, it further suggests that doses lower than 2 g could be sufficient. However, practically, because the MIC cannot be established in a prophylactic setting, 2 g remains the recommended dose for obese and nonobese patients. Nonetheless, in a local setting when the MIC distribution is known, the same alternative doses might be considered for both obese and nonobese patients. One modelling and simulation study that concluded that obese patients require a dose adaptation did not include a control group (nonobese) and the majority of samples were collected only up to 2.5 h after dosing, whereas the other two included only pregnant women as obese populationor included a low number of patients (n = 15). These differences from the present study design and study population might explain the different conclusions obtained.

Editor's key points

- Perioperative dosing recommendations for cefazolin, used as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections, are currently inconsistent for obese patients.
- Pharmacokinetic data for cefazolin from plasma and interstitial space fluid (ISF) of adipose tissue obtained by microdialysis for obese and nonobese surgical patients receiving prophylactic cefazolin were analysed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.
- In the context of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, administration of 2 g cefazolin i.v. with redosing at 4 h was the most suitable dosing regimen for both obese and nonobese patients such that no dose adjustment is necessary.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) pose a significant risk to patient safety. However, the incidence of SSIs can be reduced by use of appropriate perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of SSI is higher in obese than in nonobese patients. Obesity is associated with atypical anthropometric values and pathophysiological alterations that can influence drug pharmacokinetics. These alterations include changes in body composition, tissue distribution, and renal and hepatic drug elimination. Consequently, standard dosing regimens of antibiotics might not provide optimal drug exposure in obese patients, potentially compromising the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, highlighting the need for identifying optimal prophylactic dosing regimens for obese patients.

Results

One hundred and fifty-two obese patients met the inclusion criteria for this study and were matched with non-obese controls (Fig. 1). Patient characteristics are described in Table 1. There were differences between the obese and non-obese groups in median body weight (133.5 kg vs 72.5 kg, p < 0.001), median BMI (47.0 kg/m 2 vs 26.7 kg/m 2, p < 0.001), presence of diabetes (35.5% vs 13.2%, p < 0.001) and ASA score (score 3 in 61.8% vs 17.1%, p < 0.001). Overall, nearly two thirds (64.5%) were general surgical patients and more than half had a clean surgical wound in each group (non-obese = 58.6% and obese = 61.8%). Less than 2% of patients in either group were given prophylactic antibiotics when it was not recommended according to the Australian TG.

Thirteen (8.6%) obese and 7 (4.6%) non-obese patients developed SSIs (p = 0.25; Table 2). Similarly, the observed rate of SSI was 9.8% in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg (n = 102) compared to 5.0% in those weighing < 120 kg (n = 202) (p = 0.17). Three patients (2 obese and 1 non-obese) developed a SSI during their admissions and 17 (11 obese and 6 non-obese) developed SSI post-discharge. Four of the SSIs were classified as deep (2 obese and 2 non-obese) and 16 as superficial (11 obese and 5 non-obese).

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^1173v72Y]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Out of six pharmacokinetic studies which concluded that 2-g dose was insufficient in individuals with obesity, three used Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Conversely, of the nine pharmacokinetic studies concluding that 2 g is sufficient, only one used Monte Carlo simulations. As such, use of simulation techniques appears to be predictive of the conclusion that a 2-g dose is insufficient. As with all statistical or probabilistic-based conclusions, accurate Monte Carlo simulations have two prerequisites: (1) an unbiased sample and (2) a sufficient sample size. If there is bias in the sample on which the simulations are based, this will be reflected and perhaps amplified in the simulated outcome. Also, if the sample size is insufficient, one has less power to draw conclusions on the biassed nature of the simulation. This caveat is paradoxical, as Monte Carlo simulations are used as a way of 'expanding' sample sizes to predict outcomes. Of the four studies using simulated patients, three had an actual patient sample size of 15 or less. This may represent a significant weakness in these study designs. A limitation of the Monte Carlo study which based its simulations on a larger sample (N = 117) is that it included only high (4 g) doses of cefazolin given to real patients, perhaps representing a significant source of bias. In summary, although a higher proportion of simulation studies concluded that the dose of cefazolin should be increased in patients with obesity, these study designs carry inherent limitations.

The principles of antibiotic prophylaxis remain the same between different surgical procedures, and multiple guidelines recommend the same doses of cefazolin across many types of surgery. However, several factors, such as wound type, invasive nature of the surgery (laparoscopic surgery vs open surgery) and type of tissue being operated on, can alter the risk of SSI. Eight studies included in this review were conducted on caesarian delivery patients. seven on bariatric surgery patients and three on patients undergoing mixed elective surgical procedures such as orthopaedic, gynaecological and trauma-related. Three of the bariatric (laparoscopic) surgery studies and three of the caesarian delivery studies concluded that 2 g of cefazolin was insufficient, indicating that neither surgery type appears to predict an increased need for greater doses of cefazolin over the other. Hence, it can be concluded that type of surgery does not appear to warrant a need to alter the cefazolin dose.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^115sYv5Y]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cefazolin is commonly used for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis owing to its activity against pathogens frequently encountered in SSIs, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Some studies have investigated the need for perioperative prophylactic cefazolin dosing adjustments for obese patients, but the results are contradictory. Although the majority of evidence supports standard dosing for cefazolin (2 g, short-term i.v. infusion), three out of four studies that applied modelling and simulation frameworks concluded the opposite. In addition, a second antibiotic dose is recommended after twice its half-life, which would be 3–4 h after the first dose in the case of cefazolin, but this recommendation has not been investigated conclusively.

For cefazolin, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target has been set to unbound drug concentration in plasma above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 100% of the operation time. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, it is also essential to measure drug concentrations at the site of potential infection (interstitial space fluid [ISF] of soft tissue), as drug exposure in plasma might not reflect exposure in the ISF. Unbound drug concentrations from the ISF can be obtained by microdialysis, a minimally invasive sampling technique to obtain target-site concentrations. Pharmacometric models, which allow simultaneous integration and analysis of data from different sources (e.g. measurements from plasma and ISF), can be used to simulate concentration–time profiles to investigate the influence of obesity on the probability of achieving a specific PK/PD target.

We aimed to evaluate the adequacy of clinically relevant cefazolin dosing regimens (i.e. dose and dosing intervals) for obese patients for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and to derive dosing recommendations by application of modelling and simulation techniques. We leveraged published PK data from obese and nonobese patients, integrating observed cefazolin concentrations in both plasma and ISF.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^114oEkbX]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Appropriate prophylactic antibiotic administration is just one measure of the multifactorial approach used in the prevention of SSI. Therefore, stringent inclusion criteria on patient selection were applied so that the effect of cefazolin dosing could be independently estimated. We excluded patients with factors that can potentially alter the pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics (such as non-infective unplanned post-operative admissions due to acute illness) or affect the wound healing process (such as peri-operative blood transfusion and taking immunosuppressive medications). Furthermore, non-modifiable risk factors, such as older age, smoking, diabetes, LOS, duration of surgery, pre-existing implanted medical devices and wound class, were considered in the statistical analyses.

Patients with diabetes, an ASA score of 3, longer surgery duration and longer LOS tended to have higher SSI occurrence in our study. These are well-established known risk factors for SSI development. Other SSI risk factors reported in the literature, such as smoking, advanced age and non-clean surgical wounds in obese patients, did not show a significant association with SSI.

This study has some limitations. Firstly, it was not a prospective randomised controlled trial. The retrospective study design meant we had to rely on the notes available in patients' medical records. For instance, we were not able to record the exact timing of prophylactic cefazolin dose administration. However, from the anaesthetic chart reviews, we could ascertain that the doses were always administered in theatre, anywhere from immediately before induction until shortly after incision. As mentioned, the sample size of the study was relatively small. One possible reason for the small number of patients identified in our case group is that obesity was coded sporadically in hospital records as a comorbidity (ICD-10 list). Also, we excluded patients who underwent vascular, urologic, cardiothoracic and reconstructive surgery due to their limited numbers, which might compromise the generalisability of findings to these surgical specialities.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^1138vknh]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The most evident factor for potential variation between patients is the weight categories included. Studies that solely examined different doses between groups had wide mean BMI ranges (38.9–49.7 kg/m 2) and reported inconsistent findings. For instance, the study that included groups of patients from the heaviest weight ranges (BMI 40–49 kg/m 2 as the lowest weight group and BMI 50–59 kg/m 2 and > 60 kg/m 2 groups) concluded that higher doses are needed for patients with obesity, but another that included patients with a BMI range of 38–79 kg/m 2 2, 33 concluded that 2 g is sufficient.

Another potential reason for varied findings is that different studies used different MIC values (1 to 32 mcg/mL). Two studies chose MIC targets > 8 mcg/mL (or > 8 mcg/g), with one concluding that 2 g of cefazolin is sufficient and the other concluding that 2 g is not sufficient. Studies at the other end of the spectrum which used a defined MIC value of 1 mcg/mL to cover staphylococcal species in gastric bypass surgeries found that 2 g of cefazolin was sufficient. Studies between these two extremes, which selected MIC targets of 2–8 mcg/mL (or 2–8 mcg/g in adipose tissue), had mixed conclusions with five concluding that 2 g is not sufficient and six concluding that a 2-g dose is sufficient.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^116i8US4]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A study comparing 2 g of cefazolin given via IV push with (a) 2 g of cefazolin given via a 30-min infusion and (b) 3 g of cefazolin given via a 30-min infusion found that each of these doses resulted in plasma concentrations above the pre-specified MIC of 8 mcg/mL for more than 4 h. Mean cefazolin plasma concentrations ranged from 22.9 mcg/mL in the 2-g IV push group with BMI 40–50 kg/m 2 to 40.8 mcg/mL in the 3-g infusion group in patients with BMI > 50 kg/m 2. They also concluded that the method of administration did not affect the cefazolin elimination half-life. Another study which combined experimental and computational methods measured the difference between 2-g and 3-g doses in plasma and subcutaneous tissue concentrations and used this data to run Monte Carlo simulations. This study showed that 2-g cefazolin dose provided plasma and tissue concentrations above the pre-specified MIC of 2 mcg/mL for up to 4 h in 89% of patients, whilst 3 g kept concentrations above MIC for up to 5 h. It was concluded that a 2-g dose was sufficient for procedures lasting up to 4 h.

Conversely, a study comparing a 3-g cefazolin dose with a historic cohort which received 2 g found that the higher dose provided a greater chance of reaching MIC targets. This study reported that only 20% of the cohort with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m 2 and none of the patients with a BMI of > 40 kg/m 2 reached a plasma MIC of 8 mcg/mL with 2-g cefazolin dosing. All patients in the BMI 30–40 kg/m 2 group and 71% in the > 40 kg/m 2 group reached target concentrations with a 3-g cefazolin dose.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^115R2GkX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

For perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, it is typically recommended to redose after twice the half-life of the antibiotic. However, because the reported half-life for cefazolin ranges between 1.5 and 2 h, redosing at 3 and 4 h was evaluated in this study. No benefits of redosing after 3 h were observed compared with redosing at 4 h at a dose of 2 g. Therefore, for practical reasons, redosing is recommended 4 h after the first cefazolin administration for longer surgical procedures.

We acknowledge that the sample size of patients included in the study (n = 30) is a limitation. However, it has to be considered a large sample when compared with other microdialysis studies. Because systemic and target-site exposure might differ, being able to perform such evaluations at the probable site of infection is of great value.

Saturable binding of cefazolin was observed and quantified, consistent with previous studies. However, albumin is considered the main binding partner for cefazolin, and its concentration is much higher than the maximum binding capacity estimated in this study. Nevertheless, the nonlinear binding behaviour has been observed consistently, suggesting that the binding mechanisms remain unclear.

No impact of participant or clinical characteristics was included for cefazolin clearance. As cefazolin is mostly eliminated renally, an impact of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on clearance could be expected. All eGFR calculation methods point towards increased renal function for obese individuals; however, obesity is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Therefore, identification of eGFR to explain expected clearance differences between obese and nonobese patients might be nontrivial. To overcome this, in future studies, measurements of GFR should be performed. Lastly, although use of PK/PD targets is well established to link drug exposure to efficacy, data on clinically measured outcome endpoints should, in the future, be collected, at least in observational settings.

In conclusion, with the evaluated condition, this study showed that in the context of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin, no dose adjustment is necessary in obese patients. In general, initial administration of 2 g cefazolin i.v. with redosing at 4 h intraoperatively is sufficient.

### Increased 3-gram cefazolin dosing for cesarean delivery prophylaxis in obese women [^1127qesN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine tissue concentrations of cefazolin after the administration of a 3-g prophylactic dose for cesarean delivery in obese women (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m(2)) and to compare these data with data for historic control subjects who received 2-g doses. Acceptable coverage was defined as the ability to reach the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 μg/mL for cefazolin.

Study Design

We conducted a 2-phase investigation. The current phase is a prospective cohort study of the effects of obesity on tissue concentrations after prophylactic 3-g cefazolin doses at the time of cesarean delivery. Concentration data after 3-g were compared with data for historic control subjects who had received 2-g. Three grams of parenteral cefazolin was given 30–60 minutes before skin incision. Adipose samples were collected at both skin incision and closure. Cefazolin concentrations were determined with the use of a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay.

Results

Twenty-eight obese women were enrolled in the current study; 29 women were enrolled in the historic cohort. BMI had a proportionally inverse relationship on antibiotic concentrations. An increase of the cefazolin dose dampened this effect and improved the probability of reaching the recommended MIC of ≥ 8 μg/mL. Subjects with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m(2) had a median concentration of 6.5 μg/g (interquartile range [IQR], 4.18–7.18) after receiving 2-g vs 22.4 μg/g (IQR, 20.29–34.36) after receiving 3-g. Women with a BMI of > 40 kg/m(2) had a median concentration of 4.7 μg/g (IQR, 3.11–4.97) and 9.6 μg/g (IQR, 7.62–15.82) after receiving 2- and 3-g, respectively. With 2 g of cefazolin, only 20% of the cohort with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m(2) and none of the cohort with a BMI of > 40 kg/m(2) reached an MIC of ≥ 8 μg/mL. With 3-g, all women with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m(2) reached target MIC values; 71% of the women with a BMI of > 40 kg/m(2) attained this cutoff.

Conclusion

Higher adipose concentrations of cefazolin were observed after the administration of an increased prophylactic dose. This concentration-based pharmacology study supports the use of 3 g of cefazolin at the time of cesarean delivery in obese women. Normal and overweight women (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) reach adequate cefazolin concentrations with the standard 2-g dosing.

### Cefazolin prophylaxis for total joint arthroplasty: obese patients are frequently underdosed and at increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^112kDBTG]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

One of the most effective prophylactic strategies against periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is administration of perioperative antibiotics. Many orthopedic surgeons are unaware of the weight-based dosing protocol for cefazolin. This study aimed at elucidating what proportion of patients receiving cefazolin prophylaxis are underdosed and whether this increases the risk of PJI.

Methods

A retrospective study of 17,393 primary total joint arthroplasties receiving cefazolin as perioperative prophylaxis from 2005 to 2017 was performed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups (underdosed and adequately dosed) based on patient weight and antibiotic dosage. Patients who developed PJI within 1 year following index procedure were identified. A bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to control for potential confounders and identify risk factors for PJI.

Results

The majority of patients weighing greater than 120 kg (95.9%, 944/984) were underdosed. Underdosed patients had a higher rate of PJI at 1 year compared with adequately dosed patients (1.51% vs 0.86%, P = .002). Patients weighing greater than 120 kg had higher 1-year PJI rate than patients weighing less than 120 kg (3.25% vs 0.83%, P < .001). Patients who were underdosed (odds ratio, 1.665; p = 0.006) with greater comorbidities (odds ratio, 1.259; P < .001) were more likely to develop PJI at 1 year.

Conclusion

Cefazolin underdosing is common, especially for patients weighing more than 120 kg. Our study reports that underdosed patients were more likely to develop PJI. Orthopedic surgeons should pay attention to the weight-based dosing of antibiotics in the perioperative period to avoid increasing risk of PJI.

Weight-Based Comparator Studies

The five pharmacokinetic studies which used weight-based comparators are summarised in Table 3. Out of these studies using the standard 2-g cefazolin, one measured cefazolin concentration in adipose tissue. This study found that samples from 20% of patients with BMI 30–40 kg/m 2 and 44% of patients with BMI > 40 kg/m 2 did not meet a MIC of 4 mcg/g at closure. Significant differences in mean cefazolin concentrations between BMI categories were found at time of incision (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001), but not at time of closure (p = 0.36 and p = 0.07).

### Dosing of antibiotics in obesity [^111ymh38]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity is becoming a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The management of infections is problematic due to both an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as a lack of information about dosing of antibiotics in the obese population. Recommendations in this patient group are severely lacking, so clinicians need to consider pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and the relative risks of overdosing and underdosing.

Recent Findings

Since 2011, articles on a number of antibiotics have been published, including cefazolin/cephazolin, cefepime, cefoxitin, clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, daptomycin, ertapenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.

Summary

Obesity causes a number of changes, including an increase in volume of distribution and changes in hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Several antibiotics have sufficient data to be able to make recommendations, whereas other antibiotics may need to make use of doses at the upper end of the recommended range, or utilize other dose modifications based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in an attempt to reach adequate levels and achieve similar efficacy.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^111UUn3B]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cefazolin is used as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs). Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for SSIs. Cefazolin dosing recommendations and guidelines are currently inconsistent for obese patients. As plasma and target-site exposure might differ, pharmacokinetic data from the sites of SSIs are essential to evaluate treatment efficacy: these data can be obtained via tissue microdialysis. This analysis was designed to evaluate the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical prophylaxis.

Methods

Data from 15 obese (BMI median = 52.6 kg m -2) and 15 age- and sex-matched nonobese patients (BMI median = 26.0 kg m -2) who received 2 g cefazolin i.v. infusion for infection prophylaxis were included in the analysis. Pharmacokinetic data from plasma and interstitial space fluid (ISF) of adipose tissue were obtained and analysed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Dosing regimens were evaluated by calculating the probability of target attainment (PTA) and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for plasma and ISF using unbound cefazolin concentration above minimum inhibitory concentration 100% of the time as target (fT > MIC = 100%). Dosing regimens were considered adequate when PTA and CFR were ≥ 90%.

Evaluation of cefazolin doses of 1 and 2 g with redosing at either 3 or 4 h by PTA and CFR in plasma and ISF found 2 g cefazolin with redosing at 4 h to be the most suitable dosing regimen for both obese and nonobese patients (PTA > 90% and CFR > 90% for both).

Conclusions

This model-based analysis, using fT > MIC = 100% as a target, showed that cefazolin dosing adaptations are not required for surgical prophylaxis in obese patients.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^1133Jg2T]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

A list of obese patients, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10), who underwent elective surgical procedures during 2012 to 2016, was obtained from the hospital's coding database. The list was then reviewed to identify patients who met the inclusion criteria. To include non-obese control patients, a list of similar elective surgical procedures from 2012 to 2016 was systematically screened, by including every fifth patient if they met the study inclusion criteria, until we reached approximately equal numbers in every surgical speciality to that of obese group.

Patients' medical records were reviewed to obtain socio-demographic and clinical information, including gender, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes status, length of stay (LOS), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score, surgical wound class, duration of surgery, post-operative antibiotic use, surgical specialty and SSI incidence. Diabetes was identified based on a recorded diagnosis or use of any medication for diabetes management at admission or discharge. Wound class was categorised based on the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) criteria. Duration of surgery was calculated as the time between skin incision and skin closure. LOS was calculated from date of admission until date of discharge in patients who did not develop SSI during admission or until date of SSI development for those who developed SSI during admission. Surgical procedures were grouped into a surgical specialty based on the department in which the patient underwent surgery, i.e.g.eneral surgery (such as laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, incisional hernia repair), gynaecological surgery (such as caesarean section, hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy) and orthopaedic surgery (such as hip and knee replacement, hip arthroplasty, ankle fracture). Prophylactic pre-operative cefazolin dose and post-operative antibiotic use (when not for SSI treatment) were recorded. Inpatient, outpatient and emergency department notes were screened for up to 90 days post-operatively to identify documented SSIs, which were classified into superficial, deep and organ/space, in accordance with the CDC.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^114yKQVz]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Four studies measured interstitial fluid and plasma concentrations. The first of these found that all patients given 2 g cefazolin before surgery attained a maternal plasma MIC of 17 mcg/mL for the duration of the procedure. A second study compared the plasma concentrations in patients who had BMI < 40 kg/m 2 and BMI > 40 kg/m 2 after administration of 3 g (2 g bolus plus 1 g slow infusion). Plasma cefazolin concentrations were 5.3–13.8 mcg/mL in the BMI < 40 kg/m 2 group and 4.7–8.64 mcg/mL in the BMI > 40 kg/m 2 group (p = 0.006), all above a MIC of 4 mcg/mL.

A study which used a combination of experimental methods and Monte Carlo simulations to compare patients with BMI < 30 kg/m 2 to patients with BMI > 40 kg/m 2 2, 30 showed that the probability of maintaining an interstitial fluid MIC of 4 mcg/mL after 4 h with a 2-g cefazolin dose was 66.3% in the morbidly obese group compared with 94.9% in the non-obese group. For a MIC of 2 mcg/mL, this probability was 95.6% and 99.7% in the respective groups. The authors concluded that higher doses are needed in patients with morbid obesity. Another study that only assessed patients with BMI > 40 kg/m 2 found that patients who were given 2 g cefazolin prior to surgery and re-dosed during surgery had 73% chance of exceeding a MIC of 32 mcg/mL in the BMI 40–49 kg/m 2 group, with this probability dropping to 52% in the BMI > 60 kg/m 2 group.

### Cefepime dosing in the morbidly obese patient population [^112pLJDN]. Obesity Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Proper dosing of specific antibiotics in morbidly obese patients has been studied inadequately. However, these data are beneficial as this patient population is at an increased risk to develop postoperative infections. Cefepime is an antibiotic used for the treatment of both gram-positive and especially gram-negative infections; administration of the appropriate dose in the morbidly obese population is crucial. We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in patients with body mass index > 40 kg/m(2). Ten morbidly obese patients, with a mean [± SD] estimated glomerular filtration rate of 108.4 ± 34.6 mL/min, undergoing elective weight loss surgical procedures were administered cefepime in addition to standard prophylactic cefazolin and studied. Serial serum cefepime concentrations were analyzed after dosing using a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Pharmacokinetics and duration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined using a protein binding value of 15% and a MIC threshold of 8 μg/mL. Mean free cefepime concentrations for t = 30, 120, and 360 min were 69.6, 31.6, and 9.2 μg/mL, respectively. The dosing interval was calculated to maintain the free concentration above the MIC (fT > MIC) for 60% of the interval. This was determined to be 10.12 h, including time for infusion. There was no toxicity. Based on this analysis, an increased dose of 2 g every 8 h is necessary to maintain an adequate fT > MIC throughout the dosing interval. Further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of this regimen in the settings of active infections and critical illness.

### Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis dosing in adult patients with obesity: a comprehensive review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data [^113Gv4yE]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an important measure to prevent postoperative surgical site infections. Current guideline recommendations do not treat obesity specifically, although it can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The objective of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the need for obesity-related dosing adjustments in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating antibiotic prophylaxis dosing in surgical patients with obesity. Outcomes of interest were pharmacokinetic parameters such as plasma and interstitial fluid concentrations, area under the concentration time curve in plasma and in interstitial fluid, and other pharmacokinetic measures. Thirty studies investigating cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, ertapenem, metronidazole, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were included in this analysis. Except for metronidazole, cefoxitin, and gentamicin, there is currently no evidence suggesting the need for dosing adjustments.

Obesity and β-lactam infusion strategies — summary and research needs: Based on population PK studies and simulations, PI may overcome some of the effects of body weight on β-lactam concentrations, and for gastric bypass prophylaxis, use of CI with larger cefazolin doses (> 2 g) may help ensure adequate tissue concentrations; however, no studies demonstrate the superiority of PI versus SI β-lactam dosing in obese patients regarding clinical outcomes. The authors note that the use of PIs may be a reliable approach to improve fT > MIC and ensure adequate serum concentrations in obese patients, but larger-than-standard doses are often also needed.

### Antibiotic therapy of pneumonia in the obese patient: dosing and delivery [^116v99tV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial therapy in obese patients for different infections, including pneumonia, represents a clinical challenge because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, this area is understudied and underappreciated. A recent large cohort study of adult patients with septic shock, including patients with pneumonia, showed that the total daily administered doses of commonly used antibiotics did not differ among the different body mass index (BMI) groups. This translated to lower dose per kg in the obese and very obese patients compared with the normal BMI patients even after adjustment for creatinine clearance. Another retrospective study at an emergency department (ED) found that the adherence rates to hospital guidelines for the first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin in patients with weights more than 100 kg and BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 were only 8.0, 3.0, and 1.2%, respectively. Additionally, obesity has been associated with antibiotic underdosing and treatment failure. A cohort study of mostly outpatients receiving oral antibiotics for different reasons including lower respiratory tract infection found that obesity was a significant predictor of antibiotic treatment failure, defined as any additional antibiotic prescriptions or hospitalizations for infections within 30 days after initial therapy [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–1.52].

In this review, we will highlight the recent studies of commonly used antibiotics in obese patients with community or healthcare-associated pneumonia. We focus on the dosing regimens rather on antibiotic selection, which is beyond the scope of this review. Of note is that most studies have evaluated plasma drug levels as the main endpoint and only a few evaluated lung tissue levels. The association of different dosing regimens with clinical endpoints, such as pneumonia recovery, recurrence, and mortality, are seriously understudied.

### Cefazolin prophylaxis in obese women undergoing cesarean delivery: a randomized controlled trial [^114AHNdQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare adipose tissue concentration among obese women receiving 2 g compared with 3 g of precesarean cefazolin prophylaxis.

Methods

This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial of women with singleton gestations and body mass indexes (BMIs) of 30 or greater at their first prenatal visit undergoing cesarean delivery at term. Women were randomly allocated, stratified by BMI, to receive 2 g or 3 g of cefazolin. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was harvested twice: before (opening) fascial incision and after (closing) fascial closure. The primary outcome was opening adipose tissue cefazolin concentration, measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

Results

From April 2013 to July 2014, 58 women were enrolled, 57 included in the analysis: 28 in the 2-g group and 29 in the 3-g group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Median opening adipose tissue concentration was similar between the 2-g and 3-g groups (9.4 [interquartile range 5.1–13.4] compared with 11.7 [interquartile range 7–18.3] micrograms/g, P = .12). The percentage of women with opening concentrations above 8 micrograms/g, the minimally inhibitory concentration of cefazolin for Staphylococcus species, was similar (61% compared with 72%, P = .35). All samples were above 2 micrograms/g, the minimally inhibitory concentration for Enterobacteriaceae. Closing adipose tissue concentrations and stratified analyses were consistent with the overall analysis.

Conclusion

In obese women undergoing cesarean delivery, prophylaxis with 3 g of cefazolin did not significantly increase adipose tissue concentration. Thus, our data do not support recommendations for 3-g dosing.

Bariatric surgery prophylaxis with cefazolin — continuous infusion and dose strategies in morbid obesity: Standard single-infusion (SI) cefazolin 2 g at incision may fail to provide adequate tissue concentrations in obese patients, and after a bolus 2 g induction dose followed by continuous infusion (CI) 1 g, patients with a normal BMI had higher adipose-tissue cefazolin concentrations than those with BMI ≥ 40kg/m2; in 89 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses, surgical site infection rates were 4.16%, 1.98%, and 1.55% (p > 0.05) for two 3 g ampicillin/sulbactam doses, a single 1 g ertapenem dose, or 2 g cefazolin at induction plus CI cefazolin 1 g throughout the procedure, respectively; a population PK study of 117 morbidly obese patients (mean BMI 46.95 kg/m2) treated with 4 g cefazolin before gastrectomy found that a 3 g loading dose followed by CI 1 g/h achieved 90% PTA for MIC 4 mg/L until 4 h after loading, and concluded that in some bariatric surgeries an initial 4 g dose was sufficient, but for extended surgeries, CI should be considered.

### Obesity and skin and soft tissue infections: how to optimize antimicrobial usage for prevention and treatment? [^1173LbCh]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are prevalent in the obese population, with rising trend expected. Although numerous antibiotics are available for the prevention and treatment of SSTIs, their characterization in obese patients is not a regulatory mandate. Consequently, information that carries importance for optimizing the dosing regimen in the obese population may not be readily available. This review focuses on the most recent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on this topic with attention to cefazolin for surgical prophylaxis as well as antibiotics that are active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, the implications for optimizing SSTIs prevention and treatment in the obese population will also be discussed.

Recent Findings

On the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations, most studies found a perioperative prophylactic cefazolin regimen of 2g to be reasonable in the case of obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery or bariatric surgery. There is general paucity of data regarding the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of antimicrobials active against MRSA in obese patients, especially for the target tissue. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been correlated with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization for vancomycin and teicoplanin, and should be used in these cases. There is more supportive evidence for the use of oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid), daptomycin and lipoglycopeptides (telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin) in the management of SSTIs in this population.

Summary

The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach, which can be used as a basis or supplement to clinical trials, provides valuable data and decision-making tools for optimizing regimens used for both prevention and treatment of SSTIs in the obese population. Important pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibiotics, such as the penetration into the subcutaneous tissue and the probability of reaching the pharmacodynamic, target dictate efficacy, and thus should be taken into account and further investigated.

### Underdosing of common antibiotics for obese patients in the ED [^115gweC9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a growing problem in the United States. Obesity alters the pharmacokinetic profiles of various drugs. Although there are guidelines for dose adjustments for many of the antibiotics commonly used in the emergency department (ED), they are seldom used.

Methods

This is an institutional review board-approved retrospective study at an American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence and a level I trauma center with annual ED volumes of more than 80,000 visits. Data were retrospectively collected from ED pharmacy records during a 3-month period in 2008. Any first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, or ciprofloxacin administered in our ED to a patient recorded as both more than 100 kg and with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m(2) was compared with our hospital guidelines and found to either adhere or not adhere to those guidelines.

Results

There were 1910 orders found to meet the study criteria: 775 orders for cefepime, 625 orders for cefazolin, and 510 orders for ciprofloxacin. Adherence rates for first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin administered, respectively, were 8.0%, 3.0%, and 1.2%.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians frequently underdose cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin in obese patients. Underdosing antimicrobials presents risk of treatment failure and may promote antimicrobial resistance. Education is necessary to improve early antibiotic administration to obese patients.

Coloured lines represent the median; shaded areas are 5th–95th percentiles; and the dashed black line represents MIC = 4 mg L −1. ISF, interstitial space fluid; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration.

Fig 3
Probability of target attainment (≥ 90%) of unbound cefazolin in (a–d) plasma and (e–h) interstitial space fluid for four different dosing regimens: (a, e) 1 g with redosing after 3 h, (b, f) 1 g with redosing after 4 h, (c, g) 2 g with redosing after 3 h, and (d, h) 2 g with redosing after 4 h. Bars represent MIC distribution of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. ISF, interstitial space fluid; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; PTA, probability of target attainment.

Similar to PTA analysis, CFR analysis did not show different results between nonobese, obese, and morbidly obese reference patients (Fig. 4). All evaluated dosing regimens reached CFR ≥ 90% for all three reference patients in both plasma and ISF.

Fig 4
Cumulative fraction of response (≥ 90%) of unbound cefazolin in (a–d) plasma and (e–h) interstitial space fluid for different dosing regimens: (a, e) 1 g with redosing after 3 h, (b, f) 1 g with redosing after 4 h (c, g) 2 g with redosing after 3 h and (d, h) 2 g with redosing after 4 h in nonobese, obese, and morbidly obese reference patients. CFR, cumulative fraction of response; ISF, interstitial space fluid.

No differences in PTA and CFR results between nonobese and obese patients were observed under any of the evaluated scenarios. Based on the performed PTA and CFR analyses, 2 g (redosing 2 g at 4 h) appeared as the most suitable dosing regimen when MIC is unknown or MIC = 4 mg L −1. However, in the case of known MIC ≤ 2 mg L −1, 1 g (redosing 1 g at 4 h) was also found to be an adequate dosing regimen. Ultimately, no benefit of redosing at 3 h compared with 4 h was observed under any of the evaluated dosing regimen scenarios for all three reference patients.

Antimicrobial dosage adjustments in obese patients — For aminoglycosides, base dosage on adjusted body weight (ideal body weight plus 40% of the excess weight above ideal weight). For β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and for cephalosporins, use dosages at the higher end of treatment ranges, or use standard dosages with therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill obese patients. For fluoroquinolones, use dosages at the higher end of treatment ranges, or base dosage on adjusted body weight (ideal body weight plus 45% of the excess over ideal body weight). For clindamycin, use higher dosages up to 4.8 g/d in patients with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2. For vancomycin, base dosage on actual body weight, with limitation of the total dose to 4 g/d. For linezolid, dosage adjustment for obesity is not currently recommended. For daptomycin, base dosage on total body weight.

### Cefazolin tissue concentrations with a prophylactic dose administered before sleeve gastrectomy in obese patients: a single centre study in 116 patients [^116rri71]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, the blood and fatty-tissue concentrations of cefazolin required for adequate antibiotic prophylaxis are uncertain.

Methods

This was a single centre prospective study in obese (Group A: 40 ≤ BMI ≤ 50 kg m -2) and severely obese (Group B: 50 < BMI ≤ 65 kg m -2) patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Blood and fatty-tissue samples were collected after a cefazolin 4 g i.v. injection. The primary aim was to compare cefazolin concentrations in subcutaneous fatty tissue with a targeted tissue concentration of 4 μg g -1 according to Staphylococcus aureus resistance breakpoint.

Results

One hundred and sixteen patients were included: 79 in Group A and 37 in Group B. At the beginning of the surgery, cefazolin concentration in subcutaneous fatty tissue was 12.2 (5.4) μg g -1 in Group A and 12 (6.1) μg g -1 in Group B (P = 0.7). At the end, cefazolin concentrations in subcutaneous fatty tissue were 9.0 (4.9) and 7.8 (4.2) μg g -1 in Groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.2). The plasma concentration of free cefazolin during surgery was higher in Group A than in Group B (P < 0.0001). Fatty-tissue concentrations of 95% and 83% patients in Groups A and B, respectively, were above S. aureus resistance breakpoint.

Conclusions

After a 4 g dose, the concentrations of cefazolin in fatty tissue were above the 4 μg g -1 tissue concentration target, providing adequate antibiotic tissue concentrations during bariatric surgery. As cefazolin concentration in fatty tissue is a surrogate endpoint, the results should be considered in conjunction with the results on free cefazolin concentrations in subcutaneous tissue.

### Incidence of surgical infection in cefazolin 3 g versus 2 g for colorectal surgery in obese patients [^116bQwpY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) between cefazolin 3 g and 2 g surgical prophylaxis in patients weighing ≥ 120 kg that undergo elective colorectal surgery.

Methods

A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was performed utilizing a validated database of elective colorectal surgeries in Michigan acute care hospitals. Adults weighing ≥ 120 kg who received cefazolin and metronidazole for surgical prophylaxis between 7/2012 and 6/2021 were included. The primary outcome was SSI, which was defined as an infection diagnosed within 30 days following the principal operative procedure. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with SSI; the exposure of interest was cefazolin 3 g surgical prophylaxis.

Results

A total of 581 patients were included; of these, 367 (63.1%) received cefazolin 3 g, while 214 (36.8%) received 2 g. Patients who received cefazolin 3 g had less optimal antibiotic timing (324 [88.3%] vs 200 [93.5%]; p = 0.043) and a higher receipt of at least 1 of the prophylaxis antibiotics after incision (22 [6%] vs 5 [2.3%]; p = 0.043). There was no SSI difference between cefazolin 3 g and 2 g cohorts (23 [6.3%] vs 16 [7.5%], P = .574). When accounting for age, smoking status, and surgical duration, cefazolin 3 g was not associated with a reduction in SSI (adjOR, .64; 95%CI, .32–1.29).

Conclusions

Surgical prophylaxis with cefazolin 3 g, in combination with metronidazole, was not associated with decreased SSI compared to 2 g dosing in obese patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^1152vqHU]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society revised IAI guidelines — antimicrobial dosing in adult patients: Use standard dosages for lower-risk patients who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 1-B). Consider use of higher dosages in selected higher-risk patients (Grade 2-B). Use adjusted dosages based on outcome data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where applicable, in patients with significant renal impairment (Grade 2-B), and use adjusted dosages of selected, hepatically eliminated or metabolized agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). Consider use of adjusted dosages based on outcome data and pharmacokinetic parameters in obese patients (Grade 2-B). Do not use prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents routinely in all patients, but consider these approaches as options in critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

### Pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in patients with obesity undergoing surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass [^114NtU5p]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors' objective was to determine the adequacy of an institutional standard dosing practice for infection prophylaxis in open cardiac surgery in patients heavier than 120 kg undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

Design

A prospective, single-center, open-label study was used to determine if cefazolin serum concentrations were maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) throughout surgery. A pharmacokinetic model describing cefazolin disposition was developed for perioperative patients with morbid obesity, based on these values. Probability of target attainment was evaluated across the clinically relevant MIC spectrum.

Setting

Maine Medical Center is an academic hospital in Portland, Maine, affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine.

Participants

Twenty patients scheduled for cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass who weighed at least 120 kg.

Interventions

All patients received 2 g of cefazolin intravenously (IV) within 1 hour before incision, an additional 1 g injected into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit at the initiation of bypass, and 2 g administered IV every 3 hours after the initial IV dose.

Measurements and Main Results

Cefazolin serum concentrations were collected after incision, after initiation of bypass, each hour of bypass, at the end of bypass, and at sternal closure. For patients weighing > 120 kg undergoing cardiac surgery, the studied dosing regimen met or exceeded targeted cefazolin concentrations for all study patients. The authors conducted probability of target attainment analyses using both 65% and 100% of time with unbound drug concentrations across clinically relevant MICs.

Conclusion

The authors found that their current dosing strategy achieved a probability of target attainment > 90% throughout surgery for both total and unbound cefazolin concentrations, independent of cardiopulmonary bypass times.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in bariatric surgery with continuous infusion of cefazolin: determination of concentration in adipose tissue [^113wUkAy]. Obesity Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of cefazolin in adipose tissue of patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Methods

Eighteen patients undergoing bariatric surgery were evaluated during the period from October 2011 to May 2012. All patients had a dosage schedule of antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin administered as follows: first, 2 g in anesthetic induction, followed by continuous infusion of 1 g diluted in 250 mL of saline solution. Adipose samples, collected soon after the incision (initial) and before the skin synthesis (final), were analyzed using reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The level of significance adopted was 5%.

Results

The cefazolin concentration in the adipose tissue samples at the beginning of surgery was an average of 6.66 ± 2.56 ug/ml. The mean concentration before the skin synthesis was 7.93 ± 2.54 ug/ml. Patients with BMI < 40 kg/m(2) had higher initial and final sample concentrations of cefazolin than patients with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2). There was no surgical site infection (SSI) in any of the patients.

Conclusions

In bariatric surgeries, addition of a 1 g increase of cefazolin, administered through continuous intravenous infusion, to the currently recommended dose of 2 g administered in anesthetic induction provided a concentration in the adipose tissue above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the main causal agents of SSI. An inverse correlation between BMI and concentration of cefazolin in adipose tissue was observed.

### Pediatric obesity: pharmacokinetics and implications for drug dosing [^114GSn1U]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinicians are increasingly likely to have under their care obese children with diseases requiring pharmacotherapy. Optimal drug dosing for this population is unclear. Excess weight likely leads to alterations in pharmacokinetics. The purpose of this article was to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in overweight and obese children and, where possible, provide recommendations for drug dosing.

Methods

EMBASE (1980-May 2015), MEDLINE (1950-May 2015), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2015) databases were searched by using the following terms: obesity, morbid obesity, overweight, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug, dose, drug levels, pediatric, and child. The search was limited to English-language articles. References of relevant articles were searched to identify additional studies.

Findings

Total body weight (TBW) is an appropriate size descriptor for dosing antineoplastic agents, succinylcholine, and cefazolin. Obese children seem to require less heparin, enoxaparin, and warfarin per kilogram TBW than normal-weight children; providing standard adult doses may be insufficient, however. Obese children may also require less vancomycin and aminoglycosides per kilogram TBW than normal-weight children. For these medications, an alternate size descriptor in children has not been described, and initial dosing based on TBW and monitoring serum concentrations (vancomycin and aminoglycosides) or coagulation parameters (heparin, enoxaparin, and warfarin) is warranted. Obese children require less propofol than normal-weight children; however, there is limited information about the dosing of other anesthetics or opioids.

Implications

Limitations to the available data include the inherent design constraints to case reports and retrospective cohort studies, as well as the small numbers of children in some of the studies. Use of normal-weight historical control subjects for obese children in the context of a pharmacokinetic study is not ideal. Although more information is becoming available, our understanding of the pharmacokinetics in obese children is still limited. When dosing information is not available for obese children, it may be necessary to extrapolate from available data in obese adults, but one should consider the effects of the child's age on pharmacokinetics.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^115oqxAr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

There is no evidence that prolonging PAP after surgery can reduce the risk of SSIs. A single preoperative dose is adequate for the majority of procedures. Post-procedural doses of intravenous antibiotics (up to 24 h) may be only required in defined circumstances, such as some cardiac and vascular surgeries.

Below, seven practices for a correct surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are illustrated:
Antibiotics alone are unable to prevent SSIs. Strategies to prevent SSIs should always include attention to the following: IPC strategies including correct and compliant hand hygiene practices Meticulous surgical techniques and minimization of tissue trauma Hospital and operating room environments Instrument sterilization processes Perioperative optimization of patient risk factors Perioperative temperature, fluid, and oxygenation management Targeted glycemic control Appropriate management of surgical wounds
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative SSI, or when foreign materials are implanted.
Antibiotics given as prophylaxis should be effective against the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens most likely to contaminate the surgical site, i.e. Gram-positive skin commensals or normal flora colonizing the incised mucosae.
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics beginning within 30–60 min before the surgical incision is recommended for most antibiotics (e.g. cefazolin), to ensure adequate serum and tissue concentrations during the period of potential contamination. Obese patients ≥ 120 kg require higher doses of antibiotics.
A single dose is generally sufficient. Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic) or with associated significant blood loss (> 1.5 L).
There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
Each institution is encouraged to develop guidelines for the proper surgical prophylaxis.

### Optimal cefazolin prophylactic dosing for bariatric surgery: No need for higher doses or intraoperative redosing [^1179r377]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this pharmacokinetic (PK) study was to evaluate whether a single 2-g prophylactic dose of cefazolin given (IV) bolus provides effective protective cefazolin levels for prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), the primary skin pathogen in bariatric surgery.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-seven patients having gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy received cefazolin 2-g preoperative prophylaxis. Serum, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and deep peri-gastric adipose tissue specimens were collected at incision and before skin closure. Cefazolin concentrations in serum and adipose tissue were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Results

Penetration of cefazolin, a water soluble antibiotic, into adipose tissue was only 6–8% of simultaneous serum levels. However, cefazolin tissue concentrations in all adipose tissue specimens, exceeded mean MIC for MSSA.

Conclusions

Prophylactic cefazolin, given as a single 2 g (IV bolus 3–5 min before skin incision) was more than adequate in providing protective cefazolin levels for the duration of bariatric surgery. Cefazolin 2 g (IV dose bolus given just before skin incision) achieves protective adipose tissue levels (> MIC of MSSA) for the duration (usually < 4 h) of bariatric surgical procedures. In this study, cefazolin 2 g (IV bolus) provided protective adipose tissue levels for 4.8 h. Since cefazolin is a water soluble antibiotic (V d = 0.2 L/Kg), penetration into adipose tissue is not V d not dose-dependent. Extremely high-dosed cefazolin, i.e., 3 or 4 g is excessive and unnecessary for bariatric surgery prophylaxis. A single cefazolin 2 g preoperative dose also eliminates the need for intraoperative redosing at 4 h.

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

The incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after bariatric surgery is approximately 0.1–0.5% and, in the vast majority of cases, occurs after the patient is discharged. A multimodal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis via chemoprophylaxis, mechanical aids, and/or patient mobilization is suggested. It is reported as a key item in ERABS. Chemoprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) after surgery and home discharge is considered effective and is associated with a lower bleeding risk. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific dose and duration of the LMWH treatment. Early ambulation in the postoperative period is considered a useful component of multimodal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

Antibiotic prophylaxis

The incidence of surgical site infections in obese patients varies from 1 to 21.7%, depending on the procedure type. The use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is then recommended. It should follow the standard guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The most frequently used antibiotic is cefazolin (dosage 1–4 g), with clindamycin recommended as an alternative in allergic patients. A dose adjustment based on the patient's weight compared to a fixed dose of 2 g administered intravenously before surgical incision is preferable. Higher dosages (cefazolin 3 g) in patients weighing > 120 kg should be considered. Literature does not support prophylactic vancomycin or cefoxitin. Intestinal preparation by antibiotic prophylaxis (whether or not combined with mechanical preparation) is not recommended in bariatric surgery. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia or 30–60 min before surgical incision, is reported to be one of the important items in ERABS.

Monitoring

The standard for anesthesia monitoring should be ensured in the perioperative period. In obese patients, anesthesia depth monitoring ensures a more accurate induction of anesthesia with propofol and reduces the risk of awareness from inadequate dosing, as well as during intravenous and inhalational anesthesia. The monitoring of the neuromuscular function helps reduce the risk of postoperative respiratory complications. Temperature monitoring reduces the risk of hypothermia, improving postoperative recovery.

Standardized anesthesia approach

The standardized ERABS approach showed favorable outcomes compared to a non-standardized one. Advances in the perioperative care of obese patients translated into a standardized anesthesiological approach have been proven to be effective and safe in the ERABS context as well.

Spine instrumentation

Question: what type and duration of perioperative antibiotics should be used for spinal surgery?

Recommendation

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered to decrease infection rates. Antibiotics should be redosed intraoperatively if spinal implants are being used but prolonged antibiotics are not required for high-risk patients or for spinal instrumentation. Cefazolin is often sufficient but high-risk patients may benefit from gram-negative coverage and/or application of intrawound vancomycin or gentamicin sponges.

Discussion

The North American Spine Society (NASS) recommends, based on several randomized and retrospective studies, a single dose of preoperative antibiotics to decrease infection rates for patients undergoing spine surgery without implants. Although several studies based largely on elective spinal surgery literature support a single dose of perioperative antibiotics, a prolonged postoperative course of antibiotics has not been shown to further decrease the rate of SSI and may even be associated with higher odds of CDI and prolonged hospital length of stay. Intraoperative redosing of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis has also been associated with a reduction in SSI in a broad range of surgical procedures, but no studies have directly compared intraoperative dosing versus no redosing for spinal surgery. The NASS, the Spine Intervention Society (SIS), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) all recommend redosing antibiotics if the duration of the procedure exceeds two half-lives of the drug or in the setting of excessive blood loss. Therefore, we recommend a preoperative dose of antibiotics with intraoperative redosing as needed for non-instrumented spine surgery.

Patients requiring instrumented fusions tend to have a higher rate of infection compared with those who do not receive spinal implants, and infection rates may be even higher in trauma patients, particularly those with spinal cord injuries. Therefore, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in instrumented spinal surgery in patients with or without cord injury is recommended. Meta-analysis of relevant trials has not identified an improved risk of SSI with the use of extended postoperative prophylaxis compared with preoperative prophylaxis alone. Therefore, a prolonged course of postoperative antibiotics does not appear to provide additional benefit over a preoperative dose (with intraoperative redosing to maintain therapeutic levels for prolonged procedures) for reducing postoperative infection rates. This holds true for high-risk patients as well. Patients with diabetes, obesity, age > 60 years old, active smokers, and previous surgical infection history are at high risk of SSI, but there is no proven benefit to a prolonged course of antibiotics in this high-risk population.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in women with body mass index > 35 kg. M-2 undergoing cesarean delivery: a pharmacokinetic study of plasma and interstitial fluid [^117PdAhh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a risk factor for surgical site infection after cesarean delivery. There is inadequate pharmacokinetic data available regarding prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obese pregnant women. We aimed to describe the plasma and interstitial fluid (ISF) pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in obese women undergoing elective cesarean delivery and use dosing simulations to predict optimal dosing regimens.

Methods

Eligible women were scheduled for elective cesarean delivery at term, with a body mass index (BMI) of > 35 kg·m. Plasma and ISF samples were collected following 2 g of intravenous cefazolin. Concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo dosing simulations were performed using Pmetrics. Total and unbound cefazolin concentrations in plasma and ISF were compared with the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90) of cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus, 2 mg·L. The fractional target attainment (FTA) of dosing regimens to achieve a pre-established target of 95% unbound ISF concentrations > 2 mg·L throughout a 3-hour duration of the surgery was calculated.

Results

The 12 women recruited had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) BMI of 41.5 (39.7–46.6) kg·m and a median (IQR) gestation of 38.7 weeks (37.9–39.0). For each timepoint up to 180 minutes, the median across subjects of total and unbound plasma concentration of cefazolin remained above 2 mg·L. The minimum observed total plasma concentration was 31.7 mg·L and plasma unbound concentration was 7.7 mg·L (observed in the same participant). For each timepoint up to 150 minutes, the median across subjects of unbound ISF concentrations remained above 2 mg·L. The minimum observed unbound ISF concentration was 0.7 mg·L (observed in 1 participant). In 2 participants, the ISF concentration of cefazolin was not maintained above 2 mg·L. The mean (± standard error [SE]) penetration of cefazolin (calculated as area under the concentration-time curve for the unbound fraction of drug [fAUC]tissue/fAUCplasma) into the ISF was 0.884 ± 1.11. Simulations demonstrated that FTA > 95% was achieved in patients weighing 90–150 kg by an initial 2 g dose with redosing of 2 g at 2 hours. FTA was improved to > 99% when an initial 3 g dose was repeated at 2 hours.

Conclusions

To maintain adequate ISF antibiotic concentrations in obese pregnant women, our results suggest that redosing of cefazolin may be required. When wound closure has not occurred within 2 hours, redosing is suggested, following either a 2 or 3 g initial bolus. These preliminary results require validation in a larger population.

Obesity and β-lactam prolonged infusion — recommendation and dosing evidence: Based on available evidence, we suggest the use of PI to improve efficacy compared with SI dosing in obese patients. Evidence includes an extended-infusion piperacillin–tazobactam population PK/PD study in 27 patients (16 obese, 11 nonobese) receiving 4.5 g or 6.75 g every 8 h over 4 h, where clearance and volume of distribution differed between obese and nonobese; at MICs ≥ 16 mg/L, doses needed to meet PTA > 90% were at least 3.375 g every 8 h over 4 h in nonobese and at least 4.5 g every 8 h over 4 h in obese, leading to a recommended empiric regimen of 4.5 g every 8 h infused over 4 h (with no outcome data for this dose), and separate work found obese patients were more likely to experience piperacillin underdosing.

Surgical site infections — risk factors and antibiotic prophylaxis for complex spine surgery. Risk factors for surgical site infection include prolonged preoperative hospitalization, diabetes, elevated serum glucose (≥ 125 mg/dL preoperatively or ≥ 200 mg/dL postoperatively), smoking, alcohol abuse, previous surgical site infection, and obesity. Specific procedure-related risk factors include surgery duration > 2 to 5 hours, blood loss > 1 L, staged procedures, multilevel fusions, screw/plate placement, and combined anterior-posterior fusion. General considerations include optimal timing of administration for different antibiotics (eg, vancomycin infusion should be started as early as 120 min before the surgical incision). Intravenous antibiotics should be administered within 60 minutes before surgical incision, followed by appropriate redosing during surgery (Class I, Level of Evidence A). The recommended antibiotic regimen is cefazolin (2 or 3 g for those > 120 kg) or an equivalent first-generation cephalosporin; if there is evidence that gram-negative organisms are the cause of surgical site infection, consider combining clindamycin or vancomycin with another agent, for example, cefazolin for those not beta-lactam allergic or aztreonam/gentamicin/single-dose fluoroquinolone for those beta-lactam allergic (Class I, Level of Evidence A).

### Effects of maternal obesity on tissue concentrations of prophylactic cefazolin during cesarean delivery [^11273wrA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the adequacy of antimicrobial activity of preoperative antibiotics at the time of cesarean delivery as a function of maternal obesity.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients scheduled for cesarean delivery were stratified according to body mass index (BMI) category, with 10 study participants classified as lean (BMI less than 30), 10 as obese (BMI 30–39.9), and nine as extremely obese (BMI 40 or higher). All patients were given a dose of 2 g cefazolin 30–60 minutes before skin incision. Antibiotic concentrations from adipose samples, collected after skin incision and before skin closure, along with myometrial and serum samples, were analyzed with microbiological agar diffusion assay.

Results

Cefazolin concentrations within adipose tissue obtained at skin incision were inversely proportional to maternal BMI (r = -0.67, P < .001). The mean adipose concentration was 9.4 plus or minus 2.7 micrograms/g in the lean group of women compared with 6.4 plus or minus 2.3 micrograms/g in the obese group (P = .009) and 4.4 plus or minus 1.2 micrograms/g in the extremely obese group (P < .001). Although all specimens demonstrated therapeutic cefazolin levels for gram-positive cocci (greater than 1 microgram/g), a considerable portion of obese and extremely obese did not achieve minimal inhibitory concentrations of greater than 4 micrograms/g for Gram-negative rods in adipose samples at skin incision (20% and 33.3%, respectively) or closure (20.0% and 44.4%, respectively). No significant difference in cefazolin concentration was observed in mean closure adipose, myometrial, or serum specimens across the BMI categories.

Conclusion

Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that present antibiotic prophylaxis dosing may fail to provide adequate antimicrobial coverage in obese patients during cesarean delivery.

Antimicrobial dosing recommendations by patient risk and organ function — We recommend use of standard doses of antimicrobial agents for lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of higher dosages of antimicrobial agents for selected higher-risk patients with severe or advanced IAI or HA-IAI (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses for patients with significant renal impairment, with therapeutic drug monitoring where applicable (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected, hepatically cleared agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected agents for management of IAI in obese patients (Grade 2-B). We suggest that prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents does not need to be used routinely for treatment of IAI, but is an option for critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

### The pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in patients with obesity: a systematic review and consensus guidelines for dose adjustments [^117GZAbp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Obesity can cause physiological changes resulting in antibiotic pharmacokinetic alterations and suboptimal drug exposures. This systematic review aimed to summarise the available evidence on this topic and provide guidance for dose adjustment of antibiotics in adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2). We searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases to find relevant studies published between database inception and Dec 30, 2023. We initially identified 6113 studies, which became 4654 studies after duplicate removal, and 128 studies were included in the final review. β-lactam antibiotics were most commonly studied (57 studies), followed by the group of glycopeptides, lipoglycopeptides, and oxazolidinones (45 studies). The certainty of evidence was low or very low for all antibiotics and a meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of study populations and methods. Obesity modestly alters the pharmacokinetics of β-lactam antibiotics, but evidence does not support routine dose adjustments. For aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, the impact of obesity on pharmacokinetics is evident and weight-based dosing is recommended. Data are sparse for other antibiotic classes and research needs are described. In the absence of robust pharmacokinetic data, therapeutic drug monitoring can be used to guide individualised dosing.

### Obstetric surgical site infections: 2 grams compared with 3 grams of cefazolin in morbidly obese women [^115fNkAH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether morbidly obese gravid patients were less likely to develop a surgical site infection after receiving a higher dose of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of morbidly obese pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery was conducted at two tertiary care centers from 2008 to 2013. Exposure was defined as receiving 2 g compared with 3 g cefazolin preoperatively. Disease was defined by diagnosis of a surgical site infection using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. We estimated a sample size of 141 patients in each group for a 67% reduction (15% to 5%) in risk for a surgical site infection.

Results

There were 335 women included in the cohort with a median absolute weight of 310 (interquartile range 299–333) pounds. Forty-four (13.1%) women were diagnosed with a surgical site infection. There was no difference in surgical site infection among those women who received 2 g compared with 3 g cefazolin (13.1% [23/175] compared with 13.1% [21/160]; p = 0.996). Labor (crude odds ratio [OR] 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–4.40), internal labor monitoring (OR 2.78, 1.45–5.31), blood loss greater than 1,500 mL (OR 2.15, 1.09–5.78), and staple closure (OR 2.2, 1.15–4.21) were associated with a surgical site infection among the entire cohort. After multivariable analysis, blood loss greater than 1,500 mL (adjusted OR 3.32, 1.32–8.37) and staple closure (adjusted OR 2.45, 1.19–5.02) remained associated with an increased risk for a surgical site infection, whereas 3 g cefazolin still was not associated with reduced risk for a surgical site infection (adjusted OR 1.33, 0.64–2.74).

Conclusion

In our multicenter retrospective cohort study, preoperative 3 g cefazolin prophylaxis administered to morbidly obese gravid patients did not reduce surgical site infections.

### A review on the anesthetic management of obese patients undergoing surgery [^115om6Xa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pre-anaesthetic medication

Pre-anaesthetic medications may be considered in obese patients undergoing surgeries as to alleviate surgical complications which can take the form of infections, gastrointestinal disturbances, postsurgical pain, hyper-coagulation and anxiety. Antimicrobials such as cefazolin can be appropriately administered as prophylaxis for the prevention of postsurgical infections. Obese individuals with body weight ≥ 120 kg will require a prophylaxis dose of 3 g of cefazolin to curb the risk of surgical-site infections. Nausea and vomiting may be commonly observed gastrointestinal disturbances. As means of preventing postsurgical nausea and vomiting, the preoperative use of dexamethasone combined with ondansetron and haloperidol can be considered. Pregabalin, gabapentin and melatonin can be used as prophylaxis treatment for alleviating postoperative pain. Thromboembolic stockings or low-dose subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can also be used to prevent the postsurgical development of thromboembolisms. The oral administration of benzodiazepines should also be considered for relieving surgical related anxiety.

Assessment for required postoperative care

Other factors in addition to obesity may cumulatively determine the extent and the nature of the treatment plan that may be required postoperatively in an obese patient. These factors may include the following: (1) the presence of comorbidities that were present prior to the surgery, (2) an OS-MRS score of 4–5 which indicates an increased risk, (3) the type of surgical procedure applied during surgery, (4) the presence of OSA that is untreated along with an existing need for postoperative opioids administered parentally, and (5) the competence level of the postoperative management team. The type of the surgery and the site at which the surgery was done are both major determinants that influence the degree of postsurgical care that may be required. Patients requiring the administration of long-acting opioids would have to be closely monitored for any complications that may potentially arise.

Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Urogynecologic surgery — surgical site infection (SSI) prophylaxis defines SSI and outlines prevention measures: SSI is defined as superficial when it occurs within 30 days and involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue and deep when it occurs within 30 days when no implant is left in place or within 1 year if an implant is in place and involves deep soft tissues; risk factors include obesity (BMI ≥ 30 or BMI Prime ≥ 1.2) and depth of subcutaneous tissue ≥ 3 cm. For skin and mucous membrane preparation, alcohol and aqueous-based solutions of chlorhexidine respectively, are first choices and povidone-iodine is considered if chlorhexidine is contraindicated. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces postoperative infection after hysterectomy from about 34% to 7–14%; a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is frequently used, with a recommended dose of 2 g intravenously within 1 h of skin incision, increased to 3 g for patients > 120 kg; in case of prolonged intervention or heavy bleeding (> 1500 mL), a second dose should be administered after two times the half-life of the chosen antibiotic, e.g., 4 h after the first dose for cefazolin; alternatives for severe beta-lactam allergy include clindamycin or metronidazole plus gentamicin or aztreonam. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision has been closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. No RCT has been conducted comparing use of vaginal mesh for prolapse surgery with or without antibiotics, and a national Norwegian registry study on midurethral slings concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced postoperative infections and pain, but not tape exposure. A Cochrane review showed no difference between preoperative skin washing with chlorhexidine solution versus usual soap or placebo but demonstrated efficacy of showering with some cleansing method versus no showering. Routine hair removal does not reduce SSI, and if hair should be removed to improve access to surgical site or to allow draping, it is preferable to use hair clippers instead of a razor, with depilating cream also an option that should be used by the patient the day before surgery.

### Pharmacokinetics of cefazolin prophylaxis in obese gravidae at time of cesarean delivery [^111wQGo8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of 2 g and 3 g doses of cefazolin when used for perioperative prophylaxis in obese gravidae undergoing cesarean delivery.

Study Design

We performed a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial from August 2013 to April 2014. Twenty-six obese women were randomized to receive either 2 or 3 g intravenous cefazolin within 30 minutes of a skin incision. Serial maternal plasma samples were obtained at specific time points up to 8 hours after drug administration. Umbilical cord blood was obtained after placental delivery. Maternal adipose samples were obtained prior to fascial entry, after closure of the hysterotomy, and subsequent to fascial closure. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined via noncompartmental analysis.

Results

The median area under the plasma concentration vs time curve was significantly greater in the 3 g group than in the 2 g group (27204 μg/mL per minute vs 14058 μg/mL per minute; p = 0.001). Maternal plasma concentrations had an impact by body mass index. For every 1 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index at the time of the cesarean delivery, there was an associated 13.77 μg/mL lower plasma concentration of cefazolin across all time points (P = .01). By the completion of cesarean delivery, cefazolin concentrations in maternal adipose were consistently above the minimal inhibitory concentration for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with both the 2 g and 3 g doses. The median umbilical cord blood concentrations were significantly higher in the 3 g vs the 2 g group (34.5 μg/mL and 21.4 μg/mL; p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Cefazolin concentrations in maternal adipose both at time of hysterotomy closure and fascial closure were above the minimal inhibitory concentration for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when either 2 g or 3 g cefazolin was administered as perioperative surgical prophylaxis. Maternal cefazolin concentrations in plasma and maternal adipose tissue are related to both dose and body mass index.

β-Lactams

A study that evaluated critically ill patients (49 obese and 59 nonobese patients; 49% with lung infection) who had received broad-spectrum β-lactams (cefepime, piperacillin and tazobactam, or meropenem) at standard dosing regimens found considerable variability in β-lactam serum concentrations (coefficient of variation of 50–92% for all drugs) in obese and nonobese patients. The standard dosing regimens resulted in insufficient plasma concentrations in 32% of patients and overdosed concentrations in 25%. For meropenem, more obese patients had concentrations that did not reach therapeutic targets than nonobese patients (35 versus 0%; P = 0.02), but no differences were observed for cefepime and piperacillin and tazobactam. In the same study, patients on continuous renal replacement therapy were more likely to have supertherapeutic β-lactam serum concentrations and less likely to have insufficient β-lactam serum concentrations.

### Evidence-based cesarean delivery: preoperative management (part 7) [^115nV73t]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Preoperative preparation for cesarean delivery is a multistep approach for which protocols should exist at each hospital system. These protocols should be guided by the findings of this review. The interventions reviewed and recommendations made for this review have a common goal of decreasing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality related to cesarean delivery. The preoperative period starts before the patient's arrival to the hospital and ends immediately before skin incision. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends showering with either soap or an antiseptic solution at least the night before a procedure. Skin cleansing in addition to this has not been shown to further decrease rates of infection. Hair removal at the cesarean skin incision site is not necessary, but if preferred by the surgical team then clipping or depilatory creams should be used rather than shaving. Preoperative enema is not recommended. A clear liquid diet may be ingested up to 2 hours before and a light meal up to 6 hours before cesarean delivery. Consider giving a preoperative carbohydrate drink to nondiabetic patients up to 2 hours before planned cesarean delivery. Weight-based intravenous cefazolin is recommended 60 minutes before skin incision: 1–2 g intravenous for patients without obesity and 2 g for patients with obesity or weight ≥ 80 kg. Adjunctive azithromycin 500 mg intravenous is recommended for patients with labor or rupture of membranes. Preoperative gabapentin can be considered as a way to decrease pain scores with movement in the postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (1 g in 10–20 mL of saline or 10 mg/kg intravenous) is recommended prophylactically for patients at high risk of postpartum hemorrhage and can be considered in all patients. Routine use of mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is recommended preoperatively and is to be continued until the patient is ambulatory. Music and active warming of the patient, and adequate operating room temperature improves outcomes for the patient and neonate, respectively. Noise levels should allow clear communication between teams; however, a specific decibel level has not been defined in the data. Patient positioning with left lateral tilt decreases hypotensive episodes compared with right lateral tilt, which is not recommended. Manual displacers result in fewer hypotensive episodes than left lateral tilt. Both vaginal and skin preparation should be performed with either chlorhexidine (preferred) or povidone iodine. Placement of an indwelling urinary catheter is not necessary. Nonadhesive drapes are recommended. Cell salvage, although effective for high-risk patients, is not recommended for routine use.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^115WZ73C]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

It has already been shown that none of the current existing equations to estimate glomerular filtration are adequate to properly identify ARC in the intensive care unit patient; ARC is best identified in the clinical setting by urine collects lasting several hours. In our study, we found no difference in measured and estimated CrCL, but our study was probably underpowered for this analysis. In other studies, CrCL CG has been shown to over-estimate CrCL 24h in obese patients, thus providing an explanation why five patients in our cohort received greater doses of antibiotics than if their dosage regimen had been adapted to their CrCL 24h. ARC has probably been overlooked in the obese patient population because very few studies actually measure or estimate CrCL in infected, obese, non-critically ill patients, particularly when patients appear to have a 'normal' renal function such as a serum creatinine value less than 1.0 mg dL −1. Furthermore, PK studies in obese patients are very limited, and cohorts are small. More studies are needed to identify obese patients with ARC. However, even if a patient with ARC is identified, there is currently no recommended upward daily dose adjustment for patients with a CrCL > 80 mL min −1.

Piperacillin and tazobactam

There is little information regarding penicillin dosing in the obese population with pneumonia. The pharmacokinetic properties of piperacillin and tazobactam have been described in obese patients with infections other than pneumonia. In a 33-year-old morbidly obese patient (BMI = 55 kg/m 2) with a surgical site infection following a transfemoral left leg amputation receiving piperacillin and tazobactam at 4.5 g every 6 h as a 30-min infusion, the percentage free drug T > 4 × MIC and percentage free drug T > MIC were 25 and 60% of the dosing interval, respectively. A study of 14 hospitalized obese patients (weight > 120 kg, BMI = 52.3 ± 10.8 kg/m 2) receiving piperacillin and tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h or 6.75 g every 8 h infused over 4 h found the pharmacokinetics were different compared with nonobese patients. For piperacillin, the probability of target attainment for at least 50% of free drug T > MIC was at least 91% for doses of at least 4.5 g every 8 h at MICs of 16 μg/ml or less. For tazobactam, the probability of target attainment was 57, 84, and 94% for doses of 4.5, 6.75, and 9.0 g every 8 h, respectively. On the basis of the available data, higher doses of piperacillin and tazobactam and longer infusion time of up to 4 h may be required in obese patients.

Cephalosoprins

Analysis of serial serum cefepime concentrations after dosing in 10 morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40 kg/m 2; estimated GFR = 108.4 ± 34.6 ml/min) found that an increased dose of 2 g every 8 h was necessary to maintain an adequate free drug T > MIC throughout the dosing interval. Therefore, the use of the upper limit of normal doses of cephalosporins is recommended in obese patients.

### Antimicrobial dosing in specific populations and novel clinical methodologies: obesity [^112NfZ2k]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity and its related comorbidities can negatively influence the outcomes of certain infectious diseases. Specific dosing recommendations are often lacking in the product label for patients with obesity that leads to unclear guidance in practice. Higher rates of therapeutic failure have been reported with some fixed dose antibiotics and pragmatic approaches to dose modification are limited for orally administered agents. For i.v. antimicrobials dosed on weight, alternate body size descriptors (ABSDs) have been used to reduce the risk of overdosing. These ABSDs are mathematical transformations of height and weight that represent fat-free weight and follow the same principles as body surface area (BSA)-based dosing of cancer chemotherapy. However, ABSDs are rarely studied in pivotal phase III studies and so can risk the underdosing of antimicrobials in patients with obesity when incorrectly applied in the real-world setting. Specific case examples are presented to highlight these risks. Although general principles may be considered by clinicians, a universal approach to dose modification in obesity is unlikely. Studies that can better distinguish human body phenotypes may help reduce our reliance on height and weight to define dosing. Simple and complex technologies exist to quantify individual body composition that could improve upon our current approach. Early evidence suggests that body composition parameters repurposed from medical imaging data may improve upon height and weight as covariates of drug clearance and distribution. Clinical trials that can integrate human body phenotyping may help us identify new approaches to optimal dose selection of antimicrobials in patients with obesity.

2.3 Dosage for Perioperative Prophylaxis

Dosage for Perioperative Prophylaxis in Adults with CLcr Equal to 55 mL/min or Greater

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, recommended dosages are described in Table 3 below.

If a dose of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is required that does not equal 1 gram, 2 grams, or 3 grams, this product is not recommended and an alternative formulation of cefazolin should be considered.

It is important that (i) the preoperative dose be given just prior (1/2 hour to 1 hour) to the start of surgery so that adequate antibacterial concentrations are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (ii) cefazolin be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient concentrations of the antibacterial drug at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms.

The perioperative prophylactic administration of cefazolin should usually be discontinued within a 24-hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of cefazolin may be continued for 3 days to 5 days following the completion of surgery.

### Cefoxitin plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue concentration in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy [^111JZ5Hh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Antibiotic dosing in obese surgical patients has not been adequately evaluated. The objective of this study was to identify whether currently prescribed doses of cefoxitin achieve adequate and sustained plasma and tissue concentrations in obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.

Methods

A prospective evaluation of plasma and tissue cefoxitin concentrations in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy was performed. On the day of the surgical procedure, venous blood samples (5 mL) were collected just before cefoxitin administration and then at 5, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after dose administration. In addition, subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected from the surgical site at the time of surgical incision and at closure. Cefoxitin concentrations in the collected samples were quantified by using an HPLC-ultraviolet method. A standard noncompartmental analysis was performed for each individual cefoxitin plasma concentration-time profile. In addition, the ratio of tissue to plasma concentration was calculated for all patients.

Findings

Plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of cefoxitin were evaluated in 6 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy. The mean age and BMI were 48.7 (6.2) years and 42.8 (7.1) kg/m(2), respectively. At the time of surgical closure, subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations of cefoxitin were subtherapeutic (< 8 µg/mL) in all evaluated patients.

Implications

Current dosing strategies for cefoxitin in obese surgical patients may be inadequate, and there is an urgent need to define the appropriate dosage.

### Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of cefoxitin in obesity: implications for risk of surgical site infection [^1149CpMx]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a significant risk factor for surgical site infections (SSIs), for poorly understood reasons. SSIs are a major cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased health care cost. Drug disposition in general is frequently altered in the obese. Preoperative antibiotic administration, achieving adequate tissue concentrations at the time of incision, is an essential strategy to prevent SSIs. Nonetheless, there is little information regarding antibiotic concentrations in obese surgical patients. This investigation tested the hypothesis that the prophylactic antibiotic cefoxitin may have delayed and/or diminished tissue penetration in the obese.

Methods

Plasma and tissue concentrations of cefoxitin were determined in obese patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery (body mass index 43 ± 10 kg/m(2), n = 14, 2 g cefoxitin) and in normal-weight patients and healthy volunteers (body mass index 20 ± 2 kg/m(2), n = 13, 1 g cefoxitin). Tissue concentrations were measured using a microdialysis probe in the subcutaneous layer of the abdomen, and in adipose tissue excised at the time of incision and wound closure.

Results

Plasma concentrations and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were approximately 2-fold higher in the obese patients because of the 2-fold-higher dose. Dose-normalized concentrations were higher, although AUCs were not significantly different. Measured and dose-normalized subcutaneous cefoxitin concentrations and AUCs in the obese patients were significantly lower than in the normal-weight subjects. There was an inverse relationship between cefoxitin tissue penetration (AUC(tissue)/AUC(plasma) ratio) and body mass index. Tissue penetration was substantially lower in the obese patients (0.08 ± 0.07 vs 0.37 ± 0.26, P < 0.05). Adipose tissue cefoxitin concentrations in obese patients were only 7.8 ± 7.3 and 2.7 ± 1.4 μg/g, respectively, at incision and closure, below the minimum inhibitory concentration of 8 and 16 μg/mL, respectively, for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

Conclusion

Obese surgical patients have impaired tissue penetration of the prophylactic antibiotic cefoxitin, and inadequate tissue concentrations despite increased clinical dose (2 g). Inadequate tissue antibiotic concentrations may be a factor in the increased risk of SSIs in obese surgical patients. Additional studies are needed to define doses achieving adequate tissue concentrations.

### Association between antimicrobial prophylaxis with double-dose cefuroxime and surgical site infections in patients weighing 80 kg or more [^114qfBFF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Many guidelines recommend a weight-adopted dose increase of cefuroxime for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP). However, the evidence that this approach is associated with lower rates of surgical site infection (SSI) is limited.

Objective

To assess whether double-dose cefuroxime SAP was associated with a decreased SSI rate in patients weighing at least 80 kg.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adult patients (> 18 years) weighing at least 80 kg who underwent 9 major surgical procedures with a cefuroxime SAP administration from the Swissnoso SSI surveillance system between January 2015 and December 2019 at 142 Swiss hospitals. The follow-up was 30 days for all surgical procedures and 1 year for implant-related operations.

Exposures

Cefuroxime SAP dose (1.5 vs 3.0 g).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall SSI. A mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for institutional, epidemiological, and perioperative variables was applied. Results were stratified by weight categories as well as by wound contamination classes.

Results

Of 41 076 eligible patients, 37 640 were included, with 22 625 (60.1%) men and a median (IQR) age of 61.9 (49.9–71.1) years. The outcome SSI was met by 1203 patients (3.2%). Double-dose cefuroxime was administered to 13 246 patients (35.2%) and was not significantly associated with a lower SSI rate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.02; p = 0.10). After stratification by weight category, double-dose SAP vs single-dose SAP was associated with lower SSI rates among 16 605 patients weighing at least 80 to less than 90 kg (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.97; p = 0.02) but not in the other weight categories (≥ 90 to < 100 kg, 10 342 patients: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87–1.47; p = 0.37; ≥ 100 to < 120 kg, 8099 patients: aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.76–1.30; p = 0.96; ≥ 120 kg, 2594 patients: aOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42–1.04; p = 0.06). After stratification by contamination class, double-dose SAP was associated with lower SSI rates among 1946 patients with contaminated wounds (aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30–0.84; p = 0.008) but not those with clean wounds (25 680 patients; aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76–1.12; p = 0.44) or clean-contaminated wounds (10 014 patients; aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73–1.12; p = 0.37) compared with a single dose.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, double-dose SAP with cefuroxime for patients weighing at least 80 kg was not consistently associated with a lower SSI rate.

### Cefazolin alone versus cefazolin with tobramycin or gentamicin as intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for single-level posterior lumbar fusion [^114Vhbic]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Lumbar fusions are common proceduresfor which surgical site infections (SSIs) are a rare, potentially devastating complication. As such, several efforts are made to minimize the risk of SSIs, including optimizing perioperative antibiotics. Although cefazolin is the most commonly used perioperative antibiotic, the addition of aminoglycosides (gentamycin or tobramycin) is considered at some centers.

For lumbar fusions, SSIs occur in approximately 0.4 to 4% of cases. Factors associated with the development of SSI include patient characteristics (such as diabetes, steroid use, and morbid obesity), and surgical variables (such as approach, open versus minimally invasive, and instrumentation). For all patients, prophylactic antibiotics are the standard of care to minimize the risk of SSI.

While a single dose of cefazolin is the most common perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis regimen used, the addition of an aminoglycoside is considered at some centers. These provide gram-negative coverage but are also associated with risks such as renal complications. Several single-institution retrospective studies have concluded that the addition of an aminoglycoside (either gentamicin or tobramycin) is not associated with a markedly decreased rate of SSI among patients undergoing several orthopaedic procedures including femoral neck fracture fixation and neuromuscular scoliosis fusions. Furthermore, several meta-analyses have demonstrated increased rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) among orthopaedic patients receiving gentamicin prophylaxis.

A meta-analysis that pooled six prospective, randomized clinical trials examined a cohort of 843 patients undergoing various spinal procedures, not limited to spinal fusions, demonstrated efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic regimens in markedly decreasing the infection rate from 5.9% to 2.2%, but did not identify the benefit of additional gram-negative coverage because it found similar SSI rates among cohorts assigned to a cephalosporin arm or a vancomycin and gentamicin arm. However, this study grouped together patients undergoing a variety of spinal procedures and varied the gram-positive coverage between the study groups.

This study sought to examine 90-day postoperative outcomes and 2-year revision rates among a national cohort of patients undergoing single-level posterior lumbar fusions (PLFs) in a large national database using administrative coding for the administration of cefazolin versus cefazolin and either gentamicin or tobramycin. The goal of this study was to compare the SSI rates of the two groups and put this in the context of potential associated adverse outcomes.

### Plasma concentrations of caspofungin in a critically ill patient with morbid obesity [^116xac97]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

There are conflicting data on dosing recommendations in obese patients. Payne and Hall found that lower caspofungin AUC was achieved in obese people than in thinner ones, suggesting that dose optimization in heavier patients might improve clinical success rates. If the labelled dose of 70 mg/day had been used in our patient, AUC/MIC would have been 786, below the target AUC/MIC value. Figure 1 shows caspofungin concentrations over time for doses of 100 and 70 mg/day. A dose of 150 mg/day has been recommended in obese patients until simulation studies are completed to provide a bedside dosing formula for caspofungin. There are reports of deterioration of hemodynamic parameters during loading doses in critically ill patients. The monitoring of hemodynamic parameters in these patients is highly recommended. The dose of caspofungin should be adjusted according to both serum caspofungin concentrations and clinical symptoms. However, determination of caspofungin concentrations is performed at only a few laboratories, which makes routine monitoring difficult. This case suggests that caspofungin doses higher than those recommended by the manufacturer may be needed to reach pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets in ICU morbidly obese patients.
