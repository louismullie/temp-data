## Question

Heparin drip duration for pulmonary embolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a heparin drip should be continued in acute pulmonary embolism and what the evidence-based rationale is for that duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with high-risk, intermediate-risk, or low-risk PE. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about initial parenteral anticoagulation duration and overlap with oral therapy. Next, I will examine the evidence base for 5 days of parenteral therapy and whether shorter courses are acceptable in selected patients. After that, I need to check special scenarios like thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, and renal failure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm any exceptions that might change the plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Acute PE is managed in phases: the acute phase (first 5–10 days), long-term therapy (about 3 months), and extended therapy beyond 3 months if indicated, with the initial parenteral anticoagulation typically spanning the acute phase and overlapping with oral therapy when a vitamin K antagonist is used [^c38df8bc] [^41dc5555].

> I should confirm the standard duration of parenteral therapy. The CHEST guideline recommends initial treatment with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux for at least 5 days, and if a VKA is used, the parenteral agent should be continued until the INR is therapeutic for at least 24 hours, which practically means about 5 days in most cases; this is a Grade 1C recommendation and reflects long-standing practice [^dba6bced] [^efc160e1].

> Wait, let me verify whether shorter parenteral courses are acceptable in some patients. The PEITHO-2 trial showed that in intermediate-risk PE, a 72-hour course of parenteral heparin followed by dabigatran was effective and safe, with low 6-month recurrence and acceptable bleeding, suggesting that a 3-day parenteral phase can work in carefully selected patients when transitioning to a DOAC; however, this is a single-arm study and not a blanket endorsement for all PE patients, so I should be cautious about generalizing it [^af21091c].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for the 5-day minimum. The 5-day target arose from historical trials and practice patterns showing that shorter parenteral courses were associated with higher recurrence, whereas extending beyond 5 days without oral overlap did not clearly improve outcomes; moreover, achieving therapeutic anticoagulation promptly is associated with better outcomes, and the 5-day window balances efficacy and bleeding risk while allowing time for oral therapy to take effect when used [^dba6bced] [^261fcc5b].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. If the patient receives systemic thrombolysis, UFH is typically held during lysis and restarted afterward with close monitoring; in this setting, the total parenteral duration still follows the same principle of at least 5 days and until INR is therapeutic if using a VKA, though some protocols individualize based on bleeding risk and clinical response, so I need to ensure I align with local PERT pathways and guideline nuances [^cd004750] [^dba6bced]. For catheter-directed thrombolysis, many programs continue UFH for 24–48 hours post-procedure before transitioning, but again, this is protocol-dependent and should be individualized, so I should confirm institutional standards [^notfound]. In renal failure or when rapid reversibility is needed, UFH is preferred and the same 5-day minimum and INR overlap rule apply if a VKA is planned, with adjustments for aPTT monitoring and bleeding risk [^f8042350] [^dba6bced].

> Let me consider DOAC monotherapy options because this affects parenteral duration. Rivaroxaban and apixaban can be used as single-drug therapy from the outset, eliminating the need for parenteral bridging; dabigatran and edoxaban require a 5-day parenteral lead-in, so in those regimens the heparin drip would indeed be 5 days before switching to the oral agent, which is a key distinction I should emphasize [^d33920f4] [^c38df8bc].

> I should double-check the practical implications for UFH dosing and monitoring. Weight-based nomograms (e.g., 80 units/kg bolus then 18 units/kg/hour) achieve therapeutic anticoagulation faster than fixed dosing, and delays in achieving therapeutic aPTT correlate with worse outcomes; therefore, even if the nominal duration is 5 days, poor control could necessitate longer UFH use or a change in strategy, which I need to monitor closely [^0d0065c1] [^261fcc5b].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is as follows: for most patients with acute PE who are started on UFH, continue the heparin drip for at least 5 days and ensure overlap with oral anticoagulation until the INR is therapeutic for 24 hours if using a VKA; in selected intermediate-risk patients transitioning to dabigatran, a 72-hour parenteral course may be acceptable based on PEITHO-2, but this is not a universal substitute for the 5-day standard; if using rivaroxaban or apixaban monotherapy, no parenteral therapy is needed at all, and if using dabigatran or edoxaban, a 5-day parenteral lead-in is required [^dba6bced] [^af21091c] [^d33920f4] [^c38df8bc].

> Final answer: The typical duration of a heparin drip for acute pulmonary embolism is at least 5 days, with continuation until the INR is therapeutic for 24 hours if overlapping with a vitamin K antagonist; shorter parenteral courses (about 3 days) may be appropriate in carefully selected intermediate-risk patients transitioning directly to dabigatran, and no parenteral therapy is needed when using rivaroxaban or apixaban monotherapy, so the exact duration depends on the oral agent chosen and patient risk profile [^dba6bced] [^af21091c] [^d33920f4] [^c38df8bc].

---

The duration of a heparin drip for pulmonary embolism (PE) is **typically 5 days** [^dba6bced], overlapping with warfarin until the INR is therapeutic (≥ 2.0) for at least 24 hours [^efc160e1]. If a DOAC is used, heparin is stopped when the DOAC is initiated, usually after 5 days [^c38df8bc]. For high-risk PE, continue heparin until hemodynamic stability and reperfusion therapy are complete, then transition to oral anticoagulation. Prolonged heparin beyond 5 days is reserved for special cases (e.g. severe renal impairment, active bleeding, or when oral therapy is delayed) [^notfound].

---

## Standard duration of heparin drip

- **Standard duration**: 5 days of therapeutic heparin (UFH or LMWH) [^dba6bced] is recommended for acute PE, overlapping with warfarin until the INR is therapeutic (≥ 2.0) for at least 24 hours [^efc160e1].

- **DOAC transition**: When using DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban), heparin is typically discontinued when the DOAC is initiated, usually after 5 days [^c38df8bc].

- **Rationale**: The 5-day minimum ensures adequate initial anticoagulation while oral therapy takes effect and reduces recurrence risk [^ce09db17].

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing duration

Several scenarios may **require adjustments** to the standard 5-day duration:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk PE (massive or submassive) | Continue until hemodynamic stability and reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy) are complete | High-risk PE requires aggressive management and close monitoring [^bfdb205e] [^e5e7a442] |
| Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | Extend heparin duration or adjust dose based on renal function | Heparin is preferred in renal impairment due to its metabolism and reversibility [^f8042350] |
| Active bleeding or high bleeding risk | Shorten duration or consider alternative anticoagulation strategies | Balancing thrombosis and bleeding risk is critical [^c38df8bc] |
| Delayed initiation of oral anticoagulation | Extend heparin until oral therapy is initiated and therapeutic | Ensures continuous anticoagulation coverage [^dba6bced] |

---

## Risks associated with prolonged heparin use

Prolonged heparin therapy increases **bleeding risk**, including major hemorrhage and HIT [^notfound]. Regular monitoring of aPTT, platelets, and clinical bleeding is essential [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from ACCP, ESC, and ASH consistently recommend a **5-day heparin course** with overlap for warfarin and early transition to DOACs when appropriate [^dba6bced] [^d71c638e] [^826b276b]. Individualize duration based on renal function, bleeding risk, and clinical stability [^c38df8bc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 5 days of therapeutic heparin, overlapping with warfarin until INR ≥ 2.0 for 24 hours [^dba6bced].

- **DOAC transition**: Stop heparin when DOAC is initiated, typically after 5 days [^c38df8bc].

- **High-risk PE**: Continue heparin until hemodynamic stability and reperfusion therapy are complete [^notfound].

- **Special cases**: Adjust duration for renal impairment, bleeding risk, or delayed oral therapy [^f8042350].

---

The typical heparin drip duration for PE is **5 days**, with adjustments for high-risk PE, renal impairment, bleeding risk, or delayed oral therapy. Prolonged heparin increases bleeding risk, so monitor closely and transition promptly to oral anticoagulation when feasible [^c38df8bc].

### Safe-dose thrombolysis plus rivaroxaban for moderate and severe pulmonary embolism: drip, drug, and discharge [^bbaf47e1]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombolysis, though very effective, has not been embraced as routine therapy for symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) except in very severe cases. Rivaroxaban recently has been approved for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). There are no data on the combined use of thrombolysis and rivaroxaban in PE.

Hypothesis

"Safe dose" thrombolysis (SDT) plus new oral anticoagulants are expected to become an appealing, safe and effective approach in the treatment of moderate and severe PE in the near future, thereby drastically reducing hospitalization time.

Methods

Over a 12-month period, 98 consecutive patients with symptomatic PE were treated by a combination of SDT and rivaroxaban. The SDT was started in parallel with unfractionated heparin and given in 2 hours. Heparin was given for a total of 24 hours and rivaroxaban started at 15 or 20 mg daily 2 hours after termination of heparin infusion.

Results

There was no bleeding due to SDT. Recurrent VTE occurred in 3 patients who had been switched to warfarin. No patient on rivaroxaban developed VTE. Two patients died of cancer at a mean follow-up of 12 ± 2 months. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure dropped from 52.8 ± 3.9 mm Hg before to 32 ± 4.4 mm Hg within 36 hours of SDT (P < 0.001). The duration of hospitalization for patients presenting primarily for PE was 1.9 ± 0.2 days.

Conclusions

"Safe dose" thrombolysis plus rivaroxaban is highly safe and effective in the treatment of moderate and severe PE, leading to favorable early and intermediate-term outcomes and early discharge.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### Unsolved issues in the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^c7190352]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

The three most controversial and unsolved issues in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) are: (1) the role of thrombolysis, (2) the role of low molecular weight heparin and length of hospital stay, and (3) the optimal duration of anticoagulation. The trend is to use thrombolysis more frequently, to administer low molecular weight heparin and shorten the hospitalization duration in low-risk patients, and to give prolonged courses of anticoagulation with warfarin. PE thrombolysis appears most beneficial in patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes in whom the potential hazards of bleeding can be justified by the danger of conservative management with anticoagulation alone. With respect to utilizing low molecular weight heparin as a way of shortening the duration of hospitalization, there are no data to warrant this approach. The current FDA mandate for symptomatic PE patients is to administer intravenous unfractionated heparin administered as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin. Finally, the optimal duration of anticoagulation following acute PE remains mired in controversy. Despite the high rate of recurrent venous thrombosis after discontinuation of anticoagulation, there are currently insufficient data to recommend indefinite warfarin therapy.

### Factors in initial anticoagulation choice in hospitalized patients with pulmonary embolism [^678b95ab]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Fear of Decompensation

Fear of decompensation and/or bleeding from the PE was a central factor associated with UFH use cited by participants. Participants voiced less concern for or knowledge of iatrogenic bleeding caused by the anticoagulant and instead worried about how to manage bleeding should it arise. Those who used an LMWH-dominant approach did not voice this fear, noting that few patients ultimately require catheter-directed treatment or rescue therapy. Furthermore, they reported working in systems in which LMWH was not a contraindication to either thrombolysis or catheter-directed treatment. Nearly all participants specifically cited the quick off of UFH, valuing the short half-life of UFH, and cited that UFH afforded the ability for any procedures a patient may need even if none was anticipated.

Misperception of Pharmacology of Anticoagulants

In many cases, participants reported choosing UFH because they perceived it to be stronger and have a quicker onset of action than other anticoagulants. The maxim "quick on, quick off" (ie, near-immediate achievement of therapeutic effect and fast wearing off once medication is stopped) was used nearly ubiquitously by participants. The perception among participants was that because UFH was given intravenously, it achieved therapeutic anticoagulation nearly immediately. The perception of UFH as stronger than other anticoagulants was particularly valued when clinicians were worried about substantial clot burden or potential decompensation. As an emergency medicine physician from a community practice in the South said, "[UFH] is an [intravenous] drip. So, in my mind, it's gonna be quicker".

Toward the end of many interviews, several participants reconsidered their statements on the quick on of UFH. For example, a hospitalist from a hybrid practice in the Midwest, who stated at the beginning of the interview, "You're already anticoagulated as soon as you start [UFH] and there's minimal follow up" later in the interview stated, "I would actually consider people who are on LMWH therapeutic more quickly than those who are on UFH, because you have to check… you know, because of needing to keep an eye on the PTTs [partial thromboplastin times]… sometimes people don't really budge after their initial dosing".

### Update on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^8a180a87]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease. In the US, an estimated 40–53 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with PE annually and approximately 60,000 die from the disease. Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are non-specific; however, a quick and accurate diagnosis is critical because, with appropriate therapy, the risk of recurrent (and potentially fatal) PE can be greatly reduced. Recent publication of prediction rules and improved non-invasive diagnostic tools have simplified diagnostic algorithms for PE. The efficacy of the standard treatment for PE, initial administration of continuous i.v. unfractionated heparin overlapped with long-term oral anticoagulation, is well established. However, newer treatment options such as low-molecular-weight heparins and the pentasaccharides may offer similar efficacy with improved convenience.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin compared with intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^b97bd85c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparin has greatly simplified the management of deep venous thrombosis. However, for patients who present with pulmonary embolism, the role of low-molecular-weight heparin is uncertain and unfractionated heparin remains widely used.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with that of dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin to treat acute pulmonary embolism.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 1 August 2003. Additional data sources were manual searches of abstract proceedings and personal contact with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing fixed-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin for the treatment of nonmassive symptomatic pulmonary embolism or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism in the context of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on study design; quality; and clinical outcomes, including symptomatic venous thromboembolism, death, and major and minor bleeding. Odds ratios for individual outcomes were calculated for each trial and were pooled by using the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen trials involving 2110 patients with pulmonary embolism met the inclusion criteria. Separate outcome data for patients with pulmonary embolism were not available from 2 trials (159 patients), leaving 12 trials for meta-analysis. Compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin was associated with a non-statistically significant decrease in recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism at the end of treatment (1.4% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.18]) and at 3 months (3.0% vs. 4.4%; odds ratio, 0.68 [CI, 0.42 to 1.09]). Similar estimates were obtained for patients who presented with symptomatic pulmonary embolism (1.7% vs. 2.3%; odds ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.35 to 1.48]) or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (1.2% vs. 3.2%; odds ratio, 0.53 [CI, 0.15 to 1.88]). For major bleeding complications, the odds ratio favoring low-molecular-weight heparin (1.3% vs. 2.1%; odds ratio, 0.67 [CI, 0.36 to 1.27]) was also not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin treatment appears to be as effective and safe as dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of nonmassive pulmonary embolism.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^c7849dc9]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation, provoked PE, ASH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining testing for thrombophilia to guide anticoagulant treatment duration after primary short-term treatment in patients with VTE provoked by a non-surgical major transient risk factor. Consider continuing anticoagulant treatment indefinitely in patients with thrombophilia and discontinuing it in patients without thrombophilia.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^665607fd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. For many of the dilemmas the evidence base is not substantial and is potentially hampered by reporting bias. Management in an individual patient will require clinical assessment of risks and benefits and will also depend on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: current therapy [^f8042350]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the two most important manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular disease in the United States. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of VTE treatment. Most patients with deep venous thrombosis or low-risk pulmonary embolism can be treated in the outpatient setting with low-molecular-weight heparin and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Inpatient treatment of VTE begins with parenteral agents, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin. Unfractionated heparin is used if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or has severe renal insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are an alternative; however, concerns include cost and use of reversing agents (currently available only for dabigatran, although others are in development). If warfarin, dabigatran, or edoxaban is used, low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin must be administered concomitantly for at least five days and, in the case of warfarin, until the international normalized ratio becomes therapeutic for 24 hours. Hemodynamically unstable patients with a low bleeding risk may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. An inferior vena cava filter is not indicated for patients treated with anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of three months. Special situations, such as active cancer and pregnancy, require long-term use of low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation beyond three months should be individualized based on a risk/benefit analysis. Symptomatic distal deep venous thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation, but asymptomatic patients may be monitored with serial imaging for two weeks and treated only if there is extension.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^b2a8c255]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^8502c141]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

### Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions [^133596fb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2–3. This initial period of 3 months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit-risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

### Use of fibrinolytics for the management of massive pulmonary embolism in a patient with a history of subdural hemorrhage [^65c51055]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Management of massive pulmonary embolism in patients with hemodynamic instability encompasses the use of fibrinolytics. Use of fibrinolytic therapy is currently recommended in this patient population by ACCP, AHA, and EHA if treatment benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. There is currently no data challenging or exploring the risk of using fibrinolytic therapy for the management of massive PE in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage.

Case Presentation

A 38-year old female with suspected massive pulmonary embolism was admitted with a chief complaint of chest pain and right leg pain. Shortly after a confirmatory CT of bilateral PE, the patient had multiple cardiac arrests along with severe shock that led to a general agreement among the team to proceed with IV and then catheter-directed TPA as well as thrombectomy. Following fibrinolytic therapy, the patient was started on a heparin drip along with epinephrine for hemodynamic support. CT chest angiography showed the resolution of emboli following treatment with the fibrinolytic agent. CT of the head taken approximately 24 h post tPA initiation was used to rule out intracranial hemorrhage or other complications resulting from tPA administration.

Conclusion

In patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage, catheter guided fibrinolytic and thrombectomy may be effective treatment options of massive pulmonary embolism.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to offer a VKA as an alternative to a DOAC in patients with PE, overlapping with parenteral anticoagulation until an INR of 2.5 (range 2–3) is reached.

### Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism [^45dc0919]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2–4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2–3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^84f8d381]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can travel from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, up to the lungs. Previously, a pulmonary embolism was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. Recently, however, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. The new drugs have characteristics that may be favourable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re-dosing and few known drug interactions. To date, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment (minimum duration of three months) of pulmonary embolism.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). Clinical trials databases were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a pulmonary embolism confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the long-term (minimum duration three months) treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LR, JM) independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third author (PK). We used meta-analyses when we considered heterogeneity low. The two primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism. Other outcomes included all-cause mortality and major bleeding. We calculated all outcomes using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 7897 participants. Two studies tested oral DTIs (dabigatran) and three studies tested oral factor Xa inhibitors (one rivaroxaban, one edoxaban and one apixaban). Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of oral DTIs and standard anticoagulation in preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.04; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence), recurrent venous thromboembolism (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.66; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.13; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.68; two studies; 1527 participants; high quality evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors, when we combined the three included studies together in meta-analyses, there was significant heterogeneity for recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.56; two studies; 4509 participants; I(2) = 58%; moderate quality evidence). The oral factor Xa inhibitors were no more or less effective in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.15; three studies; 6295 participants; high quality evidence), DVT (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; two studies; 4509 participants; high quality evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.70; one study; 4817 participants; moderate quality evidence) or major bleeding (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.62; two studies; 4507 participants; high quality evidence). None of the studies measured quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate to high quality evidence suggests that there are no differences between DOACs and standard anticoagulation for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism, for the outcomes recurrent pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism, DVT, all-cause mortality and major bleeding.

Recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism

Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients with acute PE to reduce the risk of early death and recurrent symptomatic or fatal VTE. Patients with high‐risk PE should receive prompt intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to reperfusion 10. Guideline‐recommended options for anticoagulation in patients with confirmed non‐high‐risk PE include 10, 11:
A DOAC approved as a single‐drug therapy (apixaban or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation followed by a DOAC (e.g. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)
Parenteral anticoagulation alone

From a patient and health care provider prospective, some of the DOACs offer several practical advantages over VKAs, including the lack of requirements for bridging anticoagulant injections, coagulation monitoring, limited dietary restrictions, and fewer drug–drug interactions 30. By simplifying VTE treatment, DOACs make outpatient PE therapy more tolerable and feasible. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban, both approved as single‐drug therapies, facilitate initial outpatient PE treatment because they eliminate the need for parenteral anticoagulants (i.e. bridging therapy) 32, 33.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 2: treatment [^48d535a8]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) varies widely, ranging from only limited symptoms to severe cardiogenic shock. Treatment of PE comprises initial therapy — with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin — and long-term treatment, most commonly with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). Methods of risk stratification, to determine whether a patient will benefit from thrombolysis, are currently under investigation. However, at present, insufficient evidence exists that hemodynamically stable patients who demonstrate echocardiographic right ventricular strain (submassive PE) benefit from thrombolysis. By contrast, thrombolysis is a widely accepted treatment strategy for patients with hemodynamic shock (massive PE). The duration of VKA treatment is commonly 3–12 months and depends on the type of PE and on the balance between the risks of recurrent PE, major bleeding, and the patient's preference. In patients with a malignancy, treatment with LMWH during the first 6 months after diagnosis of PE is recommended. Several new oral anticoagulants, such as factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors, are now being investigated. For prevention of recurrent PE in situations where anticoagulation is contraindicated, a temporary inferior vena cava filter might be useful. Some patients with PE can be safely treated at home, but few outcome studies in this setting have been published.

### Managing pulmonary embolism from presentation to extended treatment [^7ff46560]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major healthcare problem. PE presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms, and confirmation of diagnosis involves the use of clinical risk scores, scanning techniques and laboratory tests. Treatment choice is informed by the risk of sudden death, with high-risk patients recommended to receive thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. Patients with less severe presentations are given anticoagulant therapy, traditionally with parenteral heparins in the acute phase of treatment, transitioning to oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The limitations of these agents and the introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants challenge this paradigm. To date, clinical studies of four non-VKA oral anticoagulants to treat acute thrombosis have been published, and rivaroxaban is now approved for treatment and prevention of PE (and deep vein thrombosis). Rivaroxaban and apixaban alone, and dabigatran and edoxaban after parenteral anticoagulant induction, were non-inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism; the risk of major bleeding was similar with dabigatran and edoxaban and significantly reduced with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Patients with an initial PE are recommended to receive continued anticoagulation for 3 months or longer, depending on individual risk factors, and studies of non-VKA oral anticoagulants have shown a continued benefit for up to 2 years, without a significantly increased risk of major bleeding. Given that the non-VKA oral anticoagulants are given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, their adoption is likely to ease the burden on both PE patients and healthcare practitioners when longer-term or extended anticoagulation is warranted.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review for a practice guideline [^b7e83265]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

New treatments are available for treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Purpose

To review the evidence on the efficacy of interventions for treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, MICROMEDEX, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the 1950s through June 2006.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews of trials; and observational studies; all restricted to English-language articles.

Data Extraction

Paired reviewers assessed study quality and abstracted data. The authors pooled results about optimal duration of anticoagulation.

Data Synthesis

This review includes 101 articles. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is modestly superior to unfractionated heparin at preventing recurrent DVT and is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin for treatment of pulmonary embolism. Outpatient treatment of venous thromboembolism is likely to be effective and safe in carefully chosen patients, with appropriate services available. Inpatient or outpatient use of LMWH is cost-saving or cost-effective compared with unfractionated heparin. In observational studies, catheter-directed thrombolysis safely restored vein patency in select patients. Moderately strong evidence supports early use of compression stockings to reduce postthrombotic syndrome. Limited evidence suggests that vena cava filters are only modestly efficacious for prevention of pulmonary embolism. Conventional-intensity oral anticoagulation beyond 12 months may be optimal for patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, although patients with transient risk factors benefit little from more than 3 months of therapy. High-quality trials support use of LMWH in place of oral anticoagulation, particularly in patients with cancer. Little evidence is available to guide treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.

Limitations

The authors could not address all management questions, and excluded non-English-language literature.

Conclusions

The strength of evidence varies across the study questions but generally is strong.

Summary

Despite advances in clinical decision support, the diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, treatment and disposition of emergency department patients with pulmonary embolism remain challenging. The use of diagnostic risk stratification tools and D‐dimer can decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast; however, D‐dimer is elevated in many conditions including normal pregnancy, so imaging is often indicated. Once diagnosed, prognostic risk stratification tools can inform treatment decisions across the risk spectrum, including identifying low‐risk patients with pulmonary embolism who can safely be treated at home. For patients requiring hospitalization, alternatives to unfractionated heparin can improve time to therapeutic anticoagulation and reduce treatment‐related bleeding risk.

### Treatment of venous thromboembolism [^c38df8bc]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common, potentially lethal condition with acute morbidity.

Objective

To review the etiology of VTE and the 3 phases of VTE treatment: acute (first 5–10 days), long-term (from end of acute treatment to 3–6 months), and extended (beyond 3–6 months).

Evidence Review

Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials, as well as other clinical trials for topics not covered by the former, were reviewed. Literature searches using broad terms were used to find meta-analyses published in the last 15 years. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was used to supplement the literature search. Guidelines from specialty organizations were consulted when relevant. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was searched for relevant cost-effectiveness studies. We also searched our own literature database of 8386 articles for relevant research.

Findings

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with with vitamin K antagonists and the benefits and proven safety of ambulation have allowed for outpatient management of most cases of DVT in the acute phase. Development of new oral anticoagulants further simplifies acute-phase treatment and 2 oral agents can be used as monotherapy, avoiding the need for LMWH. Patients with PE can also be treated in the acute phase as outpatients, a decision dependent on prognosis and severity of PE. Thrombolysis is best reserved for severe VTE; inferior vena cava filters, ideally the retrievable variety, should be used when anticoagulation is contraindicated. In general, DVT and PE patients require 3 months of treatment with anticoagulants, with options including LMWH, vitamin K antagonists, or direct factor Xa or direct factor IIa inhibitors. After this time, decisions for further treatment are based on balancing the risk of VTE recurrence, determined by etiology of the VTE (transient risk factors, unprovoked or malignancy associated), against the risk of major hemorrhage from treatment. Better prediction tools for major hemorrhage are needed. Experience with new oral anticoagulants as acute, long-term, and extended therapy options is limited as yet, but as a class they appear to be safe and effective for all phases of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mainstay of VTE treatment is anticoagulation, while interventions such as thrombolysis and inferior vena cava filters are reserved for limited circumstances. Multiple therapeutic modes and options exist for VTE treatment with small but nonetheless important differential effects to consider. Anticoagulants will probably always increase bleeding risk, necessitating tailored treatment strategies that must incorporate etiology, risk, benefit, cost, and patient preference. Although great progress has been made, further study to understand individual patient risks is needed to make ideal treatment decisions.

During long-term anticoagulation, drug tolerance, drug-drug interactions, blood pressure, renal function and adherence to treatment need to be assessed on a regular basis (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding) to optimize both the efficacy and safety of the treatment. Moreover, emerging modifiable risk factors for bleeding should be reversed and the appropriateness of continued anticoagulation evaluated following expert judgement and considering the patient's preference. A drastic transition between bleeding risk classes may provide justification for (temporarily) discontinuing treatment.

### Anticoagulation for three versus six months in patients with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both: randomised trial [^45545391]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimum duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after an episode of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both.

Design

Multicentre, prospective, randomised study with follow-up for one year.

Setting

46 hospitals in United Kingdom.

Participants

Patients aged ≥ 18 with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both.

Interventions

Three (n = 369) or six months (n = 380) of anticoagulation with heparin for five days accompanied and followed by warfarin, with a target international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.5.

Main Outcome Measures

Death from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; failure to resolve, extension, recurrence of during treatment; recurrence after treatment; and major haemorrhage during treatment.

Results

In the patients allocated to three months' treatment two died from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during or after treatment, compared with three in the six month group. During treatment deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism failed to resolve, extended, or recurred in six patients in the three month group without fatal consequences, compared with 10 in the six month group. After treatment there were 23 non-fatal recurrences in the three month group and 16 in the six month group. Fatal and non-fatal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during treatment, and after treatment thus occurred in 31(8%) of those who had received three months' anticoagulation compared with 29 (8%) of those who had received six months' (P = 0.80, 95% confidence interval for difference -3.1% to 4.7%). There were no fatal haemorrhages during treatment but there were eight major haemorrhages in those treated for six months and none in those treated for three months (P = 0.008, -3.5% to -0.7%). Thus 31 (8%) of the patients receiving three months' anticoagulation experienced adverse outcomes as a result of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or its treatment compared with 35 (9%) of those receiving six months' (P = 0.79, -4.9% to 3.2%).

Conclusion

For patients in the UK with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and no known risk factors for recurrence, there seems to be little, if any, advantage in increasing the duration of anticoagulation from three to six months. Any possible advantage would be small and would need to be judged against the increased risk of haemorrhage associated with the longer duration of treatment with warfarin.

Emergency physicians must be prepared to rapidly diagnose and resuscitate patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain aspects of PE resuscitation run counter to typical approaches. A specific understanding of the pathophysiology of PE is required to avoid cardiovascular collapse potentially associated with excessive intravenous fluids and positive pressure ventilation. Once PE is diagnosed, rapid risk stratification should be performed and treatment guided by patient risk class. Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of PE treatment, emergency physicians also must understand the indications and contraindications for thrombolysis and should be aware of new therapies and models of care that may improve outcomes.

### Factors in initial anticoagulation choice in hospitalized patients with pulmonary embolism [^67f611fa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in North America and Europe is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 persons. Patients are most commonly diagnosed with PE in the emergency department (ED), and the majority of US patients with PE are hospitalized. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment, including unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Of these treatments, UFH is the most labor intensive and carries the greatest risks despite being no more effective than the alternatives. In particular, its variable half-life, 2-phased elimination, and extensive binding to plasma proteins result in unpredictable pharmacokinetics that require nursing- or pharmacist-intensive protocols for laboratory monitoring. Despite monitoring, only 26% of patients with acute PE anticoagulated with UFH have been shown to be within the therapeutic range at 24 hours. Other studies have demonstrated an increased risk of bleeding with UFH. For these reasons, professional society guidelines recommend the use of LMWH or DOACs as the initial anticoagulation for patients with acute PE, unless a specific contraindication exists. Despite established guidelines, recent studies demonstrate increasing use of UFH in hospitalized patients with acute PE in the US. This qualitative study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators of guideline-concordant anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with acute PE.

1 Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical medical condition characterized by the sudden blockage of a major blood vessel in the lung, usually caused by a blood clot. PE is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its management is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The clinical presentation of PE can vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden death. The severity of PE is often categorized based on the patient's hemodynamic stability and the extent of the clot burden, leading to classifications such as sub‐massive and massive PE.

In sub‐massive pulmonary embolism (sPE), patients are hemodynamically stable but exhibit right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis. Acute intermediate‐risk PE, on the other hand, includes patients with signs of right ventricular dysfunction but without hypotension.

Exclusion or identification of right ventricular strain in hemodynamically stable patients with PE is a component of the risk stratification that directs additional therapy ("intermediate care", normal ward, outpatient treatment). Echocardiography can also identify significant concomitant conditions and help identify symptoms of a preexisting chronic cor pulmonale. Thus, even in patients with stable PE, echocardiography needs to be a standard technique, even though current recommendations do not require it.

The management of PE has evolved significantly over the years, with anticoagulation therapy being the cornerstone of treatment. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin help prevent further clot formation and facilitate clot resolution. However, anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient for all patients, particularly those with extensive clot burden or right ventricular dysfunction. In such cases, more aggressive interventions, including thrombolysis and catheter‐directed therapies, may be considered. Although prolonged treatment is related to a decreased chance of recurrence, it is also associated with a higher risk of bleeding. This is the reason why the length of oral anticoagulation is a more contentious argument. Oral anticoagulant medication should be administered for a minimum of 3 months to every patient. The selection of candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation should be based on the stratification of the risk of recurrence, which has been estimated to be approximately 2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk factors and 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the absence of transient risk factors or in patients with cancer or thrombophilia. This information ought to be taken into consideration when selecting candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation.

### Evidence-based anticoagulation choice for acute pulmonary embolism… [^114666d0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation is the foundation of treatment for most patients with pulmonary embolism. Guidelines recommend that most patients hospitalized for acute PE who are treated with parenteral anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight heparin rather than unfractionated heparin because LMWH achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more quickly and is associated with fewer bleeding complications. 1–3. Among the authors' conclusions were that emergency and hospitalist physicians share misconceptions regarding anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapies for PE. 5 Here, we address several of these crucial misunderstandings and the imperative to update these practices. Heparin revolutionized the care of thromboembolic disease when it was first introduced to clinical care in the late 1930s, yet it is far from perfect.

The action of UFH is affected by extensive binding to plasma proteins and vascular endothelial cells; minor UFH dose changes can produce dramatic swings in the intensity of anticoagulation due to its nonlinear and dose-dependent elimination. To achieve therapeutic anticoagulation for PE, the patient must reach a target activated partial thromboplastin time or anti–factor Xa level. The belief that UFH leads to immediate therapeutic anticoagulation is contrary to published evidence. One study demonstrated that more than 75% of patients receiving UFH do not have a single therapeutic APTT within 12 hours of starting treatment, and more than 40% do not have a therapeutic level within 48 hours. 7 In contrast, LMWH typically reaches therapeutic levels 3 to 4 hours after administration.
6. Protamine achieves partial reversal of LMWH, and guidelines recommend protamine for management of life-threatening bleeding associated with either UFH or LMWH.

2 DOACs may be reversed with prothrombin complex concentrates or specific reversal agents. The findings in the Stubblefield et al5 study suggest widespread misunderstanding of the pharmacology and guideline-recommended use of heparins in acute PE. Addressing these misconceptions and changing clinical practice will require a multifaceted approach, including pragmatic trials of anticoagulation effectiveness and safety in clinical settings, targeted educational programs from professional societies, and adoption of evidence-based policies by institutional quality committees. Ongoing emergency care research using implementation science frameworks should be conducted to modernize anticoagulation choices and improve outcomes for patients with PE.

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^1dc9432a]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^4d01b22b]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Despite improved management of concomitant heparin infusion, a closer surveillance of haemostasis, an increased knowledge in the risk factors for bleeding and finally, a better selection of patients who may benefit from thrombolysis, the incidence of bleeding is still high in modern trials. Moreover, some registries of unselected patients have also reported higher rates of major bleeding. In 304 patients from the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry who received fibrinolysis, 66 (21.7%) had major bleeding and 9 (3%) had ICH. Moreover, the rates of major bleeding associated with heparin infusion alone in the same registry were around 15%. Additional data from a tertiary centre in Paris showed that, of 132 patients receiving thrombolysis, 33 (25%) experienced major bleeding.

To date, only one RCT tested the use of thrombolysis in PE with cardiogenic shock. Four patients were enrolled in each arm, and the study was prematurely terminated after a marked statistical difference in mortality in favour of thrombolysis (0% in the thrombolysis group vs 100% in the heparin group, P = 0.02). Thrombolysis remains the standard of care for unstable PE with shock, and further confirmatory studies are unlikely to be conducted in this indication.

With regards to STEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is favoured over thrombolysis because of the improved combined outcomes of death, stroke and repeat MI. Infarct area size is likely greater in thrombolysis than with PCI. For every 1000 patients treated with PCI versus thrombolysis, 23 lives are saved, while 44 MI and 11 strokes are prevented. Moreover, patients treated with PCI have a decreased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Despite this, thrombolysis remains the standard of care for patients with STEMI who do not have access to a PCI-capable facility within 120 min of first medical contact. Of importance, patients receiving thrombolysis for STEMI also receive anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy, but the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage remains < 1%. Despite this, the incidence of bleeding associated with thrombolysis in PE is much higher than in MI. Table 1 summarises the results of 17 randomised studies of thrombolysis in PE and the reported events of major, fatal or intracranial bleeding.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism [^4fcb69c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the condition, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered. However, PE will only be confirmed in 10–20% of patients. Because the imaging test of choice, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is costly and associated with radiation exposure and other complications, a validated diagnostic algorithm consisting of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer test should be used to safely exclude PE in 20–30% of patients without the need for CTPA. Recently, the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has been validated, and this has increased the proportion of patients at older age in whom PE can be excluded without CTPA. Initial therapeutic management of PE depends on the risk of short-term PE-related mortality. Haemodynamically unstable patients should be closely monitored and receive thrombolytic therapy unless contraindicated because of an unacceptably high bleeding risk, whereas patients with low-risk PE may be safely discharged early from hospital or receive only outpatient treatment. The PESI score and Hestia decision rule are available to select patients in whom early discharge or outpatient treatment will be safe, although the safety of these strategies should be confirmed in additional studies. Standard PE therapy consists of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, several nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants have been shown to be as effective as LMWH/VKAs, and maybe safer. Determining the optimal duration of treatment for a first unprovoked PE remains a challenge, although clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation-associated haemorrhage are under investigation. Using these prediction rules may lead to both more standardized and more individualized long-term treatment of PE.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^cd004750]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

What is the optimal type and dose of thrombolytic agent and what should I do if a patient is already on low molecular weight heparin?

Thrombolytic agents for PE should be administered peripherally. Several thrombolytic agents have been studied: urokinase, streptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (alteplase, reteplase, desmoteplase and tenecteplase). Alteplase is the most widely used thrombolytic agent for PE; recommended dosing in patients ≥ 65 kg is a loading bolus of 10 mg over 1–2 min followed by 90 mg infused over 2 h. In patients < 65 kg the total dose administered is 1.5 mg/kg; for example a patient weighing 60 kg should receive a 10 mg loading bolus followed by 80 mg over 2 h. In patients already receiving intravenous heparin we stop the infusion prior to administration of alteplase, check activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 2 h following completion of administration and restart heparin when the APTT ratio is < 2× the upper limit of normal. If there is good clinical response to thrombolysis we would convert to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 24 h following thrombolysis. If therapeutic LMWH had been administered prior to thrombolysis we would usually start heparin infusion as above but delay commencement to 18 h following the last dose of LMWH if once-daily dosing and 8–10 h if twice-daily dosing had been used. Two RCTs have investigated the efficacy and side effects of half-dose alteplase in predominantly submassive PE. Superior efficacy with no increase in bleeding risk was observed when compared with anticoagulation alone, and equal efficacy with less haemorrhage was seen when compared with standard-dose anticoagulation.

Suggested approach: If thrombolysis is indicated for PE we would administer a 10 mg bolus of alteplase followed by a further 90 mg over 2 h (up to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg). If thrombolysis is indicated but there is a high risk of haemorrhage we would consider using a half-dose regimen.

### Early switch to oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PEITHO-2): a multinational, multicentre, single-arm, phase 4 trial [^af21091c]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend a risk-adjusted treatment strategy for the management of acute pulmonary embolism. This is a particular patient category for whom optimal treatment (anticoagulant treatment, reperfusion strategies, and duration of hospitalisation) is currently unknown. We investigated whether treatment of acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism with parenteral anticoagulation for a short period of 72 h, followed by a switch to a direct oral anticoagulant (dabigatran), is effective and safe.

Methods

We did a multinational, multicentre, single-arm, phase 4 trial at 42 hospitals in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with symptomatic intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism, with or without deep-vein thrombosis, were enrolled. Patients received parenteral low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin for 72 h after diagnosis of pulmonary embolism before switching to oral dabigatran 150 mg twice per day following a standard clinical assessment. The primary outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism-related death within 6 months. The primary and safety outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The study was terminated early, as advised by the data safety and monitoring board, following sample size adaptation after the predefined interim analysis on Dec 18, 2018. This trial is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2015-001830-12) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02596555).

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2016, and July 31, 2019, 1418 patients with pulmonary embolism were screened, of whom 402 were enrolled and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age was 69.5 years [IQR 60.0–78.0); 192 [48%] were women and 210 [52%] were men). Median follow-up was 217 days (IQR 210–224) and 370 (92%) patients adhered to the protocol. The primary outcome occurred in seven (2% [upper bound of right-sided 95% CI 3]; p < 0.0001 for rejecting the null hypothesis) patients, with all events occurring in those with intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism (seven [3%; upper bound of right-sided 95% CI 5] of 283). At 6 months, 11 (3% [95% CI 1–5]) of 402 patients had at least one major bleeding event and 16 (4% [2–6]) had at least one clinically relevant non-major bleeding event; the only fatal haemorrhage occurred in one (< 1%) patient before the switch to dabigatran.

Interpretation

A strategy of early switch from heparin to dabigatran following standard clinical assessment was effective and safe in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. Our results can help to refine guideline recommendations for the initial treatment of acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism, optimising the use of resources and avoiding extended hospitalisation.

Heparin dosing strategies and early anticoagulation — In one comparison with identical total dosing (an IV bolus of 5,000 units and 30,000 units per day) using subcutaneous 15,000 units every 12 h vs continuous IV infusion of 30,000 units per day, patients assigned to IV heparin had a significantly lower rate of recurrence than those given subcutaneous heparin; in a randomized trial, fixed dosing (5,000-unit bolus followed by 1,000 units/h infusion) vs weight-based nomogram dosing (starting dose, 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/h by infusion) showed that patients whose heparin was weight-adjusted received higher doses within the first 24 h and the rate of recurrent thromboembolism was significantly lower with the weight-adjusted regimen; in a study of 400 consecutive patients with acute pulmonary embolism, patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT in < 24 h had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates than those who did not.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^6fefa190]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and may reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhage. This is the third update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 16 April 2018. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy followed by heparin versus heparin alone, heparin plus placebo, or surgical intervention for patients with acute PE. We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JY, QH) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data. We calculated effect estimates using the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) or the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified no new studies for inclusion in this 2018 update. We included in the review 18 trials with a total of 2197 participants. We were not able to include one study in the meta-analysis because it provided no data that we could extract. Most of the studies carried a high risk of bias because of high or unclear risk related to randomisation and blinding. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with heparin alone, or heparin plus placebo, thrombolytics plus heparin can reduce the odds of death (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87, 2167 participants, P = 0.01, low-quality evidence) and recurrence of PE (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89, 1898 participants, P = 0.02, low-quality evidence). Effects on mortality weakened when we excluded from analysis four studies at high risk of bias (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06, 2054 participants, P = 0.08). The incidence of major and minor haemorrhagic events was higher in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.31, 1897 participants, P < 0.001, low-quality evidence; OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.58 to 6.06, 1553 participants, P = 0.001, very low-quality evidence, respectively). We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low or very low because of design limitations, potential influence of pharmaceutical companies, and small sample sizes. Length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -0.89, 95% CI -3.13 to 1.34) and quality of life were similar between the two treatment groups. Limited information from a small number of trials indicated that thrombolytics may improve haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment, echocardiograms, pulmonary hypertension, coagulation parameters, clinical outcomes, and survival time to a greater extent than heparin alone. However, the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of participants involved warrant caution when results are interpreted. Similarily, fewer participants from the thrombolytics group required escalation of treatment. None of the included studies reported on post-thrombotic syndrome or compared the costs of different treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that thrombolytics reduce death following acute pulmonary embolism compared with heparin. The included studies used a variety of thrombolytic drugs. Thrombolytic therapy may be helpful in reducing the recurrence of pulmonary emboli but may cause major and minor haemorrhagic events and stroke. More high-quality, blinded randomised controlled trials assessing safety and cost-effectiveness of therapies for pulmonary embolism are required.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^f036142a]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

A patient with a recent acute PE fails to respond to initial therapy: what should I do?

If a patient with acute PE fails to respond to initial anticoagulation, with worsening cardiovascular instability and/or respiratory failure, then thrombolysis should be considered. In the MAPPET-3 study of submassive PE, delayed thrombolysis was performed in 23% of patients treated initially with heparin, with no difference in mortality compared with patients receiving up-front thrombolysis. Although reperfusion is greater the earlier thrombolysis is given, benefit may be observed when administered up to 14 days from symptom onset. Failure to improve following thrombolysis may be related to persistent thrombus, complications such as lung infarction or infection or existence of chronic clot. Reassessment with additional imaging may therefore be required. In the presence of persistent clot, repeat thrombolysis or mechanical therapy may be considered. A single centre retrospective study of treatment in failed thrombolysis demonstrated that mortality in patients receiving repeat thrombolysis was 38% compared with 7% in patients undergoing embolectomy, although bias in management approach cannot be excluded. Supportive therapy for lung infarction may include ventilatory support, treatment of superadded infection and inotropic support. If underlying chronic thromboembolic disease is suspected, referral for pulmonary endartectomy and the use of bridging pulmonary vasodilator therapy should be considered. The role of pulmonary vasodilators in purely acute disease has also been assessed. Inhaled nitric oxide may improve gas exchange in acute PE. Limited data suggest possible benefit from nebulised iloprostwhile a small RCT failed to demonstrate benefit from intravenous eposprostenol. There are limited reports of benefit from sildenafil in animal models and humans with acute PE.

Suggested approach: Thrombolysis should be considered when a patient initially treated with anticoagulation alone develops worsening cardiovascular instability or respiratory failure. Failure to improve following thrombolysis should trigger reassessment for residual clot or complication of PE. Surgical embolectomy is preferable to re-thrombolysis for persistent obstructing acute PE.

### Treatment and management of acute venous thromboembolic disease [^538f566e]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease consists of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Either low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously or unfractionated heparin administered intravenously are used for the initial treatment. Simultaneously, warfarin therapy is initiated. Thrombolytic therapy plays a limited role. Following the initial heparin treatment, anticoagulation clinics provide an excellent means of monitoring the oral anticoagulation. Patient education is important and patients should be well versed in the basic features of oral anticoagulation. The duration of oral anticoagulation is dependent on a number of factors including the presence of inherited risk factors, bleeding risk and patient reliability. Residual thrombus in the affected vein may indicate the need for prolonged anticoagulation. The low intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 1.5–2.0) is useful in preventing recurrent thrombosis following the initial treatment period with full intensity oral anticoagulation.

TREATMENT

Patients with PE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as possible, barring contraindications. Options for initial anticoagulation include unfractionated heparin (UH) (e.g. 80 U/kg as an initial bolus followed by 18 U/kg/hour continuous infusion), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ BID) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. apixaban 10 mg PO BID or rivaroxaban 15 mg PO BID). There is growing evidence that UH is associated with delayed therapeutic anticoagulation.LMWH and DOACs are more likely than UH to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 h, with simpler dosing. Despite these benefits, UH is still used regularly.

The benefit of anticoagulation, and the choice of anticoagulant, must be considered alongside the risk of bleeding. As a class, DOACs are associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage than heparin and warfarin. While scores like HAS‐BLEDare useful in assessing bleeding risk associated with long‐term anticoagulation, there are no validated scores that assess short‐term bleeding risk and guide initial therapy. In general, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not remove the need for anticoagulation, but for patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, IVC filter placement may be considered. IVC filters are thrombogenic over time and should be removed as soon as clinically possible.

Advanced therapy is often indicated for haemodynamically unstable patients with PE, and some with RV dysfunction. Critically ill patients with PE are increasingly being evaluated by multidisciplinary PE response teams (PERTs)that facilitate rapid evaluation and treatment. Systemic thrombolysis is typically reserved for patients with haemodynamic instability that prevents alternative therapies. Catheter‐directed therapy (CDT), including thrombolysis or embolectomy, can be considered for high‐risk patients in lieu of systemic thrombolysis, or for patients for whom systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated. If available, patients with haemodynamic instability may be temporized with veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) prior to definitive treatment. However, evidence supporting CDT (Class 2a, Level C) and ECMO (Class 2b, Level C) is limited.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^10fa1445]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PE management is challenging in many ways starting with, at times, deceptive clinical presentations. Thus, a decompensating patient may seem compensated but present with a life-threatening RV dysfunction. The same high-risk patient with PE may be treated completely differently depending on concomitant factors such as age, context and local resources. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach should be attempted, for example, a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT), to best manage patients with acute, severe disease. This shift of approach should to be adjusted according to the usefulness and timing of the intervention; in particular, PE management needs to be tailored to pathophysiology.

Acute cor pulmonale due to PE has a very specific pathophysiology, where patient characteristics and haemodynamic features interact, and may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding following thrombolysis. Future challenges to decrease the bleeding risk and improve clinical outcomes include better bleeding risk stratification, tailored heparin and thrombolysis dosage, improved treatment monitoring, adjunctive catheter-based therapies and implementing multidisciplinary PERTs.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^8664391e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the main manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) besides deep venous thrombosis. It is associated with relatively high morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is also regarded as a chronic illness since it recurs frequently. For patients with acute PE or a first episode of PE, treatment with oral anticoagulants (OA) for a period of 3 or 6 months is highly recommended by several authoritative guidelines. Nevertheless, after the completion of the 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation with OA, whether or how the following extended treatment is going to proceed is nuanced. Extended OA treatment also known as secondary thromboprophylaxis is oftentimes recommended for patients with acute PE at high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding.

In an observational cohort study of patients with PE who survived an initial phase of 3–6 months anticoagulation, over a mean follow-up duration of 2.1 ± 0.3 years, the adjusted rate of the all-cause death or recurrent VTE was 2.1% in the extended and 7.7% in the non-extended anticoagulant groups, for patients treated with extended anticoagulant therapy (p < 0.001). The rate of bleeding was similar between two groups. Extended OA over 2.5 years after index PE provides a net clinical benefit, compared with no anticoagulation in PE patients being selected to receive extended anticoagulation.

Nevertheless, the role of length of OA treatment in long-term outcome such as 5 years after OA discontinuation has been understudied to date, despite it has been already recognised that extended OA use is more beneficial than no extended OA use, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis. The optimal length of OA use for the maximum benefit within 5 years after OA discontinuation in patients with acute PE requiring secondary thromboprophylaxis has been undefined by far. Consequently, the current study was performed to investigate this subject.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^4f261288]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The results of the current study may yield some clinical implications for clinicians. First, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis, it is recommended to use OA for more than 2 years in order to reduce long-term PE-related mortality, although it is futile for the improvement of all-cause mortality. Second, overall OA use for 2 to 3 years after PE diagnosis may be the optimal length to acquire long-term low incidence of VTE recurrence, an acceptable bleeding rates and the best net clinical benefit, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis. Third, unfortunately, the cumulative risk of bleeding increases gradually along with the gradual elongation of length of OA use. It is not recommended to use OA for more than 3 years due to the possibly high bleeding risk and inferior net clinical benefit. Of note, notwithstanding the results of the current study suggested that 2 to 3 years of OA use is the optimal length for an outcome 5 years after OA discontinuation in patients with acute PE who require extended anticoagulation, whether the results still hold true longer than 5 years after OA discontinuation is unclear. In addition, due to the inconsiderable number of patients who underwent OA use for more than 3 years, this patient population was not subdivided according to the specific length of OA use. As such, the relationship is unknown between the specific length of OA use in patients who underwent OA use for more than 3 years and the 5-year outcomes after OA discontinuation. Nevertheless, the benefit of an overall OA use for 2–3 years is at least non-inferior to an OA use for more than 3 years with respect to outcomes by and large. Taking into account of the increasing bleeding risk along with the gradual extension of OA use, the OA use for 2 to 3 years should be preferred than that for more than 3 years. Finally, despite a general length of 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation is defined for acute PE patients, it does not mean that they have to neither more nor less undergo 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation without any variation, due to unpredictable change of risk factors for thrombosis or bleeding. OA may be prematurely terminated due to major bleeding or proceed owing to unsolved risk factors for thrombosis. Likewise, the same applies to PE patients requiring secondary thromboprophylaxis. Being similar to the initial 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation for acute PE, the 2–3 years of anticoagulation for secondary thromboprophylaxis is also a general recommendation.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^dba6bced]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1b2f89b4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

### Outpatient treatment of patients with deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [^c86333c4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There have been a large number of randomized trials comparing standard unfractionated intravenous heparin with low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of deep-vein thrombosis, but only two of these have looked at outpatient therapy. There have been only two randomized trials including patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and neither of these provided outpatient therapy. Postmortem and clinical studies have shown a strong association between pulmonary embolism and the presence of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs. Based on similar rates of venous thromboembolic recurrence and death, these studies suggest that initial treatment should be the same for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The feasibility of providing outpatient care to many patients seeking treatment for deep-vein thrombosis or acute pulmonary embolism at certain tertiary care hospitals has become evident, but the data suggest that the proportion of eligible patients is institution dependent and may vary from 18% to 91%. In the author's institution, approximately 50% of patients with pulmonary embolism could be treated as outpatients, but there have been no other reports on outpatient therapy for patients with pulmonary embolism. If patients with pulmonary embolism meet criteria demonstrated to result in a higher risk of death, it is, of course, reasonable to not treat such patients on an outpatient basis. Low-molecular-weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulant therapy provides adequate therapy in most patients with deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and many patients can be treated as outpatients.

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^efc160e1]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Plugging the gaps: catheter-based interventions in elderly patients presenting with pulmonary embolism [^01fb07fa]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The first is systemic thrombolysis, either at "full dose", typically 100 mg of alteplase over 2 hours for an adult of median body weight, or at half dose, with the aim of minimizing bleeding complications. The data that doing so avoids bleeding while maintaining efficacy are limited, and the basic principle is open to question — to bleed, one must have a potential bleeding source, in which case why would 50 mg of alteplase be substantially less likely to cause bleeding than 100 mg? It might, though, and the ongoing PEITHO 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining "half dose" lytic against anticoagulation in intermediate-risk PE will help to clarify this.

The conundrum of bleeding vs reperfusion goes through the minds of front-line clinicians regularly, leading to a substantial withholding of what should be considered life-saving thrombolysis for high-risk PE. Why would this occur when, without reperfusion, the mortality for high-risk PE may be over 50%?. A psychologist might say that, when reperfusion therapy is withheld, the disease is responsible for the outcome, whereas a therapy delivered that causes death by intracranial hemmorhage is thought by some to have died at the hands of the decision-maker. This has left clinicians in a situation whereby more than half of all patients with high-risk PE are treated only with heparin ± vasopressor/inotropic support, leaving a major gap in treatment for the sickest patients with PE. Surgical thrombectomy, involving cardiopulmonary bypass, has had many decades to fill this gap, but only a small minority are treated with this strategy.

Secondly, this gap has increasingly been filled with catheter-based therapies (CBTs). One example is catheter-based thrombolysis, with lower doses of lytic delivered directly into the pulmonary arteries in the hope of maintaining efficacy at decreased bleeding risk. The theory is that smaller thrombolytic doses are immediately taken up by the clot and may result in lower circulating concentrations of lytic, especially given protocols incorporating doses as low as 8 to 12 mg of alteplase. However, there remain 2 concerns with catheter lysis for high-risk PE. First, to leverage the theoretical lower risks of bleeding from catheter lysis, response time may be delayed and leave patients waiting in a potentially deadly hemodynamic spiral of shock. Secondly, the bleeding concerns remain, albeit at a magnitude smaller compared with systemic lytics.

### Early anticoagulation is associated with reduced mortality for acute pulmonary embolism [^261fcc5b]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) may be rapidly fatal if not diagnosed and treated. IV heparin reduces mortality and recurrence of PE, but the relationship between survival and timing of anticoagulation has not been extensively studied.

Methods

We studied 400 consecutive patients in the ED diagnosed with acute PE by CT scan angiography and treated in the hospital with IV unfractionated heparin from 2002 to 2005. Patients received heparin either in the ED or after admission. Time from ED arrival to therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was calculated. Outcomes included in-hospital and 30-day mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, hemorrhagic events on heparin, and recurrent venous thromboembolism within 90 days.

Results

In-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 3.0% and 7.7%, respectively. Patients who received heparin in the ED had lower in-hospital (1.4% vs 6.7%; P = 0.009) and 30-day (4.4% vs 15.3%; P < .001) mortality rates as compared with patients given heparin after admission. Patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT within 24 h had lower in-hospital (1.5% vs 5.6%; P = 0.093) and 30-day (5.6% vs 14.8%; P = 0.037) mortality rates as compared with patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT after 24 h. In multiple logistic regression models, receiving heparin in the ED remained predictive of reduced mortality, and ICU admission remained predictive of increased mortality.

Conclusions

We report an association between early anticoagulation and reduced mortality for patients with acute PE. We advocate further study with regard to comorbidities to assess the usefulness of modifications to hospital protocols.

### Influence of preceding length of anticoagulant treatment and initial presentation of venous thromboembolism on risk of recurrence after stopping treatment: analysis of individual participants' data from seven trials [^ce09db17]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism, which encompasses deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is usually treated with a short course of a parenteral heparin, followed by a longer course of oral vitamin K antagonist treatment. The decision to continue anticoagulant treatment beyond the first few months is based on the treating physician's perception of the benefits and harms of continuing treatment and on the patient's preference. The benefits and harms associated with different lengths of vitamin K antagonist treatment have been evaluated in several studies that randomly allocated patients with venous thromboembolism to receive different lengths of treatment. Three clear messages have emerged from the findings of these studies. Firstly, in unselected patients with venous thromboembolism, shortening the length of treatment from three or six months to 1.0 or 1.5 months results in a substantial increase in the frequency of recurrent thromboembolism after anticoagulants are stopped. Secondly, vitamin K antagonist treatment targeted to an international normalised ratio of 2.5 is very effective at preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism. Thirdly, the risk of recurrent thromboembolism increases after vitamin K antagonist treatment is stopped. However, the results of these individual trials, and meta-analysis of summary data of their findings, have failed to answer many important questions relating to the optimal length of vitamin K antagonist treatment for venous thromboembolism.

The most important limitation of individual studies that have evaluated the optimal length of vitamin K antagonist treatment for venous thromboembolism is that they only compared two lengths of treatment. Consequently, although studies could identify which of two lengths of treatment was superior, no study was in a position to determine if the superior length of treatment was also the optimal length of treatment; perhaps a third length of treatment would result in even better clinical outcomes. Another limitation of individual studies is that they included insufficient numbers of patients in subgroups to be able to determine if the main findings of each study applied to all patients. For example, if clinical features identify a sub-population of patients with venous thromboembolism who have a substantially lower risk of recurrent thrombosis after vitamin K antagonist treatment is stopped, such patients might benefit from a shorter duration of treatment.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism (PE) — evidence update: AT9 recommendations for thrombolytic therapy were based on low-quality evidence, with only about 800 randomized patients and very imprecise estimates; trials had a high risk of bias with strong suspicion of selective reporting favoring thrombolysis. Since AT9, two additional small randomized trials and a much larger trial have evaluated systemic thrombolysis in about 1,200 patients, increasing the quality of evidence from low to moderate. The Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis trial randomized 1,006 patients with PE and right ventricular dysfunction to tenecteplase and heparin or to heparin therapy alone (with placebo) and found that thrombolytic therapy prevented cardiovascular collapse but increased major (including intracranial) bleeding, with benefits and harms finely balanced and no convincing net benefit; "rescue thrombolytic therapy" appeared to benefit patients who developed cardiovascular collapse after initial anticoagulant therapy. The guideline notes that "The improved quality of evidence has not resulted in substantial changes to our recommendations".

### Thrombolysis compared with heparin for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials [^5533bf8c]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials and meta-analyses have reached conflicting conclusions about the role of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta-analysis of all randomized trials comparing thrombolytic therapy with heparin in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Eleven trials, involving 748 patients, were included. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death (6.7% versus 9.6%; OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.12, P for heterogeneity = 0.48), a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding (9.1% versus 6.1%; OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.46), and a significant increase in nonmajor bleeding (22.7% versus 10.0%; OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.54; number needed to harm = 8). Thrombolytic therapy compared with heparin was associated with a significant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death in trials that also enrolled patients with major (hemodynamically unstable) pulmonary embolism (9.4% versus 19.0%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92; number needed to treat = 10) but not in trials that excluded these patients (5.3% versus 4.8%; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.30), with significant heterogeneity between these 2 groups of trials (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Currently available data provide no evidence for a benefit of thrombolytic therapy compared with heparin for the initial treatment of unselected patients with acute pulmonary embolism. A benefit is suggested in those at highest risk of recurrence or death. The number of patients enrolled in randomized trials to date is modest, and further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism appears warranted.

### Six months vs extended oral anticoagulation after a first episode of pulmonary embolism: the PADIS-PE randomized clinical trial [^061f9740]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of an additional 18-month treatment with warfarin vs placebo, after an initial 6-month nonrandomized treatment period on a vitamin K antagonist.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind trial (treatment period, 18 months; median follow-up, 24 months); 371 adult patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism (ie, with no major risk factor for thrombosis) and had been treated initially for 6 uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist were randomized and followed up between July 2007 and September 2014 in 14 French centers.

Interventions

Warfarin or placebo for 18 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding at 18 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the composite at 42 months (treatment period plus 24-month follow-up), as well as each component of the composite, and death unrelated to pulmonary embolism or major bleeding, at 18 and 42 months.

Results

After randomization, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, all after month 18, and 1 withdrew due to an adverse event. During the 18-month treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in 6 of 184 patients (3.3%) in the warfarin group and in 25 of 187 (13.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09–0.55; P = 0.001). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 patients in the warfarin group and 25 patients in the placebo group (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.43); major bleeding occurred in 4 patients in the warfarin group and in 1 patient in the placebo group (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.44 to 35.89). During the 42-month entire study period (including the study treatment and follow-up periods), the composite outcome occurred in 33 patients (20.8%) in the warfarin group and in 42 (24.0%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47–1.18). Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and unrelated death did not differ between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^f72e4aba]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism stability and outpatient management — most patients are stable at presentation and low-risk cohorts have low adverse event rates with traditional anticoagulation. "More than 95% of patients who ultimately receive a diagnosis of acute PE are 'hemodynamically stable' at presentation with an associated mortality of 1% to 15%". "More recently, NOACs (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) have been approved for the treatment of both DVT and PE after studies demonstrated that this regimen was noninferior to traditional treatment with heparin and a VKA". "Two randomized controlled trials were identified that assessed outcomes of low-risk patients admitted to the hospital and treated with traditional anticoagulation for 90 days". "In these 2 studies, the incidence of recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality was approximately 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively". Accordingly, "an outpatient treatment strategy for newly diagnosed PE can be deemed safe and effective if the subsequent incidence of important adverse outcomes does not exceed those experienced by patients receiving traditional hospitalization followed by outpatient care".

### Interventional therapies for acute pulmonary embolism [^956278dd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist in outcome data around many interventional therapies, a fact that is reflected in the low strength of management recommendations found in consensus major society guidelines. In addition to careful risk stratification, therapeutic anticoagulation generally should be an early part of PE management in all cases. For patients presenting with acute high-risk PE or intermediate-risk PE with higher risk features, consideration should be given to systemic thrombolysis after careful evaluation for potential bleeding complications. In patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of this therapy, or significant ongoing cardiopulmonary distress, consideration should be given to interventional therapies like catheter-directed lysis, catheter-directed embolectomy, surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support. Until more robust comparative outcome data are put forward, pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) should be considered for multi-disciplinary patient evaluation and management.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^004f0331]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can migrate from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, to the lungs. Conventional treatment of PE used unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. DOACs have characteristics that may be favourable to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. This review reports the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment of PE (minimum duration of three months). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of PE.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 March 2022. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a PE confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with a conventional anticoagulant or compared with each other for the long-term treatment of PE (minimum duration three months).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent PE, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and health-related quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified five additional RCTs with 1484 participants for this update. Together with the previously included trials, we have included ten RCTs with a total of 13,073 participants. Two studies investigated an oral DTI (dabigatran) and eight studies investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (three rivaroxaban, three apixaban, and two edoxaban). The studies were of good methodological quality overall. Meta-analysis showed no clear difference in the efficacy and safety of oral DTI compared with conventional anticoagulation in preventing recurrent PE (odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.04; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.66; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), DVT (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.13; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and major bleeding (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.68; 2 studies, 1527 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for imprecision due to the low number of events. There was also no clear difference between the oral factor Xa inhibitors and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent PE (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.29; 3 studies, 8186 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 8 studies, 11,416 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), DVT (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25; 2 studies, 8151 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.70; 1 study, 4817 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.41; 8 studies, 11,447 participants; low-certainty evidence); the heterogeneity for major bleeding was significant (I 2 = 79%). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate and low because of imprecision due to the low number of events and inconsistency due to clinical heterogeneity. None of the included studies measured health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence shows there is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent PE, recurrent VTE, DVT, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. The certainty of evidence was moderate or low. Future large clinical trials are required to identify if individual drugs differ in effectiveness and bleeding risk, and to explore effect differences in subgroups, including people with cancer and obesity.

### Physician practices in the treatment of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis… [^0ed2d2aa]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- To quantify physican practices in the care of patients with presumed pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, we analyzed heparin sodium orders, the intensity of anticoagulation, and complications in 65 patients with the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. All patients were given heparin, for a mean period of 8. 8 ±
0. 4 days. A high percentage of patients did not have a single partial thromboplastin time greater than 1. 5 times control within the first 24 hours of heparin therapy. Not until day 8 were 90% of PTTs in therapeutic range. We Identified five common practices that led to delays in achieving a PTT greater than 1. 5 times the laboratory control: failure to start heparin therapy at the time of initial clinical suspicion, choice of a heparin sodium bolus and continuous infusion insufficient to elevate the PTT to greater than

5 times control, delay in obtaining the first PTT, insufficient heparin dosing in response to a low PTT, and excessive and prolonged reductions in heparin therapy in response to a PTT greater than three times control, leading to subtherapeutic levels in 56% of subsequent PTTs. We think that poor understanding of heparin kinetics, overcautious behavior of physicians, and high heparin requirements in this selected population account for the findings.

Recommendations for transitioning from therapy with heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin preparation to therapy with an oral anticoagulant in patients with acute venous or arterial thromboembolism have undergone several changes during the last two decades. Physicians are now comfortable with beginning treatment with an oral anticoagulant once the diagnosis is confirmed, and loading doses are no longer considered to be necessary. Exceptions to early transition may be necessary in patients with an extensive iliofemoral or axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism where thrombolytic agents may be indicated, or in individuals who require surgery or other invasive procedures, or if there are concerns about bleeding. The avoidance of early transition to oral anticoagulants in patients with acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia also has been advised because of the potential for further thrombotic complications, including venous limb gangrene and warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

### Optimal follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society [^b68c6157]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that some sporting or other leisure activities are associated with direct bodily contact or prone to trauma, and as such of major bleeding. Such activities should generally be avoided for the duration of anticoagulant therapy, as has also been advised for patients with atrial fibrillation. Personalized anticoagulation schedules during the long-term anticoagulation phase may be discussed on an individual basis with high-level athletes. These may include consideration of occasional anticoagulation dose delays or omission prior to high-risk activities.

Long-haul air travel is associated with an increased risk of PE after discontinuation of anticoagulation. We propose the use of either compression stockings or prophylactic intensity anticoagulation in all patients with prior PE who have discontinued anticoagulant therapy and plan long-haul air flights (> 4 h). Twelve of the 16 panel members would prescribe a NOAC when it is decided to treat with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, while four preferred low molecular weight heparin. Fifteen of 16 panel members would start pharmacological thromboprophylaxis on the day of the flight rather than the day before, and 10 would extend the duration of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to 2–4 days following the flight in light of the increased risk of VTE that may persist for several days.
