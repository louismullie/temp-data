## Question

Does faith healing fully cure severe eczema or not

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether faith healing can fully cure severe eczema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "faith healing" encompasses and whether it has been studied for atopic dermatitis. Then, I should verify the disease course of atopic dermatitis and whether any therapy, conventional or complementary, achieves a durable cure. Next, I will review the evidence base for complementary and alternative modalities, including spiritual or prayer-based interventions, in eczema. After that, I should check authoritative guidelines for any recommendations or cautions about faith healing. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically sound, reference-supported conclusion and counseling points about expectations and safe, evidence-based care.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misclassify the intervention. Faith healing typically refers to prayer, spiritual healing, or similar practices intended to invoke divine intervention for cure; in healthcare literature, these are often grouped under complementary and alternative medicine or mind–body modalities, and they are distinct from conventional pharmacologic or procedural therapies, which already tells me the evidentiary bar will be different and likely lower for high-quality data [^2f84d5eb] [^ddd0fec6].

> Next, I should review the disease biology to anchor expectations. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease driven by barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation; importantly, there is no established cure, and management focuses on control rather than eradication, which sets a high bar for any claim of "full cure" from any modality, including faith healing [^cca28cce] [^cf7c5304].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether any randomized or controlled studies of faith healing for eczema exist. I systematically reviewed the provided sources and found no randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, or even case series evaluating prayer or spiritual healing as a treatment for atopic dermatitis, which means there is no direct clinical evidence to support efficacy, let alone a durable cure, from faith healing in this condition [^notfound].

> I will now examine the broader CAM evidence in eczema to see if anything analogous informs plausibility. Reviews of complementary therapies for atopic dermatitis consistently conclude that most modalities have insufficient or low-quality evidence, with small studies, methodological flaws, and inconsistent results; where signals exist, they are modest and not curative, reinforcing that the field lacks robust efficacy data for CAM, including mind–body or spiritual approaches, in eczema care [^9f4595cc] [^f9c85770] [^43ed18a3].

> Wait, let me verify what major guidelines say, because absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. Contemporary guidelines from AAAAI/ACAAI and the European ETFAD/EADV explicitly recommend against offering complementary or alternative medicine for atopic dermatitis due to lack of benefit and potential harms, and they do not list faith healing or prayer as recommended interventions; this aligns with the absence of supportive trials and supports a conclusion that faith healing should not be considered a treatment for eczema [^5701516a] [^70e79205] [^92c4d672].

> But wait, what if spiritual practices help indirectly via stress reduction or coping? I should double-check that angle. While stress and psychosocial factors can exacerbate atopic dermatitis, and educational or behavioral interventions may modestly improve adherence and quality of life, these effects are adjunctive and do not constitute disease cure; moreover, high-quality evidence for prayer or spiritual healing as a disease-modifying therapy in eczema is lacking, so any benefit would be speculative and should not replace evidence-based dermatologic care [^5a1a6308] [^06090a6e].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Based on the available evidence, there are no clinical studies demonstrating that faith healing cures severe atopic dermatitis, and major guidelines do not recommend it as a therapy; given the chronic, relapsing nature of eczema and the lack of curative modalities overall, it is not reasonable to expect that faith healing would fully cure severe eczema, although individuals may derive coping or placebo-related comfort that does not translate into disease remission [^cca28cce] [^5701516a] [^70e79205].

> I should confirm practical counseling points so the patient receives actionable guidance. I would explain that eczema is a long-term condition managed with trigger avoidance, daily emollients, and anti-inflammatory topicals, escalating to phototherapy or systemic agents for moderate-to-severe disease; I would also acknowledge the role of stress and psychosocial support, and if spiritual practices are important to the patient, I would frame them as adjuncts that may support coping, while emphasizing that they are not substitutes for evidence-based dermatologic treatment and should be integrated safely with conventional care [^cca28cce] [^a3a44057] [^9b500ea2].

Faith healing does not cure severe eczema. There is **no scientific evidence** that faith healing produces durable remission or cures atopic dermatitis, and it is not recommended by medical guidelines [^70e79205] [^92c4d672]. Severe eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a relapsing course [^e698e172]; current evidence-based care focuses on **control, not cure**, using topical anti-inflammatories, moisturizers, and, for refractory cases, systemic therapies [^b74d110f] [^d9e40110] [^cca28cce]. Faith healing may offer comfort or stress relief, but it should not replace standard dermatologic treatment, and patients should be counseled to continue evidence-based care [^9b500ea2].

---

## Scientific evidence regarding faith healing and eczema

- **Lack of clinical evidence**: There are no randomized controlled trials or rigorous clinical studies demonstrating that faith healing cures severe eczema.

- **Absence from guidelines**: Major dermatology guidelines (e.g. AAAAI/ACAAI, EADV/ETFAD) do not mention or recommend faith healing for eczema management [^5701516a] [^70e79205].

- **Placebo and psychological effects**: Any perceived benefits from faith healing are likely due to placebo effects, stress reduction, or improved coping, not disease modification [^notfound].

---

## Current medical understanding of severe eczema

Severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a **chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease** characterized by intense pruritus, skin barrier dysfunction, and immune dysregulation [^cf7c5304]. It is not considered curable; management focuses on **control of flares and maintenance of remission** [^cca28cce].

## Evidence-based treatments for severe eczema

| **Treatment category** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical therapies | - Topical corticosteroids <br/> - Calcineurin inhibitors <br/> - PDE-4 inhibitors <br/> - JAK inhibitors | High [^b74d110f] [^d9e40110] |
| Systemic therapies | - Dupilumab <br/> - Methotrexate <br/> - Azathioprine <br/> - Cyclosporine <br/> - Phototherapy | High [^c595d9ed] [^4ffe6e81] |
| Supportive care | - Moisturizers <br/> - Trigger avoidance <br/> - Patient education | High [^a3a44057] [^5a1a6308] |

## Potential risks and limitations of relying on faith healing

- **Delayed medical care**: Relying on faith healing can delay effective treatment, worsening disease and causing complications (e.g. infections, permanent skin changes).

- **False hope**: Promises of cure can lead to disappointment, psychological distress, and reduced adherence to proven therapies.

- **Ethical concerns**: Especially in children, exclusive reliance on faith healing may raise ethical and legal issues regarding medical neglect [^2f84d5eb].

---

## Psychological and emotional aspects of faith healing

Faith healing may provide **stress relief, coping, and emotional support**, which can modestly improve quality of life. However, these effects are **adjunctive and do not substitute for medical therapy**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **evidence-based therapies** and do not recommend faith healing for eczema. Shared decision-making should incorporate patient values, but **standard care remains foundational** [^dd66ed73] [^a3a44057].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Faith healing does not cure severe eczema. Patients should receive **evidence-based dermatologic care** and use faith practices only as adjuncts for comfort or coping. Clinicians should counsel patients on the chronic nature of eczema, the lack of curative evidence for faith healing, and the importance of adhering to proven therapies [^cca28cce].

### Efficacy of a 3% K ā nuka oil cream for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eczema: a single blind randomised vehicle-controlled trial [^0564e4d8]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing globally and is common in patients with eczema. However, there is often no evidence of efficacy or limited data from inadequately powered clinical trials. New Zealand (NZ) ranks high globally in terms of prevalence of eczema in both children and adolescents, with the indigenous peoples, Māori, disproportionately affected. Māori have traditionally used the kānuka tree (Kunzea ericoides) to treat disease, including using the exudate of the tree for inflammatory conditions, as part of a traditional healing system, Rongoā Māori. The kānuka tree is endemic to NZ and its oil extract, characterized by high levels of a-pinene and p-cymene, has demonstrable anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. These properties may confer prophylactic and therapeutic benefit for both the inflamed lesions and potential secondary infections. A study by Chen et al identified that kānuka oil significantly decreased the production of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by antigen presenting cells.TNF-α has been shown to stimulate the T helper 2 (Th2) cell and T helper 17 (Th17) cell inflammatory response, both of which are involved in the development of eczema lesions. In vivo, kānuka oil may reduce T-cell mediated inflammation in eczematous skin.

Given the widespread use of CAM, both in NZ and internationally, and the pre-clinical evidence for an anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effect for kānuka oil, there is an opportunity for a novel, steroid sparing, topical treatment for eczema. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigated the participant reported efficacy of kānuka oil in the topical treatment of moderate-to-severe eczema, through a nationwide community pharmacy based research network.

### Research techniques made simple: mouse models of atopic dermatitis [^458a19ec]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by impaired barrier function, eczematous dermatitis, and chronic pruritus. Mouse models have been heavily used to deepen our understanding of complicated disease mechanisms in AD and to provide a preclinical platform before performing clinical interventional research on novel therapeutic agents in humans. However, what aspects of human AD these mouse AD models faithfully recapitulate is insufficiently understood. We categorized mouse AD models into three groups: (i) inbred models, (ii) genetically engineered mice in which genes of interest are overexpressed or deleted in a specific cell type, and (iii) models induced by topical application of exogenous agents. To maximize benefits from current murine AD models, understanding the strengths and limitations of each model is essential when selecting a system suitable for a specific research question. We describe known and emerging AD mouse models and discuss the usefulness and pitfalls of each system.

Description of the intervention

Although there is currently no cure, various interventions exist to control symptoms of eczema. These interventions tend to target rehydration of the skin, reduction in inflammation, control of itch, and prevention and treatment of infection (Ersser 2014). Standard treatment is avoidance of triggers and irritants, and regular application of emollients and topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors (Wollenberg 2020). Severe cases may also be treated with phototherapy, immunosuppressive treatments or, more recently, dupilumab (a monoclonal antibody or biologic drug that works against chemical messengers called cytokines, specifically interleukin‐4 and interleukin‐13), and Janus kinase inhibitors (novel therapies that work on the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK‐STAT) intracellular signalling pathway of the immune response and can be used both in a topical and oral systemic form; Mendes 2020). Thorough assessment of the person with eczema's physical and psychological well‐being is also key to treatment (Duncan 2019). However, there are barriers to providing such support in dermatological practice, including time pressures, resources, and perhaps clinicians' levels of training, hence the need for evaluating the efficacy and economics of both psychological and educational interventions in this participant group.

There are some main eczema treatments that are commonly used but have been shown to be ineffective. These include antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists, probiotics, antibiotics, water softeners, silk clothing, and bath oils (Foisy 2011). In these cases, educational interventions might help in providing information to patients such that they might avoid unnecessary expenditure and potential harm. In addition, alternative or complementary therapies have been used in an attempt to treat eczema, and a wide range of approaches might be classified under this heading, ranging from food supplements to the use of practices such as aromatherapy, yoga, and massage. However, we have excluded alternative therapies from this review, as the focus here is on the use of educational and psychological interventions that are based on the findings from educational or psychological research and theory, and this is in keeping with inclusion criteria adopted by other reviews conducted in this area (Hashimoto 2017). Further, a range of psychological and educational interventions have been specifically developed and tested alongside the use of conventional medical treatments for eczema (i.e. as an adjunctive to emollient and topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitor use). Consequently, it is important that reviews of the literature focus specifically on evaluating the merits of using educational and psychological interventions in the management of eczema.

### Internet-based mindfulness and exposure treatment for atopic dermatitis… [^7519ce32]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Internet-based Mindfulness and Exposure Treatment for Atopic DermatitisClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Atopic dermatitis, characterized by chronic itching and inflammation, is highly prevalent and leads to suffering for the individual, increased risk of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and high societal costs. Several behavioral factors are likely to play a role in the exacerbating AD symptoms over time, not least scratching, which may lead to rupture in the skin barrier and an increased risk of inflammation, which in turns increases AD symptoms. AD is also associated with avoidance behaviors that may have negative longer-term effects. With this in mind, psychological treatment based on exposure may be a logical method to achieve improvements. A few psychological treatments have been tested for AD, but to our knowledge none of them have been built on recently developed methods for optimizing exposure treatment.

In a recently conducted pilot study we showed that exposure treatment, in combination with mindfulness training, can be associated with improvements for persons with AD. One challenge regarding psychological treatment is that accessibility is limited and there is a need for new methods that could be easily disseminated. One possible solution to this problem is to deliver psychological treatment via the Internet, which has been tested in more than 100 randomized trials with good results for other clinical disorders than AD. Internet-based treatment can be described as a form of online bibliotherapy where the individual is guided by a therapist who provides feedback on homework assignments. The aim of this study was to test the effects of Internet-delivered mindfulness and exposure treatment for AD in a randomized controlled trial.

We hypothesized that I-MET would lead to larger reductions of AD symptoms as well perceived stress, sleep problems, depressive symptoms, general anxiety, and improved self-rated health, compared to treatment as usual.

### Complementary and alternative interventions in atopic dermatitis [^ddd0fec6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The burden of atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), is significant and far-reaching. In addition to cost of care and therapies, it affects the quality of life for those affected as well as their caretakers. Complementary and alternative therapies are commonly used because of concerns about potential adverse effects of conventional therapies and frustration with the lack of response to prescribed medications, be it due to the severity of the AD or the lack of appropriate regular use. Despite the promising results reported with various herbal medicines and biologic products, the clinical efficacy of such alternative therapies remains to be determined. Physicians need to be educated about alternative therapies and discuss benefits and potential adverse effects or limitations with patients. A systematic approach and awareness of reputable and easily accessible resources are helpful in dealing with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The use of CAM interventions is common among individuals with AD. Epidemiologic data have been a motivating drive for better elucidation of the efficacy of CAM interventions for allergic disease. Herbal medicines and biologics for AD treatment and, more recently, prevention comprise a major area of clinical investigation. Potential mechanisms of therapeutic effect elucidated by animal models and human clinical studies implicate modulation of TH2-type allergic inflammation and induction of immune tolerance. Population-based research regarding the use of CAM for allergic diseases underscores the increasing challenge for care providers with respect to identifying CAM use and ensuring safe use of allopathic and complementary medicines in disease management.

### Translating translation into patient benefit for atopic eczema [^1e5dfe6d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence‐based treatments for atopic eczema

Atopic eczema is a disabling long‐term skin condition that has a profound negative impact on patients and their families and therapeutic options for moderate‐to‐severe disease remain limited. Although onset is usually in early childhood, atopic eczema may persist (particularly in more severe cases) or recur during adulthood where a prevalence of ~3–10% 1, 2 is reported. A significant percentage of adult patients have resistant disease that can significantly impair quality of life. Refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema in adults usually runs a prolonged and protracted course 3 and the unpredictable nature of disease flares is particularly troublesome. 4 The mainstay of treatment remains topical steroids and moisturisers. In 2000 an independent systematic review 5 highlighted the lack of therapeutic options for patients with atopic eczema not adequately controlled by optimised topical treatments and underscored the need for scientifically robust testing of a range of treatments for the disease. Indeed, there remains just one oral drug with a product license for moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema, ciclosporin. Furthermore, the British National Formulary recommends that treatment duration with cicloporin should be limited period for a maximum period of 2 months maximum in part because prolonged use of the drug is associated with hypertension, renal impairment and risk of cancer. 6, 7, 8, 9 A robust evidence base supporting other treatment options for refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema was therefore needed.

### Topical herbal medicines for atopic eczema: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^43ed18a3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of medicines with proven efficacy, many patients use complementary or alternative medicines (CAMs) to manage atopic eczema (AE). Due to the lack of objective information on topical CAMs, this systematic review evaluates the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of topical herbal preparations in AE. Using Cochrane systematic review methodology, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (via EBSCO), MEDLINE (via EBSCO), Proquest Health and Medical Complete, GREAT and CAM-QUEST were searched from inception until June 2014. Bibliographies of retrieved studies were hand searched for further relevant trials. All controlled clinical trials of topical herbal medicines for AE in humans of any age were included regardless of the control intervention or randomization. Only English-language publications were considered. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven investigated extracts of single plants and one an extract from multiple plants. Only two studies that showed a positive effect were considered to have a low risk of bias across all domains (those of liquorice gel and Hypericum perforatum). In these two, the test product was reported to be superior to placebo. Despite variations in diagnostic criteria and lack of validated tools for outcome assessments in one of these, the promising results may warrant continued research in better-designed studies. No meta-analysis was performed due to heterogeneity in all studies. There is currently insufficient evidence of efficacy for any topical herbal extract in AE. Many studies had methodological flaws and even those showing efficacy were single trials with small patient cohorts.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^d9e40110]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1–16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' Conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.

### 'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn' T die': a qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to eczema and implications for self-care [^03e3eb41]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Little qualitative research has been carried out among children with eczema. Wishes for a 'miracle cure' may be linked to the view of eczema as a condition that is likely to resolve. 12 We are not aware of similar work carried out among teenagers or young adults, although one qualitative study found that adolescents' attitudes can range from indifferent to more negative dependent on the severity of their eczema. 13 However, it is unclear how this perception links to how they adjust to having eczema. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of young people about the nature of their eczema and how these perceptions relate to self‐care of the condition and living with the condition.

### Complementary integrative approach for treating pruritus [^619979d7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a conservative and increasingly popular approach to treat pruritus for both patients and medical providers. CAM includes natural products, mind-body medicine, and manipulative and body-based practices. In this overview, we summarize current evidence, possible mechanisms and clinical approaches for treating pruritus with CAM techniques. We focus on pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, herpes zoster, chronic urticaria, burns, and postoperative contexts where the evidence for CAM approaches is promising.

### Topical therapy of atopic dermatitis: controversies from hippocrates to topical immunomodulators [^01163f9f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Although atopic dermatitis can be treated efficiently, there is still much controversy about the risk/benefit ratio of both topical corticosteroids and topical immunomodulators. Conflicting data may be found about the usefulness of bathing, diet regulation, and other therapeutic interventions. These controversies result in part from the persistence of Hippocratic doctrines in modern medical thinking. Humoralist and diathetic doctrines, as they pertain to eczema, are reviewed. The paradoxical worsening of oozing and the deadly hazards of hospitalization before the era of antibiotics are brought to mind. We hope that this historical review will improve the understanding of current controversies and help dermatologists to manage patients with atopic dermatitis and other chronic skin diseases.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^38f75030]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema, is a common and burdensome skin disease. Eczema is most common in early life, affecting up to 20% of infants and about 6% of school‐age children and adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide (De Lusignan 2021; Hay 2014; Langan 2023; Williams 2008). It is a chronic, fluctuating condition that varies in severity. In mild eczema, individuals may have only occasional localised patches of inflamed skin that cause minimal symptoms, but severe eczema causes extensive erythema, excoriations and chronic skin changes such as lichenification.

Eczema can have a substantial impact on quality of life and psychosocial domains (social, academic, and occupational) through persistent itch and the stigma associated with having visibly affected skin (Carroll 2005; Chamlin 2004; Drucker 2017; Lewis‐Jones 2006). The impact on quality of life can exceed that reported in other chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, especially when eczema is severe or affects readily visible areas (Beattie 2006; Drucker 2017; Kemp 2003; Vittrup 2023). Eczema also causes an economic burden and, in the USA alone, the direct costs of eczema are estimated as over 1 billion US dollars per year (Drucker 2017). Costs which affect people with eczema and their families include buying moisturisers, washing products or special clothing and taking time off work to care for a child with eczema (Carroll 2005).

### What is the evidence base for atopic eczema treatments? A summary of published randomized controlled trials [^21744dbc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition. While many AE treatment options are available, the evidence to support their efficacy varies in depth and quality. In 2000, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment systematic review identified and evaluated existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AE treatments. To ensure continuing utility, the NIHR commissioned an update to the review. Here, we present an overview of the updated report and its key findings. Systematic reviews and RCTs of AE treatments that included participants with AE (criteria based or diagnosed) were identified using Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register [searched to 31 August 2013 (RCTs) and 31 December 2015 (systematic reviews)]. Outcome measures included symptoms, AE severity, quality of life and adverse effects. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Of the 287 new RCTs identified, only 22 (8%) were judged to have a low risk of bias. When combined with RCTs from the previous review (n = 254), we found 'reasonable evidence of benefit' for corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, Atopiclair ®, ciclosporin, azathioprine, ultraviolet radiation and education programmes. Interventions with reasonable evidence of 'no benefit' included some dietary interventions, ion exchange water softeners, multiple daily applications of topical corticosteroids and antibiotic-containing corticosteroids for noninfected AE. Many common treatments lack evidence of efficacy and warrant further evaluation. The evidence base for AE is still hampered by poor trial design and reporting. The trials included in this review were used to establish the Global Resource of EczemA Trials (GREAT) database.

### 'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn' T die': a qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to eczema and implications for self-care [^1abd825a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for adaptation to the long‐term and episodic nature of eczema

Learning to live with the fluctuating and long‐term nature of eczema was related to a young person's adaptation to the condition. Overall, participants spoke about changes over time to how they adjusted to eczema, learnt how to live with it, and learnt to apply what they knew about controlling their eczema.

'Well since I was born with it I've learnt to accept… like I've learnt to live with it so, I couldn't really give you any experiences, it's something just… I honestly don't know cos it's always been part of me. I've never experienced having no eczema, so for me this is normal you know. And then you get people going, "Oh what's it like to have eczema then?" I'm like, "Well it's a bit… well, you know it's a pain but you know you just learn to live with it". And I've always, always struggled with it, so but as I've got older I've learnt to control it more'. Gabi, age 17 years

This adjustment was seen in two subthemes: how they struggled between accepting eczema as a long‐term condition while hoping it 'goes away', and the need to shift from expecting treatment will cure eczema to expecting the treatment will control eczema.

Striking a balance between acceptance and hope

Many participants described uncertainty about whether or not their eczema would have an impact on them in the long term. Some young people dealt with this uncertainty through accepting that their eczema was likely to be long term, while others continued to hope that it would go away. Both of these coping approaches had implications for self‐care. Successful adaptation required both hope and acceptance. Hoping that eczema would eventually improve motivated young people to seek and continue to seek effective self‐care strategies to find resolution for their eczema.

'Get it over with, it's not unmanageable. And I always get to like 90% healed and then 10% is left and I'm like, "OK, it's fine now". And then that 10% always strikes back so I need to squash out the 10% as well'. Zaahira, age 21 years

### The views of children and young people on the use of silk garments for the treatment of eczema: a nested qualitative study within the CLOTHing for the relief of eczema symptoms (CLOTHES) randomized controlled trial [^dc01f1bb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

A Mosaic approach 16 involving multiple participatory and adaptable, creative and fun 17 methods of data collection were used. 18 Elements of the 'least adult' role were adopted to support active child participation and children were enabled to 'take charge' and direct the research agenda. 19 For example E.W. followed the lead of the children in selecting activities and was fully engaged in these, consciously using children's language and testing understanding. Children chose what to do and how to share their feelings and experiences. For example, we created a story together with younger children based on a day in the life of Billy the puppet (Fig. 1), and they used drawings, stickers and two‐dimensional foam people to share their experiences. Towards the end of each data‐collection session, E.W. checked her understanding with the children. They photographed any artefacts as they were keen to take them home. As each photograph was taken the creator explained its significance to E.W. to ensure authenticity in data analysis and reporting. Each interaction ended with E.W. briefly recapping what had been said, explaining to the children what would happen to their data, and presentation of a certificate acknowledging their contribution. Data gathered using diverse methods from children aged 5–15 years varied in terms of content and the ways in which they were communicated. However, as seen in the data analysis below some strong and consistent messages were provided.

Figure 1
Billy the puppet.

Data analysis

To ensure faithful representation of child data we used three methods of holistic, selective and detailed analysis, 20 which involved viewing the data (interview transcripts, artefacts with child explanations and observer notes) as a whole, identifying phrases or ideas that represented the experience under study, and finally studying the data line by line in order to identify themes. Throughout analysis we were mindful of the age and developmental stage of participants that affected the verbal and nonverbal language they used. The analysis process was not linear but moved back and forth between wholes and parts. F.C. and E.W. reviewed the data alone and then together to ensure authenticity in portraying children's experiences. As data analysis progressed, emerging themes were discussed with the qualitative study team until shared understanding was achieved. At this stage the qualitative researchers were independent from the wider study team and findings were not shared until all elements of data analysis were completed.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for atopic dermatitis: an evidence-based review [^9f4595cc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Complementary and alternative interventions are becoming increasingly utilized as adjuncts to conventional treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). While the number of studies continues to grow, the vastness of the subject coupled with the relatively poor quality and small size of the studies limit their usefulness to clinicians.

Purpose

Our aim was to comprehensively review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of complementary and alternative therapies for AD.

Methods

Searches were performed on PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and the Global Resource for EczemA Trial (GREAT) databases, focusing on RCTs of alternative or complementary AD therapies, with a sample size of ≥ 10, through March 2015 and limited to the English language. A total of 70 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.

Results

There is at least some level I evidence to support the use of acupuncture and acupressure, stress-reducing techniques such as hypnosis, massage, and biofeedback, balneotherapy, herbal preparations (with many important caveats), certain botanical oils, oral evening primrose oil, vitamin D supplementation, and topical vitamin B 12. Many other therapies either have sufficient data to suggest that they are ineffective, or simply do not have enough evidence to formulate a verdict.

Conclusions

Careful review of the literature reveals several promising therapies in this domain; such findings may help direct further research that is necessary to bolster clinical recommendations for alternative or complementary treatments of AD.

Shift from seeking 'cure' to 'control' of eczema

As part of adapting and accepting eczema treatment as part of their daily lives, there was a shift from young people perceiving treatments as a means of curing eczema to a means of keeping eczema under control. People spoke about learning how to manage eczema, including applying their treatment, as having become part of their routine or habits.

'I'm hopeful that will like clear up my eye eczema. But then I think, I guess like the biggest thing I could hope for is that like, I know it's not gonna get cured, it's not something that's gonna go away probably for, it might like be able to manage it'. Willow, age 23 years

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^ef581ddd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) complementary therapies — at this time, there are little data to support the majority of complementary therapies tried for AD management. Chinese herbal therapy (traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]) has been the most extensively studied; while it may have some benefit for AD lesions, the results from RCTs of TCM taken orally are conflicting, and reports of serious hepatotoxicity and that some herbal creams have been found to be contaminated with TCS raise potential safety concerns. Acupuncture alone or in conjunction with TCM decreases signs and symptoms of AD, but the evidence is confined to small studies of limited quality. Massage therapy may improve symptoms and associated patient and parental anxiety levels; while it is a safe intervention, studies to date are small and of limited quality, precluding recommendation at this time. Other complementary therapies lacking sufficient evidence include: aromatherapy (no studies), homeopathy (1 positive prospective study), naturopathy (no studies), acupressure (1 study), and autologous blood injections (1 study).

### Alternative treatments for atopic dermatitis: an update [^f9c85770]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease in which management with topical anti-inflammatory agents during exacerbations remains the mainstay of treatment. With no cure in sight, a significant proportion of patients elect to incorporate complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Many clinicians find it difficult to provide recommendations as the field covers an extensive number of very disparate therapies, with limited quality evidence to indicate efficacy. Since publication of the last review on this topic in the Journal that compiled and analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CAMs in 2015, several new studies have surfaced. This update aims to aggregate and review these new data. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Global Resource for EczemA Trials (GREAT) databases for RCTs on complementary and alternative therapies in AD from March 2015 through May 2018, resulting in 15 studies being included in this review. The preliminary results for many treatments such as vitamin E, East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO), melatonin, L-histidine, and Manuka honey show positive clinical effects, but there is currently not enough evidence to recommend their use in AD therapy. Future investigative efforts should focus on reproducing some of these studies with a larger sample size whose clinical characteristics and demographics are more reflective of the general AD population, and standardizing the process to produce reliable data.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory skin disorder with significant morbidity. It is often a frustrating condition for both children and parents due to chronic and relapsing course. There is now an increasing understanding of the disease pathogenesis resulting in discovery of much wanted newer therapeutics and targeted therapies after a long time. Whether these interventions will result in sustained benefits or long term cure remains to be seen.

### Pediatric integrative medicine [^2f84d5eb]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirituality and prayer in pediatric care — prevalence, perceived effects, and evidence gaps: Spiritual healing includes prayer and has traditionally been identified as one of the most prevalent complementary therapies in the United States. Eighty-two percent of Americans believe in the healing power of personal prayer, 73% believe that praying for someone else can help cure their illness, and 77% believe that God sometimes intervenes to cure people who have a serious illness. Prayer is used by up to two-thirds of parents for their children. Studies have suggested that spiritual and/or religious beliefs and practices may contribute to decreased stress and increased sense of well-being and enhanced immune system functioning. A large systematic literature review demonstrated that the majority of patients express interest in a discussion of religion and spirituality in the medical visit, and spirituality in health care is especially relevant to children in oncology and palliative care settings. RCTs of the clinical therapeutic effects of prayer in pediatrics are lacking, and national efforts promote use of the FICA Spiritual History tool in clinical care; categories covered include Faith and belief, Importance, Community, and Address in care. Some states have pursued legal measures against parents seeking prayer or spiritual healing as an alternative to conventional medical therapy for children with serious medical problems, such as cancer.

### Is integrative medicine the next new frontier in medicine? [^085662c4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods are increasingly being used by patients in the Western world to treat autoimmune or allergic diseases. Patients use these methodologies of their own accord, frequently against the advice of their physicians. Integrative medicine hopes to merge the benefits of both conventional Western medicine and CAM. More and more research is being conducted to decipher the secrets behind the thousands of years of experience that CAM offers. Are these treatments effective, and are they safe? Or do they act simply by the "placebo effect". This unique issue attempts to bring integrative medicine to greater awareness among Western physicians and practitioners.

### How we treat atopic dermatitis now and how that will change over the next 5 years [^a97b11f4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We live in exciting times in atopic dermatitis therapeutics, with many novel treatments in the clinical trial pipeline. Frustratingly, most of these trials are vehicle- or placebo-controlled, rather than head-to-head comparisons. Network meta-analyses can rank treatments against each other, even for placebo-controlled studies, aiding evidence-based guideline formulation and clinical decision-making. Treatment registries are an important additional vehicle to collect 'real-world' data on the long-term (cost) effectiveness and safety of the new drugs, outside of the stringent and short-term settings of clinical trials. As further agents enter clinical practice, the need for biomarkers of treatment response and drug safety becomes more pressing to move us towards personalized medicine and to avoid wasting healthcare resources. This review takes stock of our current treatment armamentarium for atopic dermatitis, highlights important gaps in our knowledge - including the relatively low number of studies conducted in children - and maps out how our treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis can become more targeted and holistic in the future.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Guideline limitations — Limitations of these guidelines include focusing on the most common aspects of AD care, and the authors state they did not address Traditional, Complementary, or Integrative medicines or Indigenous Ways of Knowing, aiming to address these in subsequent living guidelines as evidence emerges. The guideline notes that AD lacks robust evidence for safety of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and calls for well-conducted studies for this population. It also highlights that many AD trials are placebo controlled and calls for funding and investigations through professional, government, and private organizations to promote comparative effectiveness and safety of approved medications and their optimal use in treatment pathways, with robust data in pregnant patients and comparative effectiveness informing future recommendations.

### Managing dermatology patients who prefer "all natural" treatments [^9b500ea2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dermatology patients are expressing a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and natural treatment options for management of dermatologic conditions. Counseling on the optimal integration of CAM with conventional therapeutic approaches can be daunting for practitioners who do not feel well-versed in these modalities. A productive conversation between the clinician and patient seeking natural treatments should address the appropriate role and scope of CAM in a therapeutic plan, which is best suited for use as maintenance therapy or to augment traditional pharmaceutical or procedural interventions. Understanding the patient's goals, discussing evidence-based conventional and complementary treatment options, and employing shared decision making can enhance the clinical encounter and strengthen the physician-patient relationship.

### Probiotics for treating eczema [^101fb8b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font).

Main Results

We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics. For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period. Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile. We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments. Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points. We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall. We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events. Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes. Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.

### Halobetasol propionate and tazarotene (Duobrii) [^1fa2287d]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

How should I use DUOBRII?

Use DUOBRII exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
If you shower or bathe before applying DUOBRII, your skin should be dry before applying the lotion.
Apply a thin layer of DUOBRII to the affected areas 1 time each day and rub in gently.
You should not use more than 50 grams of DUOBRII in 1 week.
Avoid using DUOBRII on your face, groin, or underarms (armpits).
Do not bandage, wrap, or cover the treated skin area(s) unless your healthcare provider tells you to.

What should I avoid during treatment with DUOBRII?

Avoid sunlight, including sunlamps and tanning beds during your treatment with DUOBRII. DUOBRII can make your skin more sensitive to the sun and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn. Use sunscreen, and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you get sunburn during treatment with DUOBRII. If you do get sunburn, do not use DUOBRII until your sunburn is healed.
Avoid using DUOBRII on skin with eczema because it may cause severe irritation.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments in psychodermatology [^8e6a8af2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The author believes that psychocutaneous medicine has indeed come of age and is being incorporated into mainstream medical practice. Patients presenting to dermatologists today are more sophisticated and are frequently dissatisfied with traditional medical therapies. They actively seek alternative approaches and adjuncts to standard treatments. In contrast to many other "alternative" (or) "holistic" treatments offered through non-medical venues, dermatologists can assure their patients that controlled studies support the efficacy of psychocutaneous techniques in improving many dermatologic conditions. Psoriasis, rosacea, herpes simplex, body dysmorphic disorder, acne, eczema, urticaria, neurotic excoriations, excoriated acne, trichotillomania, dysesthetic syndromes, and delusions parasitosis are included in this incomplete list. The author believes it is helpful for both the patient and therapist to define concrete and realistic goals for psychocutaneous intervention. Concrete observable or measurable goals can help the patient and clinician gauge therapeutic progress and success. Specifically, goals can include reduction in pruritus (rating severity from 1–10), decreased scratching activity, decreased plaque extent or thickness, decreased number of urticarial plaques, decreased flushing, decreased anxiety, decreased anger, decreased social embarrassment, decreased social withdrawal, and improved sleep. More global goals can include an improved sense of well-being, increased sense of control, and enhanced acceptance of some of the inevitable aspects of a given skin disease. Cure should never be a goal, because most disorders amenable to psychocutaneous techniques are chronic in nature; thus, cure as an endpoint would only lead to disappointment. The author encourages dermatologists to align themselves with what he euphemistically calls "a skin-emotion specialist". The skin-emotion specialist may be a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, biofeedback therapist, or other mental health or behavioral specialist. Patients are more likely to accept a referral to a "skin-emotion specialist", because this term destigmatizes psychologic interventions. Incorporating these techniques and specialists into a clinical practice will expand therapeutic horizons and improve the quality of life of many of the patients afflicted with chronic skin disease. A final caveat must be offered about attempting to make prognostic statements regarding the likelihood of therapeutic success. Although all patients can potentially benefit from psychocutaneous interventions, those with severe psychopathology and poor pretreatment functional status are likely to be more difficult to treat and to achieve less optimal outcomes. Patients with personality disorders such as borderline, narcissistic, and schizotypal disorders, and patients with any active psychotic process certainly constitute a more resistant and difficult population with whom therapeutic success is less likely. These patients, however, are often the ones in the greatest subjective distress and certainly can profit from any of the described interventions. Quoting W. Mitchell Sams, Jr., "although the physician is a scientist and clinician, he or she is and must be something more. A doctor is a caretaker of the patient's person — a professional advisor, guiding the patient through some of life's most difficult journeys. Only the clergy share this responsibility with us". This commitment is and must always be the guiding force in the provision of comprehensive and compatient patient care.

Background Psychological interventions for atopic dermatitis in children are not well-studied, despite the potential benefits, which may include: decreased need for medications and improved long-term control of both dermatologic symptoms as well as other secondary symptoms that may impact quality of life, such as anxiety, insomnia, and psychosocial distress. Chida and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of psychological interventions for AD. Of the eight studies that were included in the meta-analysis, only four studies examined pediatric patients. A wide-range of psychological interventions were evaluated, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management programs, aromatherapy massage, psychodynamic therapy, and structured educational programs focusing on a wide range of medical and psychological topics.

Seven of the eight studies showed some positive effects on measures of eczema severity, scratching/itching, use of topical steroids, and anxiety. More recently, Ersser and colleagues evaluated the literature on psychological and educational interventions for AD focusing on studies conducted among children. Ten randomized controlled trials were reviewed, including 9 educational interventions and one study that evaluated a psychological intervention. Particular promise in terms of modest improvement in disease severity and quality of life was noted in a large study that utilized a multidisciplinary group education intervention in an inpatient setting. However, the authors of the review concluded that there is a lack of research on this topic. Accordingly, additional studies evaluating psychological and educational interventions are needed.

Previous studies have evaluated time- and resource-intensive interventions that may not be practical outside of a randomized controlled trial or a large academic research setting. Nevertheless, adjunctive psychological interventions are promising for reducing symptoms associated with severe dermatologic issues. To address this gap, the current study will evaluate the utility and acceptability of a brief self-help behavioral intervention in a pilot study, which emphasizes the effectiveness of the study design. A brief self-help intervention that utilizes well-supported cognitive and behavioral psychological strategies will be distributed to interested patients and families to augment the standard skin-directed treatments for eczema or AD. It is hypothesized that the adjunctive self-help behavioral treatment will reduce the severity of eczema and improve quality of life for patients who receive the intervention compared to patients who only receive standard dermatologic treatment.

Additionally, itching intensity, scratching behaviors, and anxiety symptoms will be included as outcome measures. Specific Aims Aim 1: Pilot a brief self-help behavioral intervention to be delivered to children with eczema or AD and their parents.

### Homeopathy for eczema: a systematic review of controlled clinical trials [^b0978bda]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Homeopathy is often advocated for patients with eczema.

Objectives

This article systematically reviews the evidence from controlled clinical trials of any type of homeopathic treatment for any type of eczema.

Methods

Electronic searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library with no restrictions on time or language. In addition, the bibliographies of the retrieved articles and our departmental files were hand searched. All controlled trials of homeopathy in patients with eczema were considered. Their methodological quality was estimated using the Jadad score.

Results

One randomized and two nonrandomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All were methodologically weak. None demonstrated the efficacy of homeopathy.

Conclusions

The evidence from controlled clinical trials therefore fails to show that homeopathy is an efficacious treatment for eczema.

### Recent insights into atopic dermatitis and implications for management of infectious complications [^3cde5bd0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common complex disease that frequently follows a chronic relapsing course and affects the quality of life of patients and families in a significant manner. New insights into the pathophysiology of AD point to an important role of structural abnormalities in the epidermis combined with immune dysregulation. Patients with AD have a unique predisposition to colonization or infection by a number of microbial organisms, most notably Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus. A multipronged approach directed at healing or protecting the skin barrier and addressing the immune dysregulation is necessary to improve the likelihood of successful outcomes.

### 'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn' T die': a qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to eczema and implications for self-care [^454bcd39]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Eczema is a common childhood inflammatory skin condition, affecting more than one in five children. A popular perception is that children 'outgrow eczema', although epidemiological studies have shown that, for many, eczema follows a lifelong episodic course.

Objectives

To explore the perceptions of young people about the nature of their eczema and how these perceptions relate to their self‐care and adapting to living with eczema.

Methods

This is a secondary inductive thematic analysis of interviews conducted for Healthtalk.org. In total 23 interviews with young people with eczema were included. Of the 23 participants, 17 were female and six male, ranging from 17 to 25 years old.

Results

Participants generally experienced eczema as an episodic long‐term condition and reported a mismatch between information received about eczema and their experiences. The experience of eczema as long term and episodic had implications for self‐care, challenging the process of identifying triggers of eczema flare‐ups and evaluating the success of treatment regimens. Participants' experiences of eczema over time also had implications for adaptation and finding a balance between accepting eczema as long term and hoping it would go away. This linked to a gradual shift in treatment expectations from 'cure' to 'control' of eczema.

Conclusions

For young people who continue to experience eczema beyond childhood, a greater focus on self‐care for a long‐term condition may be helpful. Greater awareness of the impact of early messages around 'growing out of' eczema and provision of high‐quality information may help patients to manage expectations and support adaptation to treatment regimens.

What's already known about this topic?

There is a common perception that people 'grow out of' eczema, but for many people eczema follows a lifelong episodic course.
Qualitative work has shown that parents can find that being told their child will grow out of eczema is dismissive, and that they have difficulty with messages about 'control not cure' of eczema.
It is unclear how young people perceive their eczema and the implications of this perception for their adaptation and self‐care.

What does this study add?

The message that many people 'grow out of' eczema has a potentially detrimental effect for young people where the condition persists.
This has implications for young people's perceptions of their eczema, their learning to self‐care and how they adapt to living with eczema and eczema treatments.

What are the clinical implications of this work?

Clinicians need to promote awareness among young people that eczema is a long‐term episodic condition in order to engage them with effective self‐care.
Young people transitioning to self‐care need evidence‐based information that is specific and relatable to them.

### Complementary and alternative medicine herbal therapies for atopic disorders [^7eaa3390]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

More than 42% of patients with atopic disorders use some type of complementary or alternative medicine, underscoring the importance of determining the scientific validity of such treatments. This review summarizes herbal therapies from China, Japan, Korea, and India, and provides an introduction to some Western preparations. Although well-controlled scientific studies of many of the Asian herbal therapies have been carried out, and some basic studies have been performed for various herbal components (active ingredients), additional research is needed to assess the composite effects of many of these remedies.

### Chinese herbal medicine for atopic eczema [^38e23e20]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been increasingly used for atopic eczema. A previous version of this Cochrane review published in 2004 found some evidence of a possible benefit for oral ingestion of CHM for eczema, but the results were inconclusive and the evidence needs to be updated. We have expanded the scope of this review to include an assessment of the topical and oral effects of CHM for eczema.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral ingestion and topical applications of CHM for the management of eczema in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched the following from inception: SCOPUS, HERBMED, ProQuest, CQVIP, CNKI, and Wanfang Data. We also searched trials registers, handsearched conference proceedings, checked the reference lists of all included and excluded studies and review articles for further references to relevant trials, and contacted experts in Chinese medicine for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults with eczema comparing CHM to placebo; no intervention; active controls, including acupuncture; or conventional medicines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors selected the RCTs, extracted data, and assessed quality independently. We contacted study authors for missing data. We collected adverse events from the included studies.

Main Results

We included 28 studies, with a total of 2306 participants. We assessed most of the studies at high 'risk of bias', particularly in blinding of participants and personnel, and there was substantial inconsistency between studies, so any positive effect of CHM must be treated with caution. We did not include the four studies from the previous version in this review, because they investigated a CHM product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004. Four studies (three oral and one topical) compared CHM to placebo. Pooled data from 2 studies showed the total effectiveness rate in the CHM group was higher (by risk ratio (RR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 3.32; 2 studies; n = 85), and the itching visual analogue score (VAS) in the CHM group was 1.53 lower (by standardised mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 2.64 to 0.41; 2 Studies; n = 94) than the placebo group, where a lower VAS score indicates reduced itch. One study of 85 participants with moderate to severe eczema who received an oral CHM formula for 12 weeks reported a quality of life (QoL) score 2.5 lower in the CHM group (by difference in means (MD), 95% CI 4.77 to 0.23; 1 study; n = 85) than the placebo group, where a lower score indicates better QoL. Twenty-two studies and 1 arm from a study with a 4-arm parallel controlled design compared CHM (5 oral, 6 topical, and 12 mixed oral and topical) to conventional medicines. The total effectiveness rate in the CHM groups was superior (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.61; 21 studies; n = 1868; very low quality evidence), and the itching VAS in the CHM groups was 0.83 lower (SMD, 95% CI 1.43 to 0.22; 7 studies; n = 465) than the comparators. Two studies compared combined oral and topical CHM to the same oral CHM formula alone. The total effectiveness rate in 1 study was not statistically significant (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.63; 1 study; n = 20). In the other study, the itching VAS in the CHM group was 1.05 lower (MD, 95% CI 1.75 to 0.35; 1 study; n = 23) than the control group. With regard to side-effects, four studies did not give any report of adverse events. The other 24 studies reported minor adverse events, which were reversed soon after stopping CHM. One participant withdrew from one trial because of exacerbation of their condition after using the CHM intervention. Eight studies received government funding.

Authors' Conclusions

We could not find conclusive evidence that CHM taken by mouth or applied topically to the skin could reduce the severity of eczema in children or adults. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for managing eczema.

### 'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn' T die': a qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to eczema and implications for self-care [^0df4713f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Eczema is a common condition that typically starts within the first 2 years of life, recurring episodically throughout childhood. It is often expected to improve by adolescence. 1 However, epidemiological evidence shows that eczema frequently persists into adolescence 2 or adulthood, and is better viewed as a lifelong episodic condition. 3, 4 In this study we use the term 'eczema' to refer to 'atopic eczema' (synonymous with 'atopic dermatitis'). 5

The view of eczema as a condition that is likely to resolve by adolescence may have implications for how people with eczema and their families perceive the condition. Qualitative research has shown that parents of children with eczema can find assurances that their child will 'grow out of it' as a 'fobbing off' or dismissal of the seriousness of the condition. 6, 7 Furthermore, viewing eczema as a childhood condition rather than a longer‐term condition may contribute to families' discomfort with messages about treatments aiming to 'control' not 'cure' the condition, 6, 8 with implications for their adherence to long‐term time‐consuming treatments such as applying emollients.

Existing research therefore suggests the message that 'eczema will resolve' may influence how people perceive advice and approaches to self‐care of the condition. It is also possible that such messages influence how people with eczema and their families 'adapt' to the condition. In the unified theory, Moss‐Morris 9 postulates that successful adaptation to a long‐term condition requires adjustment of both cognitive (e.g. beliefs and attitudes) and behavioural (e.g. adherence to regimens) factors. According to the unified theory, adaptation subsequently leads to positive outcomes in distress, good illness management and less interference in life.

For adolescents and emerging adults, adaptation would occur during a time where the management of a condition becomes a shared task, transferring primary responsibility from the family and parents to the young person. 10 Adolescence and emerging adulthood is a time for developing individual social identity and autonomy from parents. 11 Learning to take responsibility or share responsibility for the long‐term condition therefore comes at a time where they are also seeking autonomy, which may have an impact on adjustment and self‐care.

### Understanding economic evidence for the prevention and treatment of atopic eczema [^eec10d54]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcome‐only studies

Six studies that just considered outcomes were identified. 57, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 These studies may help to inform the design of future economic evaluations or to parameterize economic models. Two papers conducted a willingness‐to‐pay study in Germans with eczema. 61, 62 Both studies found that patients would be willing to spend in the range of €50 (for controlled eczema) to €150 (for uncontrolled eczema) per month to achieve a complete cure.

Stevens et al. developed a disease‐specific preference‐based health measure, Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Life (ADQoL), for economic evaluation of children with eczema. 65 Parental interviews generated items that formed 16 unique health states, which were then valued using standard gamble methods, which presents respondents with two alternatives, one a certain outcome in some suboptimal health state, and the other a probability of being in perfect health or immediately dead. The probability is varied until the respondent is indifferent between the two alternatives. Mean ± SD estimates for the 16 health states ranged from 0.36 ± 0.36 for the worst state to 0.84 ± 0.19 for the best health state. ADQoL has been used in few trial evaluations, although the estimates in the paper have been more widely used in economic modelling studies. Only three trial‐based full‐ or feasibility‐stage economic evaluations in this review used the ADQoL descriptive system to elicit a health state description for each participant. 13, 50, 57 Francis et al. tested the construct and face validity of the ADQoL completed by parents of children with eczema vs. the clinical measures Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQoL). 57, 65 This study supported the use of ADQoL but noted that parents of the youngest participants found it harder to complete. Only two studies considered outcome studies in a paediatric population. 57, 65 As eczema often starts in childhood there is a need to have measures of utility that are suitable and validated in the very young.

### The use of alternative medicine in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^7cf74d33]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Alternative medicine has been defined as forms of therapy or examination that have no scientific basis and for which no effective or diagnostic reliability has been demonstrated by scientific methods. The use of complementary or alternative medicine is increasing and controlled clinical trials on the subject are few. We performed a questionnaire-based study of 80 pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis. This questionnaire assessed the duration of treatment, the reason(s) for trying alternative therapy, the approximate cost and the success of the treatment, the duration of the childhood eczema, and whether the child had ever required hospital admission for eczema. Of the total, 34 (42.5%) patients had used alternative medicine. Herbal remedies and homeopathy were used most often. Most treatments were reported to show no benefit and in three instances deterioration was reported. This study has prompted us to enquire routinely regarding alternative medicine use. Alternative therapies are subject to minimal regulation and have been associated with serious side effects. We would recommend enquiries regarding alternative medicine use in all pediatric dermatology patients.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2016. part 1: treatment and prevention [^838dbd03]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review is part of a series of annual updates summarizing the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 28 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2016 with a focus on treatment and prevention of AE. There is reasonable evidence of benefit for topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, a glycyrrhetinic acid-containing preparation (Atopiclair ®), oral ciclosporin, oral azathioprine, narrowband ultraviolet B radiation and education programmes. Overall, there is evidence that topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors have similar efficacy and that both can prevent AE flares when used twice weekly as maintenance therapy. However, topical calcineurin inhibitors are costlier and have more adverse reactions, thus topical corticosteroids should remain the standard of care for patients with AE. There is no evidence that multiple applications are better than once-daily application of topical corticosteroid. There is inconsistent evidence to support omalizumab and specific allergen immunotherapy use in AE. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation and synbiotics reduce AE severity, although the margin of improvement may not be clinically meaningful. There is little evidence to support the use of wet wraps or of complementary/alternative medicine (including Chinese herbal medicine). There is some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fish in infancy may be preventative for AE, but other dietary interventions for the prevention of AE show little promise. This review provides a succinct guide for clinicians and patients wishing to remain up to date with the latest evidence for the treatment and prevention of AE.

### Efficacy and safety of topical brepocitinib for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-ranging and parallel-group study [^3b971bb4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic skin disease that affects up to 10% of adults and 20% of children in developed countries. AD negatively impacts the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers/families, with greater disease severity being associated with poorer HRQoL. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, guidelines recommend regimented hygiene, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which can be used in combination with other treatments such as phototherapy for moderate‐to‐severe or refractory AD. The ultimate goals for treatment are to repair and maintain the skin barrier, to reduce sensations of itching and burning, and to prevent AD relapse. Despite current treatments, there is still an unmet need for safe and effective therapies to improve disease management and long‐term patient outcomes.

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^b549e6b8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

### Long-term control of atopic dermatitis with platelet-rich plasma [^d7d6e816]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AD is a common chronic skin condition affecting 15%-20% of children and 1%-3% of adults worldwide. The pathophysiology of AD is complex, and many genetic and environmental factors leading to skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation contribute to its development. Currently, there are no cures for AD, and most treatments, including moisturizers and topical or systemic agents, are limited to providing temporary relief of symptoms. Moreover, in cases of persistent eczema, prolonged use of some treatment options, such as topical and systemic corticosteroids, has a potential to cause adverse effects.

PRP is an autologous blood-derived product containing above-baseline concentrations of platelets. When PRP is injected into the skin, activated platelets degranulate, releasing growth factors, such as platelet-derived, transforming, vascular endothelial, epidermal, and fibroblast growth factors. These play an important role in inducing angiogenesis, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as extracellular matrix synthesis. The stimulation of these natural healing processes by the PRP injections promotes tissue regeneration and rejuvenation.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^8bd1e97a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

Mechanism of action of systemic therapies in atopic eczema

Although recent research has provided significant insight into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of atopic eczema, the mechanism of therapies that are effective in this disease remains incompletely understood. Interestingly, genetic studies provide evidence of distinct genetic loci for atopic eczema and psoriasis and where loci are shared the effect appears to be in the opposite direction for the two diseases. 27 On the other hand, a number of therapies including topical calcineurin inhibitors, narrow‐band UVB phototherapy and systemic agents such as ciclosporin and methotrexate are effective for both psoriasis and atopic eczema.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2018. part 1: prevention and topical therapies [^2eebb607]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

This review is part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). The aim is to provide a succinct guide for clinicians on the key findings from 14 systematic reviews on the prevention and topical treatment of AE published or indexed in 2018. Various supplements, including long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D and the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, given prenatally and postnatally, have not been shown to prevent AE in infants, although mixed strains of probiotics may decrease the risk of AE if given to the mother during pregnancy and to the infant for the first 6 months of life. In the postnatal period, there is no evidence that hydrolysed formula, compared with cow's milk formula (CMF), reduces the risk of AE in partially breastfed infants. However, weak evidence suggests that a specific partially hydrolysed whey formula decreases the risk of AE compared with CMF. No specific skin practices can be recommended to reduce the eczema risk in healthy term babies. There is weak evidence of a low risk of reversible hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression following 2–4 weeks of treatment with low‐potency topical steroids, and conflicting evidence as to whether bleach bathing affects skin flora or AE severity. A single study demonstrated that the topical Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib at 2% significantly reduces the Eczema Area and Severity Index compared with vehicle. Topical naltrexone cream 1% improves pruritus (measured using a visual analogue scale) by 30% more than placebo. There is weak evidence that topical alternative therapies, including antioxidants, micronutrients and some herbal medicines, may improve AE.

It specifies that this document is the first section in the series and covers methods for diagnosis and monitoring of AD, disease severity and quality of life scales for outcomes measurement, and common clinical associations that affect patients, and notes that a discussion on known risk factors for the development of AD is also presented. It further states that the second guideline in the series will address the management and treatment of AD with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic topical modalities; the third section will cover phototherapy and systemic treatment options; and the fourth section will address the minimization of disease flares, educational interventions, and use of adjunctive approaches.

Atopic dermatitis — Recommendation 12 (mild disease; dilute bleach baths): In patients with mild atopic dermatitis, the JTF panel suggests against adding dilute bleach baths to topical therapy (no dilute-bleach based) baths (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). The estimated treatment effect of dilute bleach baths for milder AD (eg, EASI of 10) was, on average, small (−2.2 points in comparison to a minimally important difference of 6.6). The guideline panel inferred that most well-informed patients with mild AD are likely to place a high value on maintaining a simple treatment routine that is minimally disruptive, and most fully informed patients are likely to value avoidance of the burdens of bleach baths and their uncertain harms over likely a small, possibly unimportant, benefit in AD severity, while acknowledging substantial variability in values such that a number of patients might opt for adjunctive dilute bleach baths even if disease activity is mild.

### The sound of silence: where are the voices of patients in eczema guideline development? [^20f396a8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment pipeline for eczema is flush with new options that stand to transform care and quality of life for people who live with eczema. During this time of rapid change, medical societies are updating their clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to reflect the expanding treatment landscape. However, we are concerned that these much‐needed updates will occur without input from the population they are ultimately meant to serve: patients and their caregivers.

A recent systematic review published in the British Journal of Dermatology found that < 25% of the current eczema guidelines reported patient or caregiver participation. This glaring absence raises questions about the robustness of the CPG development process, and undermines the credibility, practicality and validity of these guidelines.

As patient organization leaders, we are charged with advocating on behalf of the patients and families we serve and ensuring that their voices are reflected in policy decisions and medical care that will affect them. Our position stems from our mission and mandate – but other institutions focused on methodological standards have come to the same conclusion. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine outlined the principles of trustworthy CPGs and highlighted the paramount importance of including external stakeholder input in order 'to increase the likelihood that practical problems in guideline application will be identified and addressed' and to 'increase a sense of involvement or ownership among audiences of the varying guidelines'. Likewise, the AGREE II instrument for evaluating CPGs, the World Health Organization and the Guidelines International Network all recommend that guideline developers incorporate the views of individuals impacted by the recommendations, ideally by including patients and their caregivers in CPG development. Similarly, the GRADE Working Groupemphasizes, in their Evidence to Decision framework, the importance of including the patients' experiences, values and preferences.

### Educational and psychological interventions for managing atopic dermatitis (eczema) [^5a1a6308]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Atopic dermatitis (eczema), can have a significant impact on well‐being and quality of life for affected people and their families. Standard treatment is avoidance of triggers or irritants and regular application of emollients and topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Thorough physical and psychological assessment is central to good‐quality treatment. Overcoming barriers to provision of holistic treatment in dermatological practice is dependent on evaluation of the efficacy and economics of both psychological and educational interventions in this participant group. This review is based on a previous Cochrane review published in 2014, and now includes adults as well as children.

Objectives

To assess the clinical outcomes of educational and psychological interventions in children and adults with atopic dermatitis (eczema) and to summarise the availability and principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO and two trials registers up to March 2023. We checked the reference lists of included studies and related systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. We searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE and Embase for economic evaluations on 8 June 2022.

Selection criteria

Randomised, cluster‐randomised and cross‐over RCTs that assess educational and psychological interventions for treating eczema in children and adults.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes were reduction in disease severity, as measured by clinical signs, patient‐reported symptoms and improvement in health‐related quality‐of‐life (HRQoL) measures. Secondary outcomes were improvement in long‐term control of symptoms, improvement in psychological well‐being, improvement in standard treatment concordance and adverse events. We assessed short‐ (up to 16 weeks after treatment) and long‐term time points (more than 16 weeks).

Main results

We included 37 trials (6170 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (34/37), in outpatient settings (25/37). We judged three trials to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifteen trials had a high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to bias in measurement of the outcome. Trials assessed interventions compared to standard care.

Individual educational interventions may reduce short‐term clinical signs (measured by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD); mean difference (MD) −5.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.39 to −2.01; 1 trial, 30 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but patient‐reported symptoms, HRQoL, long‐term eczema control and psychological well‐being were not reported.

Group education interventions probably reduce clinical signs (SCORAD) both in the short term (MD −9.66, 95% CI −19.04 to −0.29; 3 studies, 731 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and the long term (MD −7.22, 95% CI −11.01 to −3.43; 3 studies, 1424 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and probably reduce long‐term patient‐reported symptoms (SMD −0.47 95% CI −0.60 to −0.33; 2 studies, 908 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). They may slightly improve short‐term HRQoL (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.36 to −0.01; 4 studies, 746 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to short‐term psychological well‐being (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); MD −2.47, 95% CI −5.16 to 0.22; 1 study, 80 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Long‐term eczema control was not reported.

We don't know whether technology‐mediated educational interventions could improve short‐term clinical signs (SCORAD; 1 study; 29 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). They may have little or no effect on short‐term patient‐reported symptoms (Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM); MD −0.76, 95% CI −1.84 to 0.33; 2 studies; 195 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and probably have little or no effect on short‐term HRQoL (MD 0, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.03; 2 studies, 430 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Technology‐mediated education interventions probably slightly improve long‐term eczema control (Recap of atopic eczema (RECAP); MD −1.5, 95% CI −3.13 to 0.13; 1 study, 232 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and may improve short‐term psychological well‐being (MD −1.78, 95% CI −2.13 to −1.43; 1 study, 24 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Habit reversal treatment may reduce short‐term clinical signs (SCORAD; MD −6.57, 95% CI −13.04 to −0.1; 1 study, 33 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but we are uncertain about any effects on short‐term HRQoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI); 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Patient‐reported symptoms, long‐term eczema control and psychological well‐being were not reported.

We are uncertain whether arousal reduction therapy interventions could improve short‐term clinical signs (Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); 1 study, 24 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or patient‐reported symptoms (visual analogue scale (VAS); 1 study, 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Arousal reduction therapy may improve short‐term HRQoL (Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI); MD −2.1, 95% CI −4.41 to 0.21; 1 study, 91 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and psychological well‐being (PSS; MD −1.2, 95% CI −3.38 to 0.98; 1 study, 91 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Long‐term eczema control was not reported.

No studies reported standard care compared with self‐help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education; or adverse events.

We identified two health economic studies. One found that a 12‐week, technology‐mediated, educational‐support programme may be cost neutral. The other found that a nurse practitioner group‐education intervention may have lower costs than standard care provided by a dermatologist, with comparable effectiveness.

Authors' conclusions

In‐person, individual education, as an adjunct to conventional topical therapy, may reduce short‐term eczema signs compared to standard care, but there is no information on eczema symptoms, quality of life or long‐term outcomes. Group education probably reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the long term and may also improve quality of life in the short term. Favourable effects were also reported for technology‐mediated education, habit reversal treatment and arousal reduction therapy. All favourable effects are of uncertain clinical significance, since they may not exceed the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcome measures used (MCID 8.7 points for SCORAD, 3.4 points for POEM). We found no trials of self‐help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education. Future trials should include more diverse populations, address shared priorities, evaluate long‐term outcomes and ensure patients are involved in trial design.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) and probiotics/prebiotics — evidence and recommendation: Probiotics are live microorganisms that modify the overall composition of this microbiota and potentially modulate the host immune response. However, studies have found limited evidence to support their use as a treatment for established AD. A Cochrane review of 12 RCTs involving 785 children (age 3 months to 13 years) included a variety of probiotic strains and found no significant differences in symptoms or disease severity compared to placebo. On metaanalysis, the effect of probiotics, even if present, was small and likely not clinically noticeable (a statistically significant SCORAD decrease of 2.47 points [95% CI, −4.72 to −0.21]; P = 0.03; noted only after correcting for baseline severity differences; 2 studies could not be pooled with this method). These studies included prebiotics, specialized plant fibers to help nourish the bacteria, but also with mixed effects. Pro-/prebiotic use cannot be recommended at this time (level of evidence in Table III).

### Treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic eczema in adults within the U.K.: results of a national survey of dermatologists [^8d37b906]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema is a disabling long‐term condition. Although it is often considered a disease of childhood, the prevalence of atopic eczema in adults is about 3–10%. 1, 2 Atopic eczema is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction and chronic inflammation. The itching, associated loss of sleep and skin infections that accompany moderate‐to‐severe disease significantly impair quality of life. Although around 60% of children will go into remission by adolescence, refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema in adults usually runs a prolonged and protracted course, 3 typically affecting over 40% of the body surface area. 4, 5 While many adult patients respond to treatment with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors and moisturizers, a significant percentage have recalcitrant disease.

Adults with moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema refractory to topical treatments may be considered for phototherapy or systemic drug treatment. Currently, ciclosporin is the only oral drug licensed for refractory atopic eczema. It should be used only for a limited period (the British National Formulary recommends 2 months maximum) because prolonged use is associated with hypertension, renal impairment and risk of cancer. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

In 2000 a systematic review 12 highlighted the lack of therapeutic options for patients with refractory atopic eczema and underscored the need for robust testing of a range of treatments for the disease. Investigators responded with clinical trials assessing a variety of modalities of phototherapy and a number of systemic agents, often adapted from use in other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In 2012, the European Dermatology Forum, the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis, the European Federation of Allergy, the European Society of Pediatric Dermatology and the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network published a consensus set of guidelines for the treatment of atopic eczema. 9 This summarized the evidence base for phototherapy and systemic agents. The 2013 European TREatment of severe Atopic eczema in children Taskforce (TREAT) survey provided valuable information about treatment of atopic eczema in children across eight European countries, including the U.K. 2 Whether or not dermatologists are following national and international guidelines on treatment of atopic eczema in adults, and indeed their degree of knowledge of the evidence base, is not known.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as' add-on' therapy to topical treatment for eczema [^c9fb49ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1 AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is based on the idea that combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH (to reduce the principal symptom of itch) might magnify or intensify the effect of treatment. Also, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as topical treatment is the standard management for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment in adults and children with eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional treatment as add-on therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were 'Mean change in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema' and 'Proportion of participants reporting adverse effects and serious adverse events'. Secondary outcomes were 'Mean change in physician-assessed clinical signs', 'Mean change in quality of life', and 'Number of eczema flares'.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (3285 randomised participants). Seventeen studies included 1344 adults, and eight studies included 1941 children. Most studies failed to report eczema severity at baseline, but they were conducted in secondary care settings, so it is likely that they recruited patients with more severe cases of eczema. Trial duration was between three days and 18 months. Researchers studied 13 different H1 AH treatments. We could not undertake pooling because of the high level of diversity across studies in terms of duration and dose of intervention, concomitant topical therapy, and outcome assessment. Risk of bias was generally unclear, but five studies had high risk of bias in one domain (attrition, selection, or reporting bias). Only one study measured quality of life, but these results were insufficient for statistical analysis. Although this review assessed 17 comparisons, we summarise here the results of three key comparisons in this review. Cetirizine versus placeboOne study compared cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg/d against placebo over 18 months in 795 children. Study authors did not report patient-assessed symptoms of eczema separately for pruritus. Cetirizine is probably associated with fewer adverse events (mainly mild) (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.01) and the need for slightly less additional H1 AH use as an indication of eczema flare rate (P = 0.035; no further numerical data given). Physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD)) were reduced in both groups, but the difference between groups was reported as non-significant (no P value given). Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. One study assessed cetirizine 10 mg/d against placebo over four weeks in 84 adults. Results show no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema (pruritus measured as part of SCORAD; no numerical data given), numbers of adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45; mainly sedation, other skin-related problems, respiratory symptoms, or headache), or physician-assessed changes in clinical signs, amount of local rescue therapy required, or number of applications as an indicator of eczema flares (no numerical data reported). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Fexofenadine versus placeboCompared with placebo, fexofenadine 120 mg/d taken in adults over one week (one study) probably leads to a small reduction in patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus on a scale of 0 to 8 (mean difference (MD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.07; n = 400) and a greater reduction in the ratio of physician-assessed pruritus area to whole body surface area (P = 0.007; no further numerical data given); however, these reductions may not be clinically meaningful. Results suggest probably little or no difference in adverse events (mostly somnolence and headache) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50; n = 411) nor in the amount of 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate used (co-intervention in both groups) as an indicator of eczema flare, but no numerical data were given. Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. Loratadine versus placeboA study of 28 adults compared loratadine 10 mg/d taken over 4 weeks versus placebo. Researchers found no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed pruritus, measured by a 100-point visual analogue scale (MD -2.30, 95% CI -20.27 to 15.67); reduction in physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORAD) (MD -4.10, 95% CI -13.22 to 5.02); or adverse events. Study authors reported only one side effect (folliculitis with placebo) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.76). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Number of eczema flares was not measured for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the main comparisons, we did not find consistent evidence that H1 AH treatments are effective as 'add-on' therapy for eczema when compared to placebo; evidence for this comparison was of low and moderate quality. However, fexofenadine probably leads to a small improvement in patient-assessed pruritus, with probably no significant difference in the amount of treatment used to prevent eczema flares. Cetirizine was no better than placebo in terms of physician-assessed clinical signs nor patient-assessed symptoms, and we found no evidence that loratadine was more beneficial than placebo, although all interventions seem safe. The quality of evidence was limited because of poor study design and imprecise results. Future researchers should clearly define the condition (course and severity) and clearly report their methods, especially participant selection and randomisation; baseline characteristics; and outcomes (based on the Harmonising Outcome Measures in Eczema initiative).

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines 2023: highlights [^9f5fc744]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, with a complex pathogenesis. It is characterized by eczematous skin lesions, pruritus, and recurrent skin infections and has a negative impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force Atopic Dermatitis Guideline Panel recently released updated AD guidelines. This guideline focuses on addressing clinical questions using trustworthy guideline development standards, including mitigating the potential influence of financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. A multidisciplinary panel used systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform specific recommendations addressing optimal use of topical treatments, dilute bleach bath, dietary avoidance/elimination, allergen immunotherapy, and systemic treatments. The comprehensive recommendations, emphasizing the third principle of evidence-based medicine-that evidence alone is never enough, and that patient values and preferences must be carefully considered when determining optimal treatments for patients and populations-provide a framework to support clinicians in selecting an optimal treatment plan for each patient. This review provides an overview of the guideline and discusses how those recommendations relate to current practice.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^077ffc80]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^9231b1e7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis guideline — scope states that this guideline addresses the treatment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) of all severities and that the treatment of other forms of eczematous dermatitis is outside the scope of this document. Recommendations on AD management are subdivided into 4 sections to update and expand on the clinical information and recommendations previously published in 2004. This document is the final in the series of 4 publications and discusses the management and control of AD flares using topical modalities and the utility and timing of allergen testing and avoidance, and also discusses the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, such as environmental, dietary, and educational interventions, in addition to complementary therapies.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2010–11 [^cb370f60]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

This review provides a summary of key findings from 24 systematic reviews of atopic eczema (AE) published or indexed between 1 August 2010 and 31 December 2011, updating published summaries from previous years. Epidemiological evidence points to the protective effects of early daycare, endotoxin exposure, consumption of unpasteurized milk, and early exposure to dogs, but antibiotic use in early life may increase the risk for AE. With regard to prevention of AE, there is currently no strong evidence of benefit for exclusive breastfeeding, hydrolysed protein formulas, soy formulas, maternal antigen avoidance, omega-3 or omega-6 fatty-acid supplementation, or use of prebiotics or probiotics. With respect to AE treatments, the most compelling new systematic review evidence was for proactive treatment with topical anti-inflammatory agents (topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors) for the prevention of AE flares in patients with moderate to severe AE. A meta-analysis of 4 trials confirmed the superiority of tacrolimus 0.1% over pimecrolimus for the treatment of AE, and a review of 17 trials found that tacrolimus (0.1% or 0.03%) was broadly similar in efficacy to mild/moderate topical corticosteroids. Evidence for the role of education in the management of AE was less conclusive, with evidence from randomized controlled trials showing mixed results. Further work is needed in this area to conduct high-quality trials of educational interventions that are clearly described and reproducible. There is no clear evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy, botanical extracts or Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of AE, as large well-designed trials are lacking in these areas.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

### Long-term control of atopic dermatitis with platelet-rich plasma [^e6b8d9b8]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

PRP has a wide variety of medical applications. It is currently being used and studied for the repair of tendons, bones, cartilages, and muscles.PRP has also made its way into esthetic medicine and the treatment of various dermatologic conditions, including wound healing, acne scar correction, alopecia management, and skin rejuvenation, to name a few. It has also been shown to have a positive effect in improving infraorbital dark circles and nasolabial folds, which supported the decision for its use in this case. Incidentally, however, this led to a relief of the dermatitis symptoms for the patient. Furthermore, it was observed that with the repeated use of PRP, the symptoms gradually reduced and eventually resolved for extended periods of time.

A review of the literature in Excerpta Medica Database, Ovid MEDLARS Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature libraries using the key words "platelet-rich plasma", "platelet-rich fibrin matrix", "atopic dermatitis", and "eczema" was conducted with no restrictions on study date or design. This did not reveal any related studies. Further search on Google Scholar revealed only 1 other case report by Ghani et al, describing the cases of 2 patients whose eczema improved over 1 month with 3 PRP sessions. However, treatment results past the 1-month mark were not provided. Therefore, to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the long-term outcomes of PRP therapy for treating dermatitis.

Based on our results and those of other studies, there is an indication for the potential use of PRP in the management of AD and other types of eczema. Two years of symptom relief is unprecedented. A randomized clinical trial with a greater number of participants is warranted to rigorously evaluate the seemingly positive effects of PRP in treating skin eczema, including AD. Further research may also shed more light on the pathophysiology of AD as well as the biochemical pathways through which PRP can exert its therapeutic effects.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^c595d9ed]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) systemic and phototherapy guideline — clinical questions, outcomes, and study scope are defined as follows: The clinical questions address the "efficacy and safety of systemic immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and antihistamine agents for the treatment of AD", the "efficacy and safety of phototherapy or photochemotherapy for the treatment of AD", the "comparative efficacy and safety of individual systemic therapies for the treatment of AD", and the "efficacy and safety of combination therapies including a systemic agent for the treatment of AD". Outcomes of interest include efficacy outcomes of "Change in clinical signs/symptoms of disease as assessed by a clinician" and "Prevention of flares"; safety outcomes of "Serious adverse events", "Withdrawal due to adverse events", and "Infection"; and patient-reported outcomes of "Change in patient-reported signs/symptoms", "Change in quality of life", and "Change in itch severity". The scope specifies a population of "Adults (≥ 18 y of age) with a clinical diagnosis of AD (including "eczema" or "atopic eczema")" while excluding "Immunocompromised patients, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, varicose eczema, discoid eczema; infected AD". Included interventions are "Systemic therapies or phototherapy/photo chemotherapy interventions available and approved for use (for any indication) in the US", excluding "Treatments not available or approved for use (for any indication) in the US". Eligible study designs are "Published RCTs in which study participants are investigated (inter-individual, parallel-arm trials)" with exclusions of "Unpublished research, observational studies, case series, case reports, modeling studies, narrative reviews".

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) [^cca28cce]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other Potential Consequences of Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis can decrease quality of life, reduce productivity at work and school, and increase health care costs. Triggers for flare-ups vary among individuals and may include physical or emotional stress, changes in temperature or humidity, sweating, allergens, and irritants. Nonmedication Treatments to Manage Atopic Dermatitis Patients with atopic dermatitis should receive education about how to identify and limit exposure to triggers. They should also be encouraged to bathe daily, use soap-free cleansers, and apply fragrance-free and irritant-free moisturizer directly after bathing. Medications to Treat Atopic Dermatitis. Although there is no cure for atopic dermatitis, medications that regulate inflammation and immune system activity can improve or resolve symptoms that are not well controlled with the nonmedication treatments listed above.

For mild or moderate atopic dermatitis, first-line treatment is topical anti-inflammatory ointments and creams, including topical corticosteroids, which are available in a wide range of potencies. Other topical medications include calcineurin inhibitors, a topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, and topical Janus kinase inhibitors.

For patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, or for those whose condition does not improve with topical medications, treatment may include biologic therapy, which is injected into the skin, oral Janus kinase inhibitors, phototherapy, and oral immunomodulators. Use of multiple agents may be required for long-term control of more severe cases. Selection of treatment requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits of these therapies, and ongoing laboratory monitoring may be required.

### 'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn' T die': a qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to eczema and implications for self-care [^e759e1e3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Young people with eczema experienced similar challenges and stressors to young people with other long‐term conditions, especially when the condition posed a threat to their social identity. 25, 26 Over time, for some young people this led to benefit finding, a key behavioural response where the individual tries to identify a positive perspective in a situation. 9 Many young people shift from perceiving this struggle of being different to strengthening their self‐confidence.

These findings concur with research regarding adaptation to long‐term conditions. The unified theory postulates that acceptance is an important factor to successful adjustment, and that coping through wishful thinking leads to adjustment difficulties. 9 Our findings suggest that young people's acceptance of eczema, and their hope that it will go away, are in conflict with each other. They tend to know there is no cure for eczema but continued to hope it would go away. In a review of qualitative work with children and young people with long‐term conditions, there were similar themes of striving for acceptance and adjusting with everyday treatment regimens as part of their everyday lives. 26 For example, children with asthma eventually accept suboptimal control through striving to feel 'normal' 27 When young people refer to having a condition as their norm, it is because they are shifting from comparing themselves with their peers, to comparing with their own experiences of the condition. They compare the now self with their past self with the same symptoms. 28

Table V. Disease severity and quality-of-life assessment in atopic dermatitis (AD) — For the general management of patients with AD, available disease severity measurement scales are not recommended for routine clinical practice and available patient quality of life measurement scales are not recommended for routine clinical practice; instead, it is recommended that clinicians ask general questions about itch, sleep, impact on daily activity, and persistence of disease, using currently available scales mainly when practical.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2017. part 1: treatment and prevention [^4ffe6e81]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 25 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2017, and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. There is high-quality evidence to demonstrate that dupilumab is better than placebo for the treatment of AE, is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and does not increase the risk of infection compared with placebo; however, comparison studies with other systemic treatments are necessary. Topical tofacitinib is a promising treatment for mild-moderate AE, but currently lacks sufficient evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing with other active treatments. Topical doxepin may be effective for pruritus in AE, but available studies have short follow-up periods and longer-term outcomes are needed. Bleach baths were no more effective than water baths alone at reducing AE severity. Topical antibiotics cannot be recommended for infected AE, owing to insufficient evidence of benefit. There is little comparison of different emollients in RCTs, but overall evidence indicates that they reduce AE severity, are steroid-sparing and lead to better outcomes in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) than TCS alone. No clear benefit was demonstrated for vitamin D/C/E supplementation in pregnancy for eczema prevention.

### Educational and psychological interventions for managing atopic dermatitis (eczema) [^0af5bfd6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (eczema), can have a significant impact on well-being and quality of life for affected people and their families. Standard treatment is avoidance of triggers or irritants and regular application of emollients and topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Thorough physical and psychological assessment is central to good-quality treatment. Overcoming barriers to provision of holistic treatment in dermatological practice is dependent on evaluation of the efficacy and economics of both psychological and educational interventions in this participant group. This review is based on a previous Cochrane review published in 2014, and now includes adults as well as children.

Objectives

To assess the clinical outcomes of educational and psychological interventions in children and adults with atopic dermatitis (eczema) and to summarise the availability and principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO and two trials registers up to March 2023. We checked the reference lists of included studies and related systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. We searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE and Embase for economic evaluations on 8 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, cluster-randomised and cross-over RCTs that assess educational and psychological interventions for treating eczema in children and adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes were reduction in disease severity, as measured by clinical signs, patient-reported symptoms and improvement in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measures. Secondary outcomes were improvement in long-term control of symptoms, improvement in psychological well-being, improvement in standard treatment concordance and adverse events. We assessed short- (up to 16 weeks after treatment) and long-term time points (more than 16 weeks).

Main Results

We included 37 trials (6170 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (34/37), in outpatient settings (25/37). We judged three trials to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifteen trials had a high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to bias in measurement of the outcome. Trials assessed interventions compared to standard care. Individual educational interventions may reduce short-term clinical signs (measured by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD); mean difference (MD) -5.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.39 to -2.01; 1 trial, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) but patient-reported symptoms, HRQoL, long-term eczema control and psychological well-being were not reported. Group education interventions probably reduce clinical signs (SCORAD) both in the short term (MD -9.66, 95% CI -19.04 to -0.29; 3 studies, 731 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and the long term (MD -7.22, 95% CI -11.01 to -3.43; 3 studies, 1424 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably reduce long-term patient-reported symptoms (SMD -0.47 95% CI -0.60 to -0.33; 2 studies, 908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may slightly improve short-term HRQoL (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.01; 4 studies, 746 participants; low-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to short-term psychological well-being (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); MD -2.47, 95% CI -5.16 to 0.22; 1 study, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). Long-term eczema control was not reported. We don't know whether technology-mediated educational interventions could improve short-term clinical signs (SCORAD; 1 study; 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence). They may have little or no effect on short-term patient-reported symptoms (Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM); MD -0.76, 95% CI -1.84 to 0.33; 2 studies; 195 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably have little or no effect on short-term HRQoL (MD 0, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 2 studies, 430 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Technology-mediated education interventions probably slightly improve long-term eczema control (Recap of atopic eczema (RECAP); MD -1.5, 95% CI -3.13 to 0.13; 1 study, 232 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may improve short-term psychological well-being (MD -1.78, 95% CI -2.13 to -1.43; 1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence). Habit reversal treatment may reduce short-term clinical signs (SCORAD; MD -6.57, 95% CI -13.04 to -0.1; 1 study, 33 participants; low-certainty evidence) but we are uncertain about any effects on short-term HRQoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI); 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Patient-reported symptoms, long-term eczema control and psychological well-being were not reported. We are uncertain whether arousal reduction therapy interventions could improve short-term clinical signs (Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); 1 study, 24 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or patient-reported symptoms (visual analogue scale (VAS); 1 study, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Arousal reduction therapy may improve short-term HRQoL (Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI); MD -2.1, 95% CI -4.41 to 0.21; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence) and psychological well-being (PSS; MD -1.2, 95% CI -3.38 to 0.98; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). Long-term eczema control was not reported. No studies reported standard care compared with self-help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education; or adverse events. We identified two health economic studies. One found that a 12-week, technology-mediated, educational-support programme may be cost neutral. The other found that a nurse practitioner group-education intervention may have lower costs than standard care provided by a dermatologist, with comparable effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

In-person, individual education, as an adjunct to conventional topical therapy, may reduce short-term eczema signs compared to standard care, but there is no information on eczema symptoms, quality of life or long-term outcomes. Group education probably reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the long term and may also improve quality of life in the short term. Favourable effects were also reported for technology-mediated education, habit reversal treatment and arousal reduction therapy. All favourable effects are of uncertain clinical significance, since they may not exceed the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcome measures used (MCID 8.7 points for SCORAD, 3.4 points for POEM). We found no trials of self-help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education. Future trials should include more diverse populations, address shared priorities, evaluate long-term outcomes and ensure patients are involved in trial design.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^04928447]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first-line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician-reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main Results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty-five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data. Stronger-potency versus weaker-potency topical corticosteroids Sixty-three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician-reported signs of eczema. We pooled four trials that compared moderate- versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate-potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence). Twice daily or more versus once daily application We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks. Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare-up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher-potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low-certainty evidence. Longer versus shorter-term duration of application for induction of remission No trials were identified. Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare-ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe). Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty. Other comparisons Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare-ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare-ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low- or very low-certainty, short-term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer-term trials, in people with mild eczema.
