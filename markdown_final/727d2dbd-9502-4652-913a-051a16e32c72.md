## Question

Nf 1 prognosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about NF1 prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline epidemiology and mortality. Then, I should verify the major drivers of excess mortality, especially malignancy. Next, I will examine morbidity and multisystem complications, followed by quality of life and mental health. After that, I need to assess key prognostic modifiers, including genotype, tumor burden, age, and sex. I will then review how modern surveillance and therapies modify prognosis and where access to care shifts outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize an overall prognosis statement with practical clinical takeaways and acknowledge evidence gaps, anchoring the discussion in population-level data and consensus guidance [^115q44ax] [^114XrFfY].

> Let me first confirm the baseline epidemiology and mortality framework because this sets the context for prognosis. NF1 affects roughly 1 in 2,500 to 3,000 individuals, with contemporary estimates around 21.3 per 100,000 in Europe and worldwide, underscoring its frequency among monogenic disorders [^115UaA3p] [^111wiqC4]. I should double-check life expectancy estimates: multiple sources converge on a reduction of approximately 8–15 years, with a well-described UK regional cohort reporting a median survival of 71.5 years and an average 8-year reduction versus the background population, while a large French nationwide in-hospital cohort shows a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) around 4.1, reinforcing substantially elevated mortality risk across ages, particularly in youth and women [^1126bTkS] [^115q44ax] [^114XrFfY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality yet; these are descriptive metrics that need linkage to specific drivers of mortality and morbidity before inferring modifiable risk [^115q44ax].

> I will now examine the leading contributors to excess mortality, and I need to ensure malignancy patterns are characterized precisely. Wait, let me verify the standardized incidence ratios: in a population-based Finnish series, the SIR for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) was 2,056, and for CNS tumors 37.5, with corresponding elevated SMRs, establishing these as dominant cancer threats in NF1 and key determinants of survival, particularly MPNST which carries poor outcomes and often later-stage detection in NF1 [^1112auLr] [^112QM41Z]. I should also check breast cancer risk and survival because they meaningfully alter female prognosis; women with NF1 under 40 have an approximately 11-fold increased incidence, and unscreened NF1 cohorts exhibit markedly worse 10-year survival than screened non-NF populations, highlighting screening's impact on outcomes and the urgency of age-appropriate surveillance strategies [^1112auLr] [^114vKymi]. But wait, what if non-nervous system cancers contribute broadly as well; the aggregate lifetime cancer risk in NF1 approaches 60%, with a median cancer diagnosis age near 39 years, which compresses the window for early detection and intervention compared to the general population [^115q44ax] [^1112auLr].

> Next, I should review the morbidity landscape because prognosis is not only about survival. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) occur in roughly 40–60% of individuals, often before clinical detection without whole-body MRI, carry substantial surgical and functional morbidity, and confer increased risk for malignant transformation through atypical intermediates, shaping both quality of life and cancer risk trajectories [^112QEmhz]. Let me verify pediatric outcomes specifically: symptomatic pediatric PNFs are associated with higher mortality relative to peers without or with asymptomatic PNFs and require repeated surgeries with location-dependent recurrence and complication profiles, particularly in the head, neck, and thorax, which map to higher morbidity burdens over time [^113Qf1en]. Hold on, I should confirm the quantitative link to MPNST risk: internal PNFs are the strongest predictor of MPNST emergence, with markedly elevated odds compared to those without internal tumors, and the presence of subcutaneous neurofibromas correlates with internal PNFs and MPNST, suggesting tumor burden and distribution as practical risk stratifiers in clinic [^111TVNLk]. I need to also remember vascular and pulmonary complications that influence functional prognosis and perioperative risk, including moyamoya arteriopathy in children and cystic lung disease with spontaneous pneumothorax in some adults, which can be morbid or lethal without targeted management [^1158D9tg] [^113wdqje].

> Now, I will consider quality of life and mental health because these domains materially shape the lived prognosis. Systematic reviews show adults with NF1 report lower global QoL than population norms, with disease visibility and severity impacting skin-specific QoL, and similar trends occur in pediatric populations where parents often rate QoL lower than children, indicating family-level distress that may affect care engagement and outcomes [^1121z5sg] [^1131qsqc]. Let me think about psychiatric comorbidity because it often drives functioning and utilization: rates of depression up to roughly 55% and clinically significant anxiety around 15% are reported, and visibility of cutaneous disease links to psychiatric morbidity, arguing for proactive mental health screening and interventions integrated within NF1 care pathways [^114hqksa]. I should confirm that these psychosocial burdens persist even when tumors are technically benign, reinforcing that prognosis must encompass symptom relief, appearance-related distress, and function alongside oncologic endpoints [^1121z5sg].

> I need to check key prognostic modifiers to refine risk stratification. Genetically, NF1 microdeletions confer higher tumor burden and substantially elevated MPNST risk with earlier onset, and whole-gene deletions associate with high tumor burden and growth rates, whereas some variants, like p. Arg1809, predict a milder cutaneous phenotype, illustrating that genotype can calibrate surveillance intensity even where correlations are generally modest [^113A3jER] [^115o1Vh2] [^115BuqzP]. Hold on, I should verify other high-risk genotypes; emerging data suggest missense mutations affecting codons 844–848 track with more severe phenotypes, including early malignancy presentations in small series, though broader validation is needed before routine prognostic use [^114N7RwA]. Let me reconsider tumor burden markers: internal PNFs remain the strongest clinical predictor of MPNST, while subcutaneous neurofibromas mark elevated odds of internal tumor burden, aligning surveillance imaging with phenotypic flags in practice [^111TVNLk]. Demographically, age strongly modifies risk, with exceptionally high SIRs for cancer in children and adolescents and a distinct early-onset breast cancer signal in women, whereas some older cohort data suggest sex-related differences in aggregate malignancy risk, requiring individualized pathways for pediatric and young adult surveillance, especially in females [^1112auLr] [^115kfu2Q].

> Next, I should review modern surveillance and therapeutic advances because they are actively shifting prognosis. ERN-GENTURIS guidance recommends longitudinal, age-tailored surveillance with clinical vigilance for MPNST warning signs, consideration of whole-body MRI to quantify internal tumor burden, and prompt evaluation of lesions with concerning features, while emphasizing multidisciplinary care across the lifespan to improve outcomes [^115q44ax] [^112QEmhz] [^116znBr6]. Let me verify imaging strategies for malignant transformation risk: combined regional MRI and FDG-PET is useful when transformation is suspected, and in higher-risk, asymptomatic adults, whole-body FDG-PET/MRI screening identified MPNSTs in about 5% of screened individuals, suggesting a role for selective, risk-adapted imaging in expert centers with appropriate pathways to biopsy and surgical management [^116znBr6] [^1123xVn2]. I should confirm treatment implications: MEK inhibitors provide clinically meaningful shrinkage and symptom control for inoperable, symptomatic PNFs by targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway, and for MPNST, complete surgical excision with broad margins remains the cornerstone, underscoring the need for early detection to preserve resectability and survival [^1148EW8X] [^1119HDPh] [^111M5a9u].

> I need to ensure I fairly assess system-level and access-related modifiers of prognosis. Wait, I initially thought an observational study showed a 14.7-year survival improvement for NF1 after genetic register implementation, but let me correct that: the 14.7-year figure pertains to NF2 in that dataset; while the study confirms reduced life expectancy for NF1, it does not quantify a 14.7-year gain for NF1 specifically, though it supports the broader principle that structured registries and coordinated surveillance can improve outcomes across hereditary tumor syndromes [^111wQreG]. I should double-check direct evidence of surveillance impact within NF1: breast screening within organized programs is associated with dramatically improved outcomes in NF1 cohorts compared to unscreened groups, with a notable absence of breast cancer deaths in one screened series, highlighting how dedicated pathways can alter disease-specific survival in NF1 [^114vKymi]. Let me also remember that access to multidisciplinary NF clinics and guideline-based tumor surveillance is uneven internationally, which plausibly widens outcome disparities even when individual risk is similar on a genetic basis [^115q44ax].

> I will now synthesize an overall prognosis statement, but I need to be precise about the weight of evidence. Life expectancy in NF1 is reduced by roughly 8–15 years, with contemporary regional cohort data centering near an 8-year decrement and median survival around 71.5 years in some populations, although national data show an approximately 4-fold mortality elevation versus the general population across hospital cohorts, which likely over-represent more severe disease [^1126bTkS] [^114XrFfY]. The lifetime cancer risk approximates 60% with substantially earlier median age at diagnosis, and MPNST remains the pivotal determinant of shortened survival, while CNS tumors and early-onset breast cancer contribute materially to excess mortality, particularly in younger females, reinforcing the necessity of age-adapted vigilance and rapid escalation when red flags arise [^115q44ax] [^1112auLr]. Prognosis is heterogeneous; worse trajectories cluster with NF1 microdeletions or whole-gene deletions, substantial internal plexiform tumor burden, subcutaneous neurofibromas marking internal disease, and earlier age at tumor onset, whereas advances in surveillance imaging, MEK inhibition for PNFs, and timely definitive surgery for MPNST are improving trajectories, especially within experienced centers [^113A3jER] [^115o1Vh2] [^111TVNLk] [^1119HDPh] [^112QEmhz].

> Hold on, I should translate this into practical, clinic-facing guidance with risk-stratified actions. I need to ensure patients and families understand red flags for MPNST transformation, including rapid tumor growth, new persistent pain, new motor weakness, sensory changes, sphincter disturbance, dysphagia, dyspnea, or change in tumor consistency, which warrant urgent imaging with regional MRI and consideration of FDG-PET and biopsy in expert hands to preserve resectability and survival [^116znBr6] [^112QEmhz]. Let me verify counseling points on mental health and QoL, since these influence adherence and outcomes: routine screening for depression and anxiety, addressing appearance-related distress from cutaneous neurofibromas, and facilitating access to psychosocial care are essential components of prognostic care plans, not adjuncts, given their prevalence and impact on functioning in NF1 across the lifespan [^1121z5sg] [^114hqksa]. I should also confirm reproductive counseling options and timing, including the role of preimplantation genetic testing for NF1, which is feasible and informs family planning in affected couples, ideally integrated early due to age-related fertility considerations and the need for known familial variants in many cases [^115XQBxA] [^113RcGbG].

---

NF1 prognosis is highly variable [^112ekFAD], with a **reduced life expectancy** of about 8–15 years [^115q44ax], largely due to malignancies and cardiovascular disease [^117RQtMP]. The **lifetime cancer risk** is ~60% [^1112auLr], with a 10–13% risk of MPNST — the main cause of early mortality [^116znBr6]. Most patients develop benign tumors and cutaneous features that affect quality of life [^1121z5sg]; however, severe complications are unpredictable [^115BuqzP]. Prognosis is **worse with NF1 microdeletions** [^113A3jER], symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas [^113Qf1en], or a high tumor burden. Early detection, multidisciplinary care [^115q44ax], and targeted therapies (e.g. MEK inhibitors) [^1148EW8X] can improve outcomes [^1119HDPh]; however, overall survival remains lower than in the general population [^1126bTkS].

---

## Clinical variability and disease course

NF1 shows marked **clinical variability** [^115BuqzP], even within families, which makes prognosis unpredictable [^112ekFAD]. Common features include:

- **Cutaneous manifestations**: Café-au-lait macules, axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and dermal neurofibromas [^1155d1UX].
- **Tumor development**: Plexiform neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [^112QEmhz].
- **Skeletal abnormalities**: Scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and other bone deformities [^112ekFAD].
- **Neurological complications**: Learning disabilities, attention deficits, seizures, and peripheral neuropathies [^11246tt4].

The disease course is **progressive** [^112ekFAD], with new manifestations emerging over time; therefore, lifelong monitoring and management are required [^112dgKqX].

---

## Tumor-related prognosis

Tumor development **significantly influences prognosis** in NF1 [^115q44ax]. The most critical tumors include:

| **Tumor type** | **Lifetime risk** | **Prognostic impact** |
|-|-|-|
| Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) | 10–13% | - Poor prognosis <br/> - Major cause of reduced life expectancy [^1112auLr] [^113A3jER] |
| Optic pathway gliomas | 15–20% | - Variable prognosis <br/> - Often indolent but can cause vision loss [^112ekFAD] |
| Plexiform neurofibromas | 30–50% | Benign but can cause significant morbidity and disfigurement [^112ekFAD] |

---

MPNSTs are **particularly aggressive** [^112QM41Z], with a five-year survival rate of approximately 20–50%, significantly contributing to reduced life expectancy in NF1 patients [^1126bTkS].

---

## Life expectancy and mortality

NF1 is associated with a **reduced life expectancy** compared with the general population [^111wQreG], with studies indicating an average reduction of 8–15 years [^115q44ax], primarily due to malignancies (especially MPNSTs) and cardiovascular complications. Median survival for NF1 patients is around 71.5 years [^1126bTkS], compared to 80 years in the general population.

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **influence prognosis** in NF1:

- **Genetic factors**: Specific mutations, such as NF1 microdeletions [^113A3jER], are associated with more severe phenotypes and higher tumor burden.
- **Clinical factors**: Presence of symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas [^113Qf1en], optic pathway gliomas [^112ekFAD], and cardiovascular complications [^117RQtMP] worsen prognosis.
- **Environmental factors**: Exposure to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents increases the risk of secondary malignancies.

---

## Quality of life and psychosocial impact

NF1 significantly affects **quality of life** [^1121z5sg] because of visible tumors, chronic pain, neurological complications, and psychological distress. Patients often experience anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced self-esteem, underscoring the need for comprehensive psychosocial support and counseling [^1112sdw7].

---

## Current management strategies

Management of NF1 centers on **early detection**, regular surveillance, and **multidisciplinary care** [^115q44ax]:

- **Regular surveillance**: Annual clinical assessments [^112dgKqX], MRI imaging, and ophthalmologic evaluations to detect tumors and complications early [^112ekFAD].
- **Surgical interventions**: Resection of symptomatic tumors, particularly plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs [^1145wWgq] [^112ekFAD].
- **Pharmacological treatments**: MEK inhibitors (e.g. selumetinib) [^1119HDPh] have shown efficacy in reducing plexiform neurofibroma size and improving symptoms [^1148EW8X].
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for family planning and understanding inheritance patterns [^113hryFx] [^115TxojY].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include the development of **targeted therapies** (e.g. MEK inhibitors) [^1119HDPh] and improved genetic testing methods [^111QXbve], which enhance early diagnosis and enable more personalized treatment strategies [^1148EW8X]. Ongoing research aims to identify additional therapeutic targets and improve long-term outcomes for NF1 patients [^111pYxDS].

---

NF1 has a highly variable prognosis with a **reduced life expectancy** driven by malignancies and cardiovascular complications. Prognosis is shaped by genetic, clinical, and environmental factors, and **management requires a multidisciplinary approach** [^115q44ax]. Recent advances in targeted therapies and genetic testing offer hope for improved outcomes [^1148EW8X] [^111QXbve].

### Pediatric plexiform neurofibromas: Impact on morbidity and mortality in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113Qf1en]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To characterize morbidity, mortality, and surgical outcomes in pediatric patients with symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from clinical records at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 1997 and 2007. This study focused on the surgical history and other neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related complications in children with PNFs.

A total of 154 children with NF1 and PNFs were identified.

- **Results**: Children with symptomatic PNFs showed an increased incidence of other NF1-related tumors (P < .05) and a higher mortality rate (5/154, 3.2%) compared to patients without or with asymptomatic PNFs (2/366, 0.5%; p = 0.024). The most common morbidities leading to surgeries included neurologic, disfigurement, orthopedic, and airway complaints. Less extensive resection was associated with a shorter interval to a second surgery (P < .0019), while the highest recurrence was noted in tumors located in the head, neck, and thorax (P < .001).

These findings highlight the increased risk for additional tumors and mortality associated with symptomatic PNFs. Surgical interventions were frequently required and sometimes resulted in additional morbidity. Patients with PNFs were more likely to benefit from surgery when the indications included airway compression or disfigurement.

### The use of MEK inhibitors in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors and management of toxicities [^1148EW8X]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals at birth. NF1 is associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including café-au-lait macules, axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, skeletal abnormalities, and learning disabilities. Individuals with NF1 are at risk for developing both benign and malignant tumors throughout their lifetime, with the most common neoplasms being cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), and optic pathway or other low-grade gliomas. Although some tumors in NF1 are associated with few to no symptoms, others can have a significant impact on an individual's appearance and/or function. NF1 is caused by the loss of neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin is a Ras-GAP protein that acts as a negative regulator of RAS signaling.

Loss of functional neurofibromin results in the activation of the classic RAS-MAPK signaling cascade, leading to cell proliferation and subsequent tumor formation. NF1 is a classic tumor suppressor disorder, with tumor cells demonstrating biallelic loss of the functional NF1 gene. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/MEK2) is a kinase in the RAS-MAPK pathway, which phosphorylates and activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Overactivation of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade has been implicated in the development of a number of malignancies; perhaps the most well-known is melanoma. In melanoma, inhibition of the signaling pathway components RAF and MEK results in improved outcomes.

### Elevated risk for MPNST in NF1 microdeletion patients [^113A3jER]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

An NF1 microdeletion is the single most commonly reported mutation in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Individuals with an NF1 microdeletion have, as a group, more neurofibromas at a younger age than the group of all individuals with NF1. We report that NF1 microdeletion individuals additionally have a substantially higher lifetime risk for the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors than individuals with NF1 who do not have an NF1 microdeletion. This should be taken into account in the medical follow-up of individuals with an NF1 microdeletion.

### Mortality in neurofibromatosis 1: in North West England: an assessment of actuarial survival in a region of the UK since 1989 [^1126bTkS]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a comparatively common autosomal dominant disorder. However, relatively few studies have assessed lifetime risk, and information about the effect of NF1 on mortality remains uncertain. NF1 patients were identified using the North West Regional Family Genetic Register, which covers the 4.1 million people living in North West England, including the regions of Greater Manchester, Cheshire, and Cumbria. Data relating to tumors and malignancies were obtained from the North West Cancer Intelligence Service. Death data for the general North West population were obtained from the Office of National Statistics.

We identified 1,186 individuals with NF1, of whom 1,023 lived within the strict regional boundaries (constituting a region of North West England bound by the Pennines to the east and the Irish Sea to the west, but excluding the conurbation of Liverpool (Merseyside) and the Wirral Peninsula) and 131 had died. MPNST and glioma were found to be the two most common causes of reduced life expectancy among NF1 patients. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the median survival for NF1 patients was shown to be 71.5 years, with women living approximately 7.4 years longer than men. On average, both men and women lived around 8 years less than their counterparts in the general population.

The reduction in life expectancy for NF1 patients was found to be much lower (8 years) than the previously estimated 15-year decrease. Limitations relating to the underreporting of NF1 on death certificates were once again highlighted and should be considered in future investigations.

### Distinctive cancer associations in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1112auLr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The study was designed to determine the risk of cancer in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) by cancer type, age, and sex, with unprecedented accuracy achieved by combining two total population-based registers.

A population-based series of patients with NF1 (N = 1,404; 19,076 person-years) was linked to incident cancers recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry and deaths recorded in the national Population Register Centre between 1987 and 2012. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for selected cancer types. The survival of patients with cancer, both with and without NF1, was compared.

In malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and CNS tumors, cancers traditionally associated with NF1, we observed SIRs of 2,056 (95% CI, 1,561 to 2,658) and 37.5 (95% CI, 30.2 to 46.0), respectively, and SMRs of 2,301 (95% CI, 1,652 to 3,122) and 30.2 (95% CI, 19.1 to 45.2), respectively. We found an unequivocally increased risk for breast cancer. SIR was 11.1 (95% CI, 5.56 to 19.5) for breast cancer in women with NF1 aged < 40 years, and the overall SMR for breast cancer was 5.20 (95% CI, 2.38 to 9.88). Particularly high overall SIRs were observed in patients with NF1 aged < 15 years: women, 87.6 (95% CI, 58.6 to 125); men, 45.6 (95% CI, 28.4 to 68.5). An estimated lifetime cancer risk for patients with NF1 was 59.6%. The 5-year survival of patients with cancer and NF1, excluding nervous tissue cancers, was worse than comparable patients with cancers without NF1.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112QEmhz]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Plexiform neurofibromas are benign, diffuse, or nodular growing tumors of the nerve sheath arising in approximately 40–60% of patients with NF1, depending on the use of WB-MRI to identify clinically undetectable plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas involving the eyelid, orbit, and periorbital structures have been labeled orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas and have an incidence of less than 10% in children with NF1. Orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas frequently cause vision loss secondary to deprivational or anisometropic amblyopia as well as glaucoma. They usually cause aesthetic disfigurement and functional impairment.

At the transition from childhood to adulthood, brain and WB-MRI is recommended to screen for possible brain tumors and to evaluate the internal plexiform neurofibroma tumor burden, respectively. Surgery should be considered for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas, and increased monitoring is recommended. For symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1, MEK inhibitors may be considered. Plexiform neurofibromas are associated with an increased risk for malignant transformation to MPNSTs, and an intermediate (premalignant) stage between plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs exists, called ANNUBP. Almost half of the ANNUBPs are palpable lesions and about 80% cause clinical symptoms. In case of a suspected ANNUBP or MPNST, primary resection is recommended if safe and feasible. Otherwise, radiologic interventions should be pursued.

### Past, present, and future therapeutic strategies for NF-1-associated tumors [^111pYxDS]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with NF-1 can exhibit a diverse array of clinical manifestations. Building on classic NF1/Ras biology, MEK inhibitors are an effective therapy for a number of NF1-related manifestations, yet the heterogeneity and durability of their response motivate the development of additional approaches. Ongoing research into biologic mechanisms and signal transduction pathways dysregulated in NF1-associated tumors holds the potential to reveal additional therapeutic vulnerabilities. Moreover, targeting the tumor microenvironment and employing combination molecular therapies show promise. Continuous investigation through mechanistic investigation, preclinical modeling, clinical trials, the accumulation of long-term safety data, and collaboration between basic scientists and clinicians will be pivotal in advancing therapeutic interventions for NF1-associated tumors.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: From genotype to phenotype [^115BuqzP]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Although neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common Mendelian disorder with autosomal-dominant inheritance, its expression is highly variable and unpredictable. Many NF1 patients have been genotyped, but few allele-phenotype correlations have been identified. NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations are difficult to identify due to the complexity of the NF1 phenotype, its strong age dependency, the relatedness of many clinical features, and the large heterogeneity of pathogenic NF1 mutations. Some NF1 patients with a given NF1 mutation may develop very severe disease, while others with the same mutation have only mild symptoms. This phenotypic variability may be due to both modifier genes and environmental factors. Recent targeted strategies have identified several interesting candidate modifier genes.

### International consensus statement on malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis [^1145wWgq]. Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome in which affected individuals have a greatly increased risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These cancers are difficult to detect and have a poor prognosis. Because patients may present to specialists from widely differing disciplines, the association with NF1 is often not appreciated, and there is no cohesive pattern of care.

A multidisciplinary group of 33 clinicians and scientists with specialist knowledge in MPNST and NF1 reviewed the published and unpublished data in this field and distilled their collective experience to produce a consensus summary on MPNST in NF1. The known clinical, pathological, and genetic information on MPNST in NF1 was collated, and a database was established to record information in a uniform manner. Subgroups with a higher risk of developing MPNST were identified within the NF1 population.

- **Proposals and guidelines**: The consortium formulated proposals and guidelines for clinical and pathological diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment of MPNST in individuals with NF1. A multidisciplinary team approach to the management of this complex disorder is advocated.

- **Progress and collaborative research**: Progress can be made by adopting the guidelines proposed by this consortium and by widespread dissemination of standardized information. Collaborative research should be promoted with the aim of harnessing advances in molecular genetics to develop targeted therapies for MPNST in people with NF1.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112dgKqX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

The goal of tumour surveillance is to detect neoplasms before they become symptomatic, allowing interventions to have a better chance of being curative or preventative of functional impairment. The proposed recommendations for tumour surveillance for NF1 require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach and significant patient commitment. The guidelines apply to all individuals with NF1. Where appropriate, we adapted recommendations to different age groups, individuals with different types of pathogenic variants in NF1, or to pre-existing medical history that might influence risks for a specific tumour type in NF1. Given age-dependent risks, specific recommendations for children versus adults are provided in the guidelines. Furthermore, evidence for age-specific recommendations is based on the underlying patient populations in existing studies, rather than on a clearly defined threshold. We used the terms 'children' or 'childhood' for ages 0–16 years and 'adults' or 'adulthood' for ages 18 and older, with a variable transition from childhood to adulthood between 16 and 18 years as applicable to local health care settings. Finally, we discuss the psychosocial support for people with NF1 during tumour surveillance and management. We tackled the issues of living with the uncertainty of developing a tumour, during monitoring of a tumour, or during and after the treatment of a tumour.

While developing the guideline, gaps requiring further research have been identified. In general, the highly variable course of NF1 is well-recognized, but detailed knowledge on the course of the condition is lacking.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in young children facilitated by means of revised diagnostic criteria including genetic testing for pathogenic NF1 gene variants [^111QXbve]. Human Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of NF1 in young children can be challenging, but revised diagnostic criteria, including genetic testing, may provide assistance. The vast majority of adult patients with NF1 meet the 1988 clinical diagnostic criteria. However, diagnosis may be more difficult in infants or toddlers if they present with isolated café-au-lait macules (CALM) and have no family history of the disease.

Many NF1-associated features are age-dependent. The first symptoms are generally CALM, which may be present at birth or occur in the first year of life, often in the absence of other disease features. Notably, in the first year of life, multiple CALM are present in at least 82% of infants who are later diagnosed with NF1.

- **Additional features**: Axillary and/or inguinal freckling is the second most common feature in NF1, typically appearing in children older than 2–3 years of age. Lisch nodules are frequently observed in adults with NF1, but only 5% of children younger than 3 years possess them. Dermal neurofibromas generally appear during puberty or young adulthood and are rarely detected in children younger than 3 years of age.

- **Revised criteria development**: Of the children with isolated CALM at the initial presentation who are eventually diagnosed with NF1, 76% meet the clinical NIH NF1 criteria by the age of 4 years, 94% meet the criteria by age 6 years, and 97–100% by age 8 years. Nonetheless, approximately 46% of sporadic NF1 cases fail to meet the 1988 clinical diagnostic criteria by the age of.

In conclusion, while traditional diagnostic criteria may suffice for older individuals with more developed symptoms, the integration of genetic testing in revised diagnostic protocols is crucial for early and accurate diagnosis in young children. This approach is likely to improve the clinical management of NF1 in pediatric populations.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 in genetic counseling practice: Recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^113hryFx]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for the genetic counseling of patients and families undergoing evaluation for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or who have received a diagnosis of NF1. These recommendations are the opinions of a multi-center working group of genetic counselors with expertise in the care of individuals with NF1.

These recommendations are based on the committee's clinical experiences, a review of pertinent English language medical articles, and reports of expert committees. They are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. These recommendations do not displace a healthcare provider's professional judgment based on the clinical circumstances of an individual patient.

### Life expectancy in hereditary cancer predisposing diseases: An observational study [^111wQreG]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), and Gorlin syndrome (GS) are single-gene diseases that predispose individuals to early onset tumors. Few studies have assessed the effect of these diseases on life expectancy. This study aimed to assess this effect and test the hypothesis that genetic registers increase survival.

- **Method**: NF1, NF2, VHL, FAP, and GS patients were identified through the North West Regional Genetic Register Service and the North West Cancer Intelligence Service. Information on benign and malignant tumors and deaths was obtained. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to show actuarial survival rates for each disease compared to the local population and in patients diagnosed pre/post the regional genetic register. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) tests were used to compare survival between groups.

- **Results**: Life expectancies were significantly reduced for all diseases investigated compared with the local population (80.0 years) (p = 0.05). GS had the longest life expectancy at 73.4 years, followed by NF1 at 71.5 years, NF2 at 69.0 years, FAP at 63.6 years, and VHL at 52.5 years. Patients diagnosed after the establishment of the genetic register had an increase in survival compared to those diagnosed pre-1990: NF2 (14.7 years), FAP (13.9 years), VHL (16.3 years), and GS (11.2 years).

- **Conclusion**: Life expectancy for all five diseases was less than normal, although in recent years this reached the level of the local population in GS. Although there have been improvements, all conditions remain serious with reduced life expectancies.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis [^11246tt4]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is a multisystem disorder that primarily affects the skin and nervous system, with a population prevalence of 1 in 3500. The condition is often recognized in early childhood due to apparent cutaneous manifestations. Although there is marked clinical variability associated with neurofibromatosis 1, most affected children experience normal growth and development.

Some features of neurofibromatosis 1 are present at birth, while others are age-related abnormalities of tissue proliferation. These necessitate periodic monitoring to address ongoing health and developmental needs and to minimize the risk of serious medical complications.

This clinical report provides a review of:

- **Clinical criteria**: Necessary for establishing a diagnosis.
- **Inheritance pattern**: The genetic transmission of neurofibromatosis 1.
- **Major clinical and developmental manifestations**: Key symptoms and developmental challenges associated with the condition.
- **Guidelines for monitoring and intervention**: Recommendations for maximizing the growth, development, and health of an affected child.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 [^112ekFAD]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous condition with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The complications are diverse, and disease expression varies even within families. Advances in molecular biology and neuroimaging, along with the development of mouse models, have helped elucidate the etiology of NF1 and its clinical manifestations. Furthermore, these advances have raised the prospect of therapeutic intervention for this complex and distressing disease.

Members of the United Kingdom Neurofibromatosis Association Clinical Advisory Board collaborated to produce a consensus statement on the guidelines for diagnosis and management of NF1. The proposals are based on published clinical studies and the pooled knowledge of experts in neurofibromatosis with experience in providing multidisciplinary clinical and molecular services for NF1 patients. The consensus statement discusses the diagnostic criteria, major differential diagnoses, clinical manifestations, and present strategies for monitoring and managing NF1 complications.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^116znBr6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

NF1 associated malignancies: malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, high-grade glioma, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, and breast cancer.

The typical malignant manifestations associated with NF1 include malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), high-grade gliomas (HGGs), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), and breast cancer. Patients with NF1 have an 8–16% lifetime risk of developing MPNSTs at any age; however, it is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20–40 years. Some individuals with NF1 have an elevated risk for MPNST development. Clinical assessment should include screening for the following clinical features suggestive of an MPNST: rapid tumour growth, new and persistent substantial pain, new motor deficit/weakness, sensory deficit, sphincter disturbance, swallowing or breathing difficulty, or any changes in tumour consistency.

MPNSTs can metastasize widely and are associated with lower overall survival in NF1 compared to MPNSTs in the general population. Most MPNSTs develop from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas and are difficult to differentiate from atypical neurofibromas (ANNUBPs). The combination of regional MRI and 18 FDG PET helps identify lesions with a high suspicion for malignancy. In some cases, a guided biopsy will be needed prior to excision for a diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment for MPNSTs is complete excision with broad margins; however, chemotherapy and radiotherapy might be considered in specific situations.

HGGs are mainly observed in adults and arise most frequently in the cerebral hemispheres.

### Current status of sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [^112QM41Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive soft tissue sarcomas that rarely occur in the general population but have a lifetime incidence of 8% to 13% in those with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Complete surgical resection is the standard treatment for MPNSTs. Unresectable MPNSTs carry a poor prognosis, and survival appears to be worse in NF1-associated tumors than in sporadic tumors.

The response rate of MPNSTs to standard chemotherapeutic agents used to treat pediatric and adult soft tissue sarcomas is unknown and is currently undergoing evaluation in a multi-institutional clinical trial. With an increasing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, clinical trials with targeted agents have become available and have established that histology-specific trials in this rare malignancy are feasible. This knowledge, coupled with the availability of preclinical MPNST models, likely will accelerate the development of effective treatments for this malignancy.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 revisited [^1155d1UX]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition with a worldwide incidence of approximately 1 per 2,500 to 3,000 individuals. Caused by a germ-line inactivating mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, the disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the past several years, significant progress has been made in standardizing management of the major clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 1. Moreover, improved understanding of how the neurofibromatosis type 1 protein, neurofibromin, regulates cell growth has recently provided insight into the pathogenesis of the disease and has led to the development of new therapies. In this review, we describe the clinical manifestations, recent molecular and genetic findings, and the developing therapies for managing clinical problems associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

### Past, present, and future therapeutic strategies for NF-1-associated tumors [^1119HDPh]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting 1 in 3,000 individuals. It is caused by a germline mutation of the NF1 gene. The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP) that converts active GTP-bound Ras into inactive GDP-bound Ras. Thus, NF1 loss leads to constitutive Ras activation and many clinical manifestations of NF-1, such as café-au-lait macules, seizures, chronic pain, vascular issues, bone defects, central and peripheral nervous system tumors, breast cancer, and other malignancies. Notably, tumorigenesis typically requires a second somatic hit and consequent loss of function in the remaining wild-type NF1 allele.

Patients with NF-1 are at a significantly increased risk for plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), a benign peripheral nervous system tumor that can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and low-grade gliomas (LGGs), a benign central nervous system tumor that can transform into malignant high-grade gliomas (HGGs). In addition, atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential (ANNUBP) comprise an intermediate tumor entity that reflects the transition from plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs. ANNUBPs are associated with CDKN2AB loss, and their diagnosis and classification remain an area of active investigation.

Here, we summarize past, present, and future treatment approaches for NF1-associated tumors. Given neurofibromin's function as a Ras-GAP and resulting Ras pathway misactivation, therapies at the time of writing have primarily focused on inhibiting Ras signaling.

### Psychosocial features of neurofibromatosis type 1 in children and adolescents [^1112sdw7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurologic condition associated with a wide variety of developmental deficits that have an important impact on children and adolescents.

- **Objective**: This article aims to document the psychosocial features of NF1 and to report the interventions described to address the needs of pediatric patients with NF1.

- **Methods**: A literature review was conducted concerning the social life, mental health, and quality of life (QOL) of children and adolescents with NF1 as well as the psychosocial interventions addressed to this population.

- **Results**: Compared to unaffected children and adolescents of the general population, pediatric patients with NF1 have an increased risk of having social difficulties, mental health disorders, behavioral and emotional problems, as well as diminished QOL. Only three articles describe interventions within the NF1 population to address these difficulties.

- **Conclusion**: There is a need to develop and assess psychosocial interventions for patients with NF1.

### Quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2 and schwannomatosis: A systematic review of the literature [^1121z5sg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to review the literature on quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis, and to identify the specific aspects of quality of life that were studied and reported in this population. We also set out to report predictors of quality of life. Published research reports were included if they described quality of life in this population and met methodological quality according to a list of predefined criteria. Eight studies (7 in NF1, 1 in NF2, 0 in schwannomatosis), conducted between 2001 and 2013, met inclusion criteria.

The methodological quality of the eight studies was mostly high according to ratings by predefined criteria. Most studies reported that patients with NF experience decreased quality of life when compared to the general population. Visibility and disease severity were strong predictors of skin-specific quality of life in NF1 patients. However, the majority of findings regarding predictors of quality of life were weak or inconclusive.

Given the decreased quality of life in NF patients, it is important to examine more comprehensively the psychosocial factors in this population, especially in patients with NF2 and schwannomatosis. Mind-body interventions that address these domains may provide comprehensive and efficacious long-term treatment.

### Subsequent neoplasms following a primary tumor in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112TMREF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

The study addresses fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding the risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs) in children with pathogenic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) variants exposed to radiation and/or alkylator chemotherapy, which have limited the use of these agents.

The methodology involved determining the SN risk in 167 NF1-affected versus 1,541 non-NF1-affected 5-year childhood cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Additionally, 176 non-overlapping NF1-affected individuals with primary tumors from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were analyzed, considering exposure to radiation and/or chemotherapy. A proportional subdistribution hazards multivariable regression analysis was used to examine risk factors, adjusting for type and age at primary tumor diagnosis and therapeutic exposures.

In the results from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort, the 20-year cumulative incidence of SNs in NF1 childhood cancer survivors was 7.3%, compared with 2.9% in non-NF1 childhood cancer survivors (P = .003), indicating a 2.4-fold higher risk of SNs (95% CI, 1.3 to 4.3; p = 0.005) in NF1-affected individuals. In the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cohort, among NF1-affected individuals with a primary tumor, the risk of SNs was 2.8-fold higher in patients with irradiated NF1 (95% CI, 1.3 to 6.0; p = 0.009). In contrast, the risk of SNs was not significantly elevated after exposure to alkylating agents (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.0; p = 0.9).

The conclusion indicates that children with NF1 who develop a primary tumor are at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^115q44ax]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

NF1 affects the individual from birth, thereby predisposing the patient to multisystem tumour complications from a very young age. The lifetime risk of cancer in patients with NF1 is estimated to be 59.6%, compared to 30.8% in the general population. The median age of cancer diagnosis in patients with NF1 is 39 years. However, the standardized incidence ratio for cancer in children and women under 30 years with NF1 is especially high. The life expectancy of patients with NF1 is generally decreased by 8–15 years, mainly due to malignancies.

Given the potential for tumour development, long-term surveillance is of utmost importance both in children and adults and should be performed by clinicians who understand the condition and can provide lifelong care. New proposals for the care of individuals with NF1 have been developed, as there are several disease-specific issues that differ from the general approach in sporadic tumours but need to be integrated within routine care. It is important not to delay assessment for patients who are at risk of serious complications; monitoring, surveillance, and management of individuals with NF1 requires a multidisciplinary approach and specific guidance adapted to the specific risks and natural history of the disease.

Patients with NF1 do not have access to the same level of care in all countries, and treatment varies across different institutions. This guideline aims to improve the quality of care by presenting information to assist healthcare professionals in tumour surveillance and management of individuals with NF1.

### Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: Transformation in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 [^115eL1uK]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma with an unfavorable prognosis and limited therapeutic options. MPNSTs can be sporadic but are often associated with neurofibromatosis (NF) 1 and usually arise from preexisting neurofibromas. MPNSTs in patients with NF2 have been reported in only exceedingly rare cases, and the mechanisms underlying transformation into an MPNST have not been fully elucidated. Here, we describe the clinicopathological and genomic features of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST), with a primary diagnosis of a neurofibroma, as it transforms into a high-grade MPNST in the context of NF2.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: New developments in genetics and treatment [^113myTQa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common neurocutaneous syndrome, with a frequency of 1 in 2500 persons. Diagnosis is paramount in the pretumor stage to provide proper anticipatory guidance for a number of neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene result in truncated and nonfunctional production of neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor protein involved in downregulating the RAS signaling pathway.

New therapeutic and preventive options include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, interferons, and radiofrequency therapy. This review summarizes recent updates in genetics, mutation analysis assays, and treatment options targeting aberrant genetic pathways. We also propose modified diagnostic criteria and provide an algorithm for surveillance of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax as a clinical manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113wdqje]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is painful for patients and can be lethal in 4.6% of cases. It is therefore important that clinicians are attentive to the pulmonary manifestations of NF1, which are characterized by lung cysts and bullae. It is essential to identify patients with an increased risk of developing SSP, as preventive surgery seems to decrease the risk of new events.

Our case involved a male who met five of the diagnostic criteria for NF1, with pulmonary manifestations including several lung cysts and bullae, and at least four incidents of SSP. This should lead to consideration of NF1 as the etiology of pneumothorax incidents. The diagnosis of NF1 was confirmed by genetic testing showing a pathogenic variant of the NF1 gene. To address a genotype–phenotype correlation between disease-causing variants of the NF1 gene and pneumothorax, genetic testing and screening for pulmonary manifestations in patients with NF1 are recommended for future clinical studies. Clinicians need to be aware that pneumothorax can be a manifestation of NF1.

- **Learning points**: Spontaneous pneumothorax is a clinical presentation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) caused by lung cysts and bullae. NF1 should be considered in patients presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax. It is of great importance that clinicians are attentive to pulmonary manifestations in patients diagnosed with NF1. Early diagnosis of pulmonary manifestations in patients with NF1 is crucial, as surgical removal of lung cysts and bullae seems to prevent spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Quality of life among children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1: A systematic review of the literature [^1131qsqc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this research is to identify, within a systematic review, aspects of quality of life (QoL) that are adversely affected in children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis (NF), and to report predictors of quality of life in this population. Published reports of original research were included if they described QoL in children and/or adolescents with NF, and met methodological quality according to a list of predefined criteria.

Seven studies conducted between 2006 and 2013 met inclusion criteria. All seven studies examined patients with NF1 and reported that these patients have lower general QoL compared to population norms. Parents' proxy ratings of QoL were generally lower than children's self-report ratings. By parent proxy, familial NF1 was a strong protective factor for QoL, while the opposite was found by child report. By parent proxy, male sex was significantly associated with lower scores on the parental time impact of QoL.

Skin-related QoL was only slightly altered in this population; vision-specific QoL was impacted only in patients with vision loss. The majority of findings regarding predictors of QoL in children with NF1 were weak, due to a lack of studies, heterogeneity of samples, and heterogeneity of measurements/predictors assessed. Future studies should examine more comprehensively the psychosocial factors affecting the NF population, especially in young patients with NF2 and schwannomatosis, who have been neglected in prior research. The use of consistent QoL measures is preferred to allow better comparison among studies and conditions.

### Breast cancer in neurofibromatosis 1: survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer in a five country cohort study [^114vKymi]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Five- and ten-year all-cause survival rates, adjusted for those diagnosed with NF1 after breast cancer diagnosis (delayed entry), were 64.9% (95% CI 54.8–76.8) and 49.8% (95% CI 39.3–63.0), respectively, among unscreened patients with NF1. Using breast cancer-specific survival, the ten-year survival rate was 64.2% (95% CI 53.5–77.0%), whereas for the screened non-NF1 familial population, it was 91.2% (95% CI 87.3–95.2%). Kaplan–Meier analysis is shown in Fig. 2, with both the unadjusted and delayed entry curves provided.

Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the more highly ascertained Manchester and Finnish populations had poorer all-cause and breast cancer–specific survival. The screened cases from Padova had a significantly better prognosis than the other four NF1 cohorts combined, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.18 (95% CI 0.04–0.72; P = 0.016). Most importantly, there were no breast cancer deaths in the Padova NF1 population.

### Family history does not influence stress or major coping styles in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1164PZsm]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that affects approximately 1 in 3000 individuals. NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition from an affected parent. Approximately 50% of cases are inherited, and 50% are de novo. NF1 is thought to be fully penetrant and displays wide inter- and intra-family phenotypic variability. Common signs include, but are not limited to, café-au-lait macules, inguinal freckling, optic glioma, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, long bone dysplasia, learning differences, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and increased cancer risk. Due to the varied signs and severity, NF1 is associated with significant uncertainty. This can impact an individual's surveillance, family planning, and mental health. Existing research has demonstrated that individuals with NF1 experience higher levels of stress compared to the general population and other cohorts as assessed by the PSS.

### Associations of clinical features in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) [^113UDo94]. Genetic Epidemiology (2000). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disease, exhibits extreme clinical variability. This variability greatly increases the burden for affected families and impairs our ability to understand the pathogenesis of NF1. Recognition of heterogeneity within a disease may provide important pathogenic insights; therefore, we tested clinical data from three large sets of NF1 patients for evidence that certain common features are more likely to occur in some NF1 patients than in others.

Clinical information on 4,402 patients with NF1 was obtained from three independent databases. We examined associations between pairs of clinical features in individual affected probands and between the occurrence of individual features in affected relatives. Associations were summarized as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We found associations between several pairs of features in affected probands:

- **Intertriginous freckling and Lisch nodules**
- **Discrete neurofibromas and plexiform neurofibromas**
- **Discrete neurofibromas and Lisch nodules**
- **Plexiform neurofibromas and scoliosis**
- **Learning disability or mental retardation and seizures**

We also found associations between the occurrence of the following individual features in parents and children with NF1:

- **Lisch nodules**
- **Macrocephaly**
- **Short stature**
- **Learning disability or mental retardation**

Our observations suggest that, contrary to established belief, some NF1 patients are more likely than others to develop particular manifestations of the disease. Genetic factors appear to determine the development of particular phenotypes.

### Neoplasms in neurofibromatosis 1 are related to gender but not to family history of cancer [^115kfu2Q]. Genetic Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

The risk of malignancies among persons with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is higher than in the general population, but the excess risk has not been precisely estimated. The effects of gender and inheritance pattern on cancer risk are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a historical cohort study to determine cancer risk factors by contacting 138 Caucasian NF1 patients originally seen at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston between 1978 and 1984. A total of 304 patients of all ethnic groups were evaluated at BCM during this period. We successfully located 173 patients, 138 of whom were Caucasian. We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with the age-, gender-, and time period-specific rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry for 2,094 person-years of observation (median follow-up = 16 years). Eleven incident tumors were reported.

- **Gender-related risk**: Females were at a much higher risk of cancer than males (SIR = 5.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7–10.3 and SIR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.0–3.0, respectively).

- **Family history**: We found no elevated cancer risk in unaffected first-degree relatives, regardless of whether the proband had cancer or not (SIR = 1.1, 95% CI, 0.6–1.8 and SIR = 1.0, 95% CI, 0.6–1.5, respectively).

Our results suggest that malignancy in the proband is not the result of a modifying gene that has a significant impact on general cancer risk.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic condition in which affected individuals develop benign and malignant nervous system tumours. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of these NF1-associated nervous system tumours recapitulate several of the unique clinical aspects of the disease. Moreover, these NF1 GEM models allow for a direct examination of the earliest stages of tumour evolution, including the contributions that NF1(±) cellular elements and cooperating genetic changes make to facilitate the transition from the pre-neoplastic to the neoplastic state and, in some cases, to promote malignant progression.

### Determination of end points for treatment of neurofibromatosis 1 [^116PmiN8]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is a progressive disorder affecting multiple systems of the body. Management currently focuses on anticipatory guidance, genetic counseling, and symptomatic treatment of specific lesions, usually through surgery. Insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder are beginning to suggest possible mechanisms of treatment, and clinical trials have begun for some types of lesions. The unpredictable natural history and variable phenotype present challenges for clinical trials in neurofibromatosis 1, which need to be addressed to develop a system for reliable testing of potential therapies.

### Can the diagnosis of nf1 be excluded clinically? A lack of pigmentary findings in families with spinal neurofibromatosis demonstrates a limitation of clinical diagnosis [^112PfN2f]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

For all living affected individuals in this family, a diagnosis of NF1 could be made by applying the clinical consensus criteria. However, this was only possible for many of them well into adulthood, due to both the paucity of pigmentary manifestations and the late onset of visible or symptomatic tumors in most individuals. What was not clinically straightforward was excluding NF1 in at-risk individuals. This posed a major source of anxiety for several family members, who were concerned about risks to their offspring of this disabling condition.

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis was considered by IV:5 and his wife due to the burdensome nature of his own and his mother's (III:5) condition, but it was not available when they were starting a family. After extensive consideration within the family, his two daughters were each tested at birth for the recently identified familial mutation, c.6364+2T > G, which was found to result in exclusion of exon 33 and a subsequent frameshift resulting in a prematurely terminated protein. They were found to be unaffected.

### Diagnostic difficulties and possibilities of NF1-like syndromes in childhood [^112Xz5jW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is caused by heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variations in the NF1 gene. NF1 is the most frequent neurocutaneous genetic disorder, with a prevalence of 1–5 per 10,000, characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance, but very heterogeneous and age-related expressivity. Its most distinctive features affect the skin, skeletal, and nervous system.

NF1 is associated with an increased risk for benign and malignant tumors and can be identified by genetic testing or clinical diagnostic criteria. These criteria were assembled by the NIH consensus development conference in 1987 and are still in use. The recommendation states that the diagnosis of NF1 should be established if the patient fulfills at least two criteria, or suspected if an individual meets only one of them:

- **Café-au-lait macules (CALMs)**: Six or more with > 5 mm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and > 15 mm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals.
- **Neurofibromas**: Two or more of any type, or one plexiform neurofibroma.
- **Freckling**: In the axillary or inguinal regions.
- **Optic pathway glioma (OPG)**: Presence of OPG.
- **Lisch nodules**: Two or more iris hamartomas.
- **Osseous lesions**: A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or tibial pseudarthrosis.
- **Family history**: A first-degree relative (parent, sibling, offspring) with NF1 as defined by the above criteria.

### In-hospital clinical features, morbidity, and mortality of patients with neurofibromatosis 1 in France: A nationwide, population-based retrospective cohort study [^114XrFfY]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disease that can affect nearly every organ system. The aim of our study was to describe the in-hospital population with NF1 in France. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French hospital administrative database. A total of 11,425 patients with NF1 (53.4% female, 19,080 person-years) were identified from January 2013 to December 2019.

A total of 23% had at least one diagnosis of a comorbidity or NF1-associated complication or disease, with the highest incidence in the age group of 10–15 years. A total of 2,601 (22.8%) had a diagnosis of cancer. There were 366 (3.2%) in-hospital deaths, and we observed a standardized mortality ratio of 4.14 (95% confidence interval = 3.71–4.56), with a higher standardized mortality ratio in women and in the age group of 10–15 years.

The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of cancer was 10.3 (95% confidence interval = 9.6–11.1). High SIR values for cancer were observed in childhood, with a decrease toward that of the general population by age 70 years. We observed high SIRs for NF1-associated cancers: CNS SIR of 195.4 (95% confidence interval = 172.2–220.9) and small intestine SIR of 102.9 (95% confidence interval = 71.7–143.2). The study provides a better understanding of the prognosis in people living with NF1.

### Neurofibromatosis 1: Clinical review and exceptions to the rules [^114HvwTE]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder with myriad clinical manifestations. Between 1991 and 1998, a total of 495 adults and children were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 at a specialized neurogenetics clinic in Sydney, Australia. This review establishes the prevalence of the clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 in these patients and provides guidelines for assessment and management. In addition, it reviews in detail patients who had unusual presentations and who represent important "exceptions to the rules" of clinical practice.

### Nf1 heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation [^112apsnh]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Since NF1 patients have a 10% lifetime chance of ultimately being diagnosed with MPNST, and the incidence of MPNST is very low in the general population, this leads to the general idea that NF1 patients, harboring an NF1 +/− microenvironment, are more susceptible to this cancer development. In support of this theory, NF1 patients have a worse prognosis compared to sporadic MPNST cases. However, due to its deeper anatomical location, NF1-associated MPNST is typically diagnosed at a later stage compared to non-NF1 patients. This could explain the poorer prognosis of NF1 patients with MPNST, and not necessarily because of the NF1 status of the microenvironment.

The consistent experimental and clinical evidence present in this study predicts that the number of MPNST cases in NF1 patients is actually much lower due to the antagonistic role of the NF1 +/− microenvironment, considering the size and number of pNF in NF1 patients. Indeed, one of the major confounding factors in the interpretation of death certificates and cohort studies resides in the lack of data describing precursor lesions of MPNST. It is conceivable that a population with an increased chance of developing benign lesions (i.e. NF1 patients with pNF) is more prone to develop MPNST than the general population (i.e. non-NF1 patients without pNF). To delineate the contribution of NF1 heterozygosity to malignancy, one would have to evaluate the percentage of non-NF1 patients with pNF that ultimately develop MPNST. Unfortunately, most, if not all, MPNSTs (whether from NF1 or non-NF1 patients) are rare.

### Neurofibromatosis 1-associated neuropathies: A reappraisal [^115N28Vd]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common disease that causes various multisystemic manifestations related either to the accumulation of neurofibromas or specific developmental abnormalities. The neurofibroma is the hallmark lesion of NF1 and develops from peripheral nerves. However, at the time of writing, the description of peripheral neuropathies associated with NF1 had not been investigated. To examine this question, we evaluated 688 NF1 patients for the presentation, prognosis, and associated morbidity of peripheral neuropathies in two hospital-based series. We collected data from 18 patients (four women and 14 men) with diffuse peripheral neuropathy (2.3%).

Eight patients had a paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic neuropathy detected only on electrophysiological study, two had minor sensory manifestations, five had moderate motor and sensory manifestations, and three had severe motor and sensory manifestations. Superimposed radicular changes were observed in seven cases. Two patients had a subacute and 16 had a chronic polyneuropathy. Fourteen patients had a demyelinating neuropathy with either severe axonal changes (three), moderate or minor axonal changes (four), or no axonal changes (seven). Four patients had axonal neuropathies.

There was a strong association between the presence of a peripheral neuropathy and large root diffuse neurofibromas (P < 0.03) and subcutaneous neurofibromas (P < 0.0001). Severe morbidity and mortality of patients with NF1 and peripheral neuropathies were 50%, much higher than what is observed in the general population of patients with NF1.

### Association between benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 [^111TVNLk]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

People with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a 10% lifetime risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNSTs are often metastatic and are a frequent cause of death among people with NF1. Clinical evidence suggests that most MPNSTs in people with NF1 develop from preexisting plexiform neurofibromas. However, it is not known whether an individual's risk of developing an MPNST is associated with the burden of benign neurofibromas. A study was conducted to determine whether people with NF1 who have benign neurofibromas of various kinds are at greater risk of developing MPNSTs than patients with NF1 who lack these benign tumors.

Clinical information on 476 NF1 probands in the Henri Mondor Database was analyzed by logistic regression to examine associations between MPNSTs and internal plexiform, superficial plexiform, subcutaneous, and cutaneous neurofibromas.

- **Results**: Individuals with subcutaneous neurofibromas were approximately three times more likely to have internal plexiform neurofibromas or MPNSTs than individuals without subcutaneous neurofibromas. Those with internal plexiform neurofibromas were 20 times more likely to have MPNSTs than individuals without internal plexiform neurofibromas. When this analysis was done with both subcutaneous and internal plexiform neurofibromas as explanatory variables, only the association of MPNSTs with internal plexiform neurofibromas remained significant.

The observation that malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are strongly associated with internal plexiform neurofibromas suggests a significant risk pattern among individuals with NF1.

### Moyamoya syndrome associated with neurofibromatosis type 1: Perioperative and long-term outcome after surgical revascularization [^1158D9tg]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can present with progressive arteriopathy of the branches of the internal carotid artery consistent with moyamoya syndrome. Clinical symptoms, radiographic evidence of ischemia, and the potential for disease progression may necessitate surgical revascularization to minimize the risk of stroke and progressive neurological deficits. This study aims to evaluate the presentation and surgical outcomes of these patients by reviewing clinical, radiographic, and angiographic data.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of clinical and radiographic records of all children with NF1 who were diagnosed with moyamoya syndrome and underwent surgical revascularization between January 1988 and April 2012 at Boston Children's Hospital.

- **Results**: During this period, 39 patients (27 female and 12 male, ages 0.2–19.3 years) had both NF1 and moyamoya syndrome, of whom 32 underwent surgical revascularization with pial synangiosis. Of the 32 patients treated by surgical revascularization, 21 (66%) manifested ischemic symptoms and 18 (56%) had radiographic evidence of prior stroke at the time of moyamoya diagnosis. In total, 25 of 32 patients developed neurological symptoms prior to surgical intervention. Only 1 patient presented with hemorrhage. The average age at first surgery was 8.1 years (range 0.5–15.6 years).

Perioperative complications in the first 7 days included stroke (n = 2), transient ischemic attack (n = 1), and infection (n = 1). Twenty-two patients had more than 6 months of follow-up, with an average clinical and radiographic follow-up period.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 and tumorigenesis: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^112wB5j8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2010). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by complex and multicellular neurofibroma tumors, and less frequently by malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and optic nerve gliomas. Significant advances have been made in elucidating the cellular, genetic, and molecular biology involved in tumor formation in NF1.

NF1 is caused by germline mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which generally result in decreased intracellular neurofibromin protein levels, leading to increased cascade Ras signaling to its downstream effectors. Multiple key pathways are involved in the development of tumors in NF1, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways.

Interestingly, recent studies demonstrate that multiple other developmental syndromes, in addition to NF1, share phenotypic features resulting from germline mutations in genes responsible for components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. In general, a somatic loss of the second NF1 allele, also referred to as loss of heterozygosity, in the progenitor cell (either the Schwann cell or its precursor), combined with haploinsufficiency in multiple supporting cells, is required for tumor formation.

Importantly, a complex series of interactions with these other cell types in neurofibroma tumorigenesis is mediated by abnormal expression of growth factors and their receptors and modification of gene expression. A key example of this is the process of recruitment and involvement of the NF1(±) heterozygous mast cell.

### Young stroke due to vascular anomaly from neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1137Khki]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The aetiology of stroke in young individuals often differs from that of older persons. In nearly half of these cases, no cause is established. Every effort should be made to determine a cause, as treatment varies accordingly, and the prognosis with rehabilitation is favorable when compared with older people. We present a case of pontine infarct in a 43-year-old man due to vascular ectasia associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Following the stroke, the patient underwent intensive rehabilitation and achieved a good functional outcome.

### Increased risk for dementia in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^117786JM]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 16 individuals with NF1 and 165 controls with dementia, Alzheimer disease, or antidementia medication, 10 and 65 died during the follow-up, respectively. Among individuals with NF1, 5 of the 10 deaths were due to dementia or Alzheimer disease, and these conditions were mentioned in 7 out of 10 death certificates. The corresponding numbers were 21 out of 65 (32%) and 37 out of 65 (57%) among controls. The survival specific to dementia-related causes of death was 75% among individuals with NF1 and 89% among controls five years after the first observed dementia-related diagnosis or drug purchase. The relative rate of death caused by dementia was 2.42 (95% CI 0.90–6.47) in NF1 compared to controls with dementia or Alzheimer disease.

### Preimplantation genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1: More than 20 years of clinical experience [^113RcGbG]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Clinical follow-up after preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) showed that 18 out of 67 couples (26.9%) did not achieve an ongoing pregnancy. Eight couples chose to end their PGT treatment prematurely, without completing three cycles. Their reasons included maternal health concerns (1 case, where the male partner was affected but unrelated to NF1), a partner's death related to NF1 (1 case, affecting the male), the emotional impact of the PGT treatment (2 cases), and perceiving a low chance of success due to a lack of unaffected embryos for transfer in a previous cycle (1 case; this couple opted for IVF without PGT). Additionally, one couple experienced a spontaneous pregnancy between cycles, leading them to discontinue treatment. For two couples, the reasons for discontinuation were unknown. Ten couples proceeded with at least three PGT cycles but were unable to achieve an ongoing pregnancy.

### Serum biomarkers for neurofibromatosis type 1 and early detection of malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors [^1116pVHa]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome with an estimated incidence at birth of 1 in 2500 and complete penetrance. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which codes for the tumor-suppressor protein neurofibromin. Neurofibromin acts as a Ras-negative regulator via its Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. Monoallelic and biallelic loss of NF1 leads to increased Ras activity in affected cells.

Among the defining features of NF1 is the development of benign peripheral nerve-sheath tumors, which can arise at virtually any site in the body. While cutaneous neurofibromas (CNF) are mostly visible and palpable, subcutaneous neurofibromas, internal plexiform neurofibromas (PNF), and malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors (MPNST) are difficult to detect, quantify, or monitor.

MPNST are the major cause of the reduced lifespan of patients with NF1. They can lead to death if not detected early and treated in time. The primary forms of treatment are selective resection of benign PNF and radical surgical resection of MPNST. However, the invasive growth pattern of MPNST often prohibits complete tumor removal, especially when diagnosed late in their development. Moreover, although chemotherapy and radiotherapy may delay recurrence, they have little effect on long-term survival.

The lifetime risk of developing MPNST for patients with NF1 has been estimated to be about 8 to 13%, which is more than 1000 times higher than for the general population. Moreover, many patients with NF1 develop MPNST at an unusually high rate.

### The impact of cutaneous neurofibromas on quality of life and mental health in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^114hqksa]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 OMIM:162200) is a progressive, autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder. NF1 is associated with a significant disease burden and reduced quality of life (QoL). Prognosticating skin disease severity is challenging outside of two variants: NF1:p. Met992del and a missense change at NF1:p. Arg1809, which lack cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF), and the recurrent 1.4 Mb NF1 microdeletion (Type 1), which is associated with a more severe cNF burden.

Despite the potential for serious systemic complications such as malignancy, the principal concern for younger adults with NF1 is the burden of cutaneous manifestations. NF1 patients frequently present for medical care seeking treatment of their cNFs. Previous studies have found higher rates of depression — up to 55% — in NF1 individuals compared to the general population, and 15% of NF1 patients had clinically significant anxiety. NF1 disease visibility has been associated with psychiatric morbidity, although this has not been studied in the context of patients seeking treatment for their cNFs.

### Whole-body positron emission tomography with F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging as a screening tool for the detection of malignant transformation in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1123xVn2]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. They can result from premalignant neurofibromas, including neurofibromas with atypia and atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biological potential. Some phenotypic characteristics have been described as associated with their development. The aim of this study was to outline our use of whole-body positron emission tomography with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1, especially in the screening of asymptomatic individuals with a higher risk of developing an MPNST, and to study its impact on neurofibroma classification (malignant vs. premalignant) and MPNST staging over time.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 who underwent a positron emission tomography with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging between 2017 and 2021 were included, analyzing separately the screened population. Maximum standard uptake value and diffusion-weighted imaging were assessed. Biopsy or surgery confirmed the diagnosis. In all, 345 positron emission tomography with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging procedures were performed in 241 patients, including 149 asymptomatic (62%) but at-risk patients.

- **Findings**: Eight MPNSTs in eight screened individuals (5%), six neurofibromas with atypia in four individuals (3%), and 29 atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biological potential in 23 individuals (15%) were diagnosed.

Over time, the proportion of grade 3 MPNST and the malignant/premalignant ratio in screened individuals increased.

### Age at symptom onset and long-term survival in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 [^113CRGew]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an intractable disorder predisposing patients to multiple tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). To clarify the survival rate and characteristics that predict poor survival, we retrospectively reviewed clinical data from cases of NF2.

From among 283 patients with neurofibromatosis who had been registered in a nationwide study in Japan between 1986 and 1987, 74 patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas were analyzed. The mean duration of follow-up after diagnosis was 121 months (range 2–287 months). Results of a Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis indicated that overall 5-, 10-, and 20-year patient survival rates following diagnosis of NF2 were 85%, 67%, and 38%, respectively. Early onset of the initial symptom significantly compromised survival; 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival rates in patients with symptom onset at an age younger than 25 years were 80%, 60%, and 28%, respectively, whereas in patients with symptom onset at an age of 25 years or older, the rates were 100%, 87%, and 62%, respectively. Patients with small vestibular schwannomas at diagnosis (< 2 cm in diameter) had better rates of survival. Other variables such as sex, additional tumors in the CNS, or dermal abnormalities did not significantly affect survival.

This first report of long-term follow-up results concerning the survival of patients with NF2 indicates an adverse effect of early symptom onset.

### NF1 heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation [^114opVkA]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal genetic disorder. Patients with NF1 are associated with mono-allelic loss of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 in their germline, which predisposes them to develop a wide array of benign lesions. Intriguingly, recent sequencing efforts revealed that the NF1 gene is frequently mutated in multiple malignant tumors not typically associated with NF1 patients, suggesting that NF1 heterozygosity is refractory to at least some cancer types. In two orthogonal mouse models representing NF1- and non-NF1-related tumors, we discover that an Nf1 +/− microenvironment accelerates the formation of benign tumors but impairs further progression to malignancy. Analysis of benign and malignant tumors commonly associated with NF1 patients, as well as those with high NF1 gene mutation frequency, reveals an antagonistic role for NF1 heterozygosity in tumor initiation and malignant transformation and helps to reconcile the role of the NF1 gene in both NF1 and non-NF1 patient contexts.

### Cutaneous neurofibromas and quality of life in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1129fhk5]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

There is a burgeoning interest in therapeutic development for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), a major cause of morbidity in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To determine meaningful clinical trial outcomes, a deeper understanding is needed regarding how cNFs are associated with quality of life (QoL). However, this understanding has been hampered by challenges in recruiting participants with this rare genetic disease.

The objective of the study was to develop a large, crowdsourced validated registry of persons with NF1 and determine the association of specific cNF features with QoL, pain, and itch.

From May 2021 to December 2023, a decentralized platform was developed, recruiting persons 40 years or older with NF1 and at least 1 cNF from 49 states and 12 countries. Participants provided clinical survey data, detailed photographs, and genetic sequencing data. Photographs from 583 participants were scored on 12 features of cNFs, including general severity, number, size, facial severity, color, and subtypes.

- **Exposure**: cNF features derived from participant-supplied photographs.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Total Skindex scores and subdomain scores (symptoms, emotion, function, pain, and itch).

Results indicated that of 583 participants, 384 (65.9%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 51.7 (40.0–83.0) years. Female sex, general severity, number, size, and facial severity of cNFs were negatively associated with QoL, as demonstrated by increased total Skindex scores. QoL had the largest association with the number of cNFs and the presence of facial cNFs.

### Family history does not influence stress or major coping styles in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^111ADwNX]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Future research could explore if family history impacts other aspects of patients' experiences with NF1, such as the time to diagnosis or health communication. Additionally, studies could examine how a family history of NF1 and parental discussions about NF1 may influence affected and unaffected children and adolescents. Other studies could further evaluate the role of perceived severity of NF1 and other qualitative factors on stress and coping through validated measures and clinical correlation.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation in NF1: Evidence for a more severe phenotype associated with missense mutations affecting NF1 codons 844–848 [^114N7RwA]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with NF1 are at a higher risk of developing specific malignancies compared to the general population, significantly increasing mortality. Besides the high-grade gliomas, the most common malignancies in NF1-affected children are rhabdomyosarcomas, JMML, and neuroblastomas, though accurate estimates of prevalence are not available due to the rarity of these tumors. Based on data provided by Sung et al. and Crucis et al, the prevalence of rhabdomyosarcomas in children with NF1 is estimated at 0.4%–0.5%, while Chang and Shannon reported that the individual risk of JMML in NF1 is approximately 0.04%. In the studied group, three NF1-affected children younger than 5 years developed embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. This includes one individual, now over 26 years old, who survived both a rhabdomyosarcoma and an astrocytoma grade II, diagnosed at ages 2 and 15 years, respectively. Furthermore, one 5-year-old girl (out of 50 children ≤ 8 years) presented with a (p. Gly848Arg) as well as c.1246C > T (p. Arg416*), with p. Gly848Arg being the first hit given the absence of p. Arg416* in buccal swabs, indicating somatic mosaicism for p. Arg416*.

A UK population-based hospital admission and death certificate study found that individuals with NF1 have, after excluding the well-established risks of nervous system tumors, a 2.7-fold increased risk of developing cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, lung, bone, thyroid, malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, breast, and ovary.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 families with first-degree relatives harbouring distinct pathogenic variants. Genetic counselling and familial diagnosis: what should be offered [^117XBtic]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in NF1. Recently, NF1 testing has been included as a clinical criterion for NF1 diagnosis. Additionally, preconception genetic counselling in patients with NF1 focuses on a 50% risk of transmitting the familial variant, as the risk of having a sporadic NF1 is considered the same as the general population.

- **Methods**: 829 individuals, comprising 583 NF1 sporadic cases and 246 patients with NF1 with documented family history, underwent genetic testing for NF1. Genotyping and segregation analysis of NF1 familial variants were determined by microsatellite analysis and NF1 sequencing.

- **Results**: The mutational analysis of NF1 in 154 families with two or more affected cases studied showed the co-occurrence of two different NF1 germline pathogenic variants in four families. The estimated mutation rate in those families was 3.89×10^-3, 20 times higher than the NF1 mutation rate (~2×10^-4) (p = 0.0008). Furthermore, the co-occurrence of two different NF1 germline pathogenic variants in these families was 1:39, 60 times the frequency of sporadic NF1 (1:2500) (p = 0.003). In all cases, the de novo NF1 pathogenic variant was present in a descendant of an affected male. In two cases, variants were detected in the inherited paternal wild-type allele.

- **Conclusions**: Our results, together with previously reported cases, suggest that the offspring of male patients with NF1 may have an increased risk of experiencing de novo NF1 pathogenic variants. This observation, if confirmed in additional cohorts, could have relevant implications.

### Breast cancer in neurofibromatosis 1: Survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer in a five country cohort study [^111PDNpf]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Tumor pathology for the cases included in the delayed entry analysis is presented in Table 3. The NF1 population had lower rates of in situ disease than the screened non-NF1 group, as might be expected without mammographic screening. The invasive cancers were much less likely to be stage 1 in the NF1 cohorts without screening compared to the non-NF1 group (20.5% vs. 59.3%; P < 0.0001). There was also a higher rate of HER2+ cancers at 24.1% among patients with NF1 versus 11.1% among patients without NF1 (P = 0.03).

Otherwise, tumors in the NF1 and non-NF1 groups were well matched for age at diagnosis, grade, and ER status. However, among the NF1 cohorts, the more highly ascertained Manchester and Finnish populations had poorer prognosis cancers with higher proportions of HER2+, ER−, and higher stage cancers. Patients with NF1 and ER+ breast cancer had better survival following a median follow-up of 6.1 years since breast cancer (range 0.28 to 18.7) [ER+ vs. ER−, HR 2.8 (95% CI 1.2–6.8), P = 0.022]. Unscreened grade 3 cancers in women carrying NF1 gene defects had the worst 10-year survival at 44.2% (95% CI 29.3–66.9%).

### Preimplantation genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1: more than 20 years of clinical experience [^115XQBxA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Our study has limitations due to its retrospective design and population size. However, the population size is similar to other studies reporting on PGT for a specific indication. Given the two decades this study has covered, the feasibility of a larger prospective study seems very limited. There are several strengths to this study. We included all referred couples with the indication of NF1 at our PGT expert center and performed an in-depth assessment of the patient files, resulting in a complete and detailed overview. We provide valuable, disease-specific information that could aid future reproductive counseling of NF1 patients worldwide.

PGT is a successful reproductive option for preventing the birth of NF1-affected offspring. Although acknowledging the limitations of our study, we did not find a clinically or statistically significant difference in IVF complications in our cohort when comparing NF1-affected females to partners of affected males. Cardiac screening in women with NF1 prior to IVF treatment showed no previously unknown contraindications, raising the question of whether this diagnostic step is necessary. Timely reproductive counseling is important. For several couples, PGT was not possible due to factors such as maternal age, diminished ovarian reserve, or the inability to identify an underlying genetic defect. We observed a non-significant increased rate of male infertility in men affected with NF1, knowledge that could aid couples in opting for adding PGT to an already indicated IVF treatment.

### Neoplasms associated with germline and somatic NF1 gene mutations [^116ECM1B]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is a tumor predisposition genetic syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance and virtually 100% penetrance by the age of 5 years. NF1 results from a loss-of-function mutation in the NF1 gene, resulting in decreased levels of neurofibromin in the cell. Neurofibromin is a negative regulator of various intracellular signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation. Although the loss of heterozygosity in the NF1 gene may predispose NF1 patients to certain malignancies, additional genetic alterations are a prerequisite for their development. The precise nature of these additional genetic alterations is not well defined, making genetic testing of all malignancies in NF1 patients an essential component of future research.

In addition to germline NF1 mutations, the alteration of the somatic NF1 gene is associated with sporadic malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of the colon, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive English and non-English language search for all articles pertinent to malignancies associated with NF1 was conducted using PubMed, a search engine provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Keywords searched included "malignancies associated with NF1", "tumors associated with NF1", and "NF1 and malignancies". A comprehensive analysis in terms of age and mode of presentation, investigation and therapeutic modalities, and outcome of the published data was performed and compared with similar studies.

### Molecular profiles of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas: Identification of a gene expression signature of poor prognosis [^117Lo7Yz]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a complex variety of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the development of heterogeneous benign neurofibromas, which may appear as dermal neurofibromas or plexiform neurofibromas. NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas are at risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

To obtain additional insight into the molecular pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays to quantify the mRNA expression of 349 selected genes in plexiform neurofibromas in comparison with dermal neurofibromas and patient-matched malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

- **Results**: Thirty genes were significantly up-regulated in plexiform neurofibromas compared with dermal neurofibromas. None were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes mainly encoded transcription factors and growth factors and secreted proteins, cytokines, and their receptors, pointing to a role of paracrine and autocrine signaling defects in the genesis of plexiform neurofibromas. We also identified a gene expression profile, based on MMP9, FLT4/VEGFR3, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2, SHH, and GLI1, which discriminated those plexiform neurofibromas most likely to undergo malignant transformation.

Our study has identified a limited number of signaling pathways that could be involved, when altered, in plexiform neurofibroma development. Some of the up-regulated genes could be useful diagnostic or prognostic markers or form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies.
