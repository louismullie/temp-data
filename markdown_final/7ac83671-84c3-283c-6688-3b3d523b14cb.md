## Question

WBC with a left shift

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret a white blood cell (WBC) count with a left shift, including definitions, mechanisms, diagnostic implications, pitfalls, and a practical decision framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and how a left shift is measured. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why it happens. Next, I will examine diagnostic value across common clinical scenarios, followed by limitations and confounders. After that, I should integrate a practical decision framework and highlight special populations. Finally, I will synthesize key takeaways and ensure the reasoning aligns with the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it. A left shift refers to an increase in immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood, classically band neutrophils, and sometimes metamyelocytes, myelocytes, or even promyelocytes, which reflects premature release from the bone marrow in response to demand. It is typically quantified as an elevated immature-to-total neutrophil ratio or an increased band percentage, with many laboratories flagging bandemia when bands exceed about 10% of the differential, although thresholds vary by institution and context [^115iYdi6] [^114FhzKt] [^116i3FV8].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I jump ahead. The left shift arises when inflammatory signals such as G-CSF drive accelerated myelopoiesis and mobilization of storage pools, releasing bands and earlier precursors into circulation. This is a reactive process meant to meet increased host defense needs, and it can occur with infection, inflammation, tissue injury, or cytokine-driven stress responses, which explains its association with bacterial infections and inflammatory states [^116WTEvs] [^117WKeXs] [^115iYdi6].

> I will now examine diagnostic value in suspected infection, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because performance varies by setting. In general, the presence of a left shift increases the likelihood of bacterial infection, yet it is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule in or rule out infection on its own. In a systematic review of febrile children, WBC indices including left shift had limited diagnostic value for serious infection, with positive likelihood ratios around 0.87–2.43 and negative likelihood ratios near 0.61–1.14, underscoring that inflammatory markers like CRP and procalcitonin outperform WBC features for ruling in or ruling out serious infection [^11186QHs]. In adults with suspected sepsis, bandemia correlates with severity but again lacks standalone diagnostic specificity, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical context and organ dysfunction assessment rather than relying on bands alone [^115iYdi6] [^113eyLA8].

> Next, I should review appendicitis, where left shift has been studied more granularly. In children with suspected appendicitis, the combination of elevated WBC and left shift yields a positive likelihood ratio around 9.8, while either elevated WBC or left shift has an LR+ near 3.9, and the absence of both carries a negative likelihood ratio around 0.26, which meaningfully shifts pretest probability. Importantly, a normal WBC without left shift substantially lowers the likelihood of appendicitis, though it does not absolutely exclude it, so I need to ensure I interpret these results alongside clinical findings and imaging when appropriate [^116JL1HK] [^114Ebb74] [^1178KiNC]. Hold on, I should verify that these figures come from the same dataset; yes, the ACEP policy cites Wang et al. with consistent LR estimates, which supports the strength of evidence here [^116JL1HK] [^114Ebb74].

> Let me consider other infectious and inflammatory contexts to avoid overgeneralization. In HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia or a left shift is common, though baseline WBC may be altered in advanced HIV, so I should interpret changes relative to the patient's baseline and the clinical picture. Similarly, in tick-borne rickettsial diseases, a normal or mildly elevated WBC with increased immature neutrophils can occur, but labs are often nonspecific early, so treatment decisions should not be delayed by normal counts. And in COVID-19, a left shift with toxic changes can reflect severe inflammatory dysregulation rather than bacterial coinfection, so I need to be cautious not to overcall secondary infection solely based on bandemia [^111upusP] [^114HxcdX] [^116znzzg] [^1157J73Q].

> But wait, what if the left shift is not due to infection at all. I should double-check for noninfectious causes and confounders. Corticosteroids can cause a dose-dependent leukocytosis with a left shift peaking around 48 hours, so an unexpected rise after low-dose steroids or a new spike after day 3–4 should prompt evaluation for alternative causes. G-CSF therapy directly increases circulating neutrophils and can produce a left shift during neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. Hematologic malignancies such as CML and other MPNs can show left-shifted leukocytosis, often with basophilia, requiring BCR-ABL testing to exclude CML. And benign ethnic neutropenia with a compensatory left shift, as well as Pelger-Huët anomaly mimicking bands, are important mimics that can mislead if I don't review the smear and history carefully [^1164RvGb] [^111314sy] [^116WTEvs] [^117WKeXs] [^113bPTkZ] [^11713KoD] [^112TEFVE].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and measurement nuances. In neonates, automated immature granulocyte percentages are noninferior to manual band counts for detecting infection, and age-specific reference intervals for the I:T ratio or IG% should be used to avoid misclassification. In pregnancy, physiologic leukocytosis with a left shift can occur in the third trimester and resolves postpartum, so I should interpret counts against gestational norms. And in older adults, WBC responses may be blunted, so a normal or mildly elevated WBC with a left shift may still be clinically significant in the right context [^116i3FV8] [^111Zev2E] [^114QKP5w].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework so I don't miss actionable steps. First, confirm the left shift with a manual differential if the automated report is unexpected or if blasts or atypical cells are suspected, because morphology matters. Second, integrate the left shift with the total WBC, ANC, clinical signs, and inflammatory markers such as CRP or procalcitonin to refine probability of bacterial infection. Third, consider pretest probability and disease-specific scoring systems; for example, in pediatric appendicitis, the combination of WBC and left shift meaningfully updates risk, whereas in undifferentiated febrile illness, CRP and procalcitonin add more diagnostic value than WBC indices alone. Finally, if the left shift is unexplained or discordant, broaden the differential to include steroids, cytokine therapy, hematologic malignancy, or congenital anomalies, and escalate testing accordingly [^114QKP5w] [^116JL1HK] [^11186QHs] [^113bPTkZ].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications because clinicians often ask about risk. Severe bandemia, particularly when combined with abnormal vital signs, has been associated with higher revisit and mortality rates in discharged ED patients, suggesting that the degree of left shift can stratify risk even if it is not etiologically specific. Likewise, in COVID-19 and other severe inflammatory states, the presence of a left shift with toxic changes correlates with disease severity, so documenting the magnitude and morphology can inform disposition and monitoring intensity [^114vnWax] [^116znzzg] [^112HHxRy].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. A left shift signals increased myeloid demand and is a marker of inflammatory stress rather than a stand-alone diagnostic test. It modestly increases the likelihood of bacterial infection and can be particularly informative when combined with leukocytosis in disease-specific contexts such as pediatric appendicitis, but it performs poorly for ruling out serious infection in undifferentiated febrile children. Noninfectious causes and analytic pitfalls are common, so I should confirm morphology, apply disease-specific likelihood ratios, and integrate with clinical and biomarker data before making decisions [^116JL1HK] [^11186QHs] [^114QKP5w].

A left shift on the WBC differential means an **increased proportion of immature neutrophils** (bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes) in the blood, indicating early marrow release in response to infection, inflammation, or stress [^114QKP5w]. It is most often due to bacterial infection, but can also occur with inflammation, tissue injury, or marrow stimulation (e.g. G-CSF, corticosteroids) [^114QKP5w] [^116WTEvs]. Clinically, a left shift supports an infectious or inflammatory process and should be interpreted with the total WBC, clinical context, and other labs (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin) [^11186QHs]. Persistent or unexplained left shift warrants evaluation for underlying causes, including hematologic disorders [^113bPTkZ].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

A left shift is defined by an **increase in immature neutrophils** — bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and occasionally promyelocytes — in the peripheral blood [^114QKP5w]. It reflects early marrow release of neutrophils in response to increased demand, most often due to infection or inflammation [^115iYdi6]. The degree of left shift correlates with disease severity and is a marker of systemic inflammatory response [^115iYdi6].

---

## Causes of left shift

Left shift can result from **multiple causes**, including:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Bacterial infections (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis, appendicitis) [^111HiasY] [^116JL1HK] <br/> - Severe viral infections (e.g. COVID-19) [^116znzzg] |
| Inflammatory | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Acute pancreatitis |
| Tissue injury | - Trauma <br/> - Surgery <br/> - Burns <br/> - Myocardial infarction [^115stWHd] |
| Hematologic | - Leukemia (e.g. CML, AML) [^113bPTkZ] <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndromes [^114EUrzm] <br/> - Paraneoplastic leukemoid reactions [^115LmmX1] |
| Medications | - Corticosteroids [^1164RvGb] <br/> - G-CSF [^116WTEvs] <br/> - Epinephrine |
| Physiological | - Pregnancy (especially third trimester) [^111Zev2E] <br/> - Stress/exercise [^114QKP5w] |

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic value

A left shift is a **nonspecific marker** of infection or inflammation and should be interpreted with the total WBC, clinical context, and other labs (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin) [^11186QHs]. It is especially useful in acute bacterial infections, where it supports the diagnosis and gauges severity [^115iYdi6]. In pediatrics, a left shift increases the likelihood of appendicitis and correlates with perforation risk [^116JL1HK] [^115CiN6W]. In adults, it aids sepsis recognition and severity assessment, though it is not specific for infection [^113eyLA8].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Left shift has important **limitations**:

- **Nonspecificity**: It can occur in noninfectious inflammation, tissue injury, or marrow stimulation [^114QKP5w].
- **Medications**: Corticosteroids and G-CSF can cause a left shift without infection [^1164RvGb] [^116WTEvs].
- **Hematologic disorders**: Leukemia and MDS can present with left shift, requiring careful differentiation [^113bPTkZ] [^114EUrzm].
- **Physiological states**: Pregnancy and stress can produce a left shift [^111Zev2E] [^114QKP5w].

---

## Clinical approach to left shift

When a left shift is identified, **clinicians should**:

- **Confirm**: Verify with a manual differential if automated results are unclear [^114QKP5w].
- **Contextualize**: Integrate with clinical findings, total WBC, and inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) [^11186QHs].
- **Evaluate**: Look for infection, inflammation, tissue injury, or medication effects [^114QKP5w].
- **Escalate**: If unexplained or persistent, assess for hematologic disorders (e.g. bone marrow biopsy, molecular testing) [^113bPTkZ].

---

## Prognostic significance

The degree of left shift correlates with **severity and outcomes** in infection and inflammation [^115iYdi6]. In COVID-19, a left shift with toxic changes signals severe disease and higher mortality [^116znzzg]. In sepsis, it reflects severity and risk of deterioration [^115iYdi6]. In pediatrics, it predicts appendicitis severity and complications [^115CiN6W].

---

A left shift reflects **early neutrophil release** and signals infection or inflammation; it is a useful, nonspecific marker that should be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other labs. Persistent or unexplained left shift needs further evaluation for underlying causes, including hematologic disease [^113bPTkZ].

### The use of white blood cell count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children [^1178KiNC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients is unproven. It is commonly thought that children with appendicitis have an elevated WBC count with a left shift; however, most data supporting this belief stem from studies conducted on appendicitis in adults, not children. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the value of WBC count and differential in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain.

Methods

Seven hundred twenty-two pediatric ED patients with a primary complaint of nontraumatic abdominal pain were identified by prospective and retrospective methods. White blood cell count with differential was performed on patients with history and physical examination findings that were felt to warrant laboratory investigation. Results of WBC counts were determined as low, normal, or high, with or without a left shift, based on normal age-related values per laboratory protocol for pediatric patients.

Results

The diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 10.2% of all patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain. Thirty percent of toddlers (1–3.9 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of toddlers with low WBC counts and 4.8% of toddlers with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 6.5, P = 0.04). A normal WBC count did not rule out appendicitis in toddlers; however, the negative predictive value (NPV) for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 95.6%). In the child age group (4–11.9 years), high WBC count was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children (sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 72%), and the NPV for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 89.5%). Lastly, 43.9% of adolescents (12–19 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of adolescents with low WBC counts and 8.3% of adolescents with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 37.3, P < 0.001). The NPV for a low or normal WBC count was also high in the adolescent group (NPV = 91.9%). Left shift was also strongly associated with appendicitis. Among toddlers, 40% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 1.8% of toddlers without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 25.7, P < 0.001, NPV = 98.2%). Similarly, left shift was strongly associated with appendicitis in children and adolescents. Among children, 54.3% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 5.4% of children without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 67.8, P < 0.001, NPV = 90.5%). Among adolescents, 53.5% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 6.1% of adolescents without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 72.3, P < 0.001, NPV = 93.9%). In patients with a left shift, 51.2% had appendicitis, whereas 3.7% of patients without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 226.2; P < 0.001, NPV = 96.3%). In all patients with appendicitis, elevated WBC counts had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 80%. Using left shift alone as an indicator for appendicitis was associated with a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 90%. However, when a high WBC count and left shift were combined, the sensitivity climbed to 80%, and specificity remained at 79%. The sensitivity fell to 47% when both a high WBC count and left shift were analyzed, and specificity climbed to 94%. The positive likelihood ratio for a high WBC count and left shift was 9.8.

Conclusions

The determination of WBC count and differential is useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the ED with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain, regardless of age. High WBC counts and left shift are independently, strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. In fact, for this subset of patients older than 4 years, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count was appendicitis. The presence of an increased WBC count or left shift carries with it a high sensitivity (79%), and the presence of both high WBC count and left shift has the highest specificity (94%). These values are, therefore, helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis. Although not absolute, the WBC count and left shift can be helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis.

### White blood cell left shift in a neonate: a case of mistaken identity [^112TEFVE]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

We present a full-term male infant who presented with tachypnea and an increased band count on his complete blood count (CBC) with an immature to total neutrophil (I:T) ratio of 0.6 raising suspicion of early onset sepsis. A blood culture was drawn and he was started on appropriate antibiotics. The patient's clinical condition rapidly improved; however, the white cell count 'left shift' persisted. When a detailed family history was obtained, it was discovered that the father, paternal uncle and the grandfather had been diagnosed with Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA). As the urine, blood and CSF cultures were all negative in this now well-appearing infant, the left shift on the CBC was believed to be due to inheritance of the PHA. We present this case to emphasize that even in this age of sophisticated laboratory evaluation, a good clinical history, including family history, and clinical evaluation, are essential for accurate diagnosis.

Appendicitis laboratory testing in children (Wang et al., 2007) — a retrospective diagnostic study evaluating white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift for acute appendicitis with the criterion standard "not stated under methods" — reported in 104 children a disease prevalence of 10.2%; high WBC count and left shift yielded sensitivity 59% and specificity 94% with LR+ 9.8 and LR- 0.44, and using either elevated WBC count or left shift showed sensitivity 79% with LR+ 3.9 and LR- 0.26; limitations included that the criterion standard was not stated and generalizability concerns.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bacterial CAP in HIV — presentation, examination, and hospitalization threshold — are generally similar to those in individuals without HIV, with acute symptom onset over 3–5 days typical for S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus infections. Indicators of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension, and tachypnea with decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicates moderate-to-severe pneumonia for which clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Bacterial pneumonia commonly shows focal consolidation signs on exam, whereas Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) often has a normal lung exam or inspiratory crackles if abnormal; white blood cell count is usually elevated (often relative to baseline in advanced HIV) with possible neutrophilia or left shift. On chest radiograph, bacterial pneumonia characteristically produces unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; consolidation is typical with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus, whereas cavitation may suggest P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^116JL1HK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric appendicitis — clinical and laboratory predictors are described, with combined variable scoring yielding a negative likelihood ratio of 0.058 (95% CI 0.008 to 0.41). In children presenting to the emergency department, for both an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and a left shift the positive likelihood ratio was 9.8, whereas for either an elevated WBC count or a left shift the negative likelihood ratio was 0.26; individually, an elevated WBC count (positive likelihood ratio 3.4; negative likelihood ratio 0.41) and a left shift (positive likelihood ratio 5.9; negative likelihood ratio 0.45) were not as strong. A Class III prospective study found that temperature greater than 38°C, a WBC count of 10,100/ mm³ or greater, and rebound tenderness were significantly associated with pediatric appendicitis, and a resulting prediction rule had a 1% missed appendicitis rate and a 9% negative appendectomy rate. Additional retrospective data identified guarding and temperature greater than 38.4°C as predictive in girls 5 to 12 years of age, and tenderness and vomiting as predictive in boys 5 to 12 years of age.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^115iYdi6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

It is of interest that one of the criteria for SIRS involves the appearance in the circulation of immature neutrophils, whose mature forms are essential for the elimination of foreign bacteria but whose untoward activities could lead to organ failure. The appearance of band cells in the blood of patients with bacterial infections is commonly referred to as 'a shift to the left'. Because SIRS is often initiated by infections, 90% of which are bacterial in origin, there is the question whether, in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, elevated levels of circulating band cells are associated predominantly with N-I SIRS or with sepsis. We therefore investigated the relative merits of the WBC criteria of Bone et al. and of Levy et al. in identifying patients with SIRS and whether monitoring levels of all forms of immature neutrophils could help in differentiating patients with N-I SIRS from those with sepsis. It was recently shown in patients with septic shock that increased mortality was related to WBC counts and that in patients with sepsis an increase in the number of immature neutrophils reflected disease severity and predicted patient deterioration. On this basis, we also examined whether levels of immature neutrophils had a bearing on patient outcome.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^114EUrzm]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^111T2Uwy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

When you get to seven, the probability of appendicitis raises dramatically so you may want to operate especially if the patient is a young male. If the patient is a woman, additional investigations may be required to rule out gynecological disorders. This particular situation was validated in a meta-analysis study of adult and pediatric patients which proved that an Alvarado score below four to five rules out the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children, and in adults, an Alvarado score of eight to nine or higher rules in the diagnosis. The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) did not identify clinically useful low- or high-risk groups at typical pretest probabilities.

The only laboratory tests that are needed in the initial evaluation for acute appendicitis is a complete CBC to determine if there is shift to the left, that is to say, stabs or bands (more than 5%) or increased segmented neutrophils (more than 75%) since they are elevated in the early stages of the inflammatory process. Then, several hours later, there is an increase of the whole number of leucocytes and you will find a leukocytosis of more than 10.000/ml. A urinalysis is useful to determine if there is acetone which indicates a fasting state related to anorexia, and also it may show a few red blood cells due to an inflammatory process around the appendix. If the urine shows too many red cells it may point to a ureteral calculus and further investigation should be done. The C-reactive protein test is not enclosed in my score because it is a non-specific test that detects an inflammatory process only and is not diagnostic for any particular condition. Besides this, it would be a redundancy because the shift to the left and leukocytosis are doing the same thing.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### International consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome: executive summary-workgroup report of the adverse reactions to foods committee, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^114Y9iSj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — laboratory and stool findings note that patients with chronic FPIES can have anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased white blood cell count with a left shift and eosinophilia, frequently prompting sepsis evaluation; thrombocytosis was reported in 65% of patients in one acute series; metabolic acidosis and methemoglobinemia have been reported in acute and chronic FPIES; in acute FPIES with diarrhea, stool may contain frank or occult blood, mucus, leukocytes, and increased carbohydrate content, whereas in infants with chronic FPIES with diarrhea, stool examination can reveal occult blood, neutrophils, eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and/or reducing substances.

### Combining intermediate levels of the endotoxin activity assay (EAA) with other biomarkers in the assessment of patients with sepsis: results of an observational study [^114fGDz8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- High Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA) levels (≥ 0.6) can be used to help diagnose sepsis due to Gram-negative infections.

- Low EAA levels (< 0.4) can be used to rule out Gram-negative infections.

- Procalcitonin levels and presence of shift to the left of white blood cells (WBCs) show differences between Gram-negative infection and no Gram-negative infection in intermediate EAA levels.

- Combining procalcitonin and differential of WBCs can help to diagnosis sepsis in intermediate EAA levels.

### Diagnostic value of laboratory tests in identifying serious infections in febrile children: systematic review [^11186QHs]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To collate all available evidence on the diagnostic value of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of serious infections in febrile children in ambulatory settings.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Electronic databases, reference tracking, and consultation with experts.

Study Selection

Studies were selected on six criteria: design (studies of diagnostic accuracy or deriving prediction rules), participants (otherwise healthy children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years), setting (first contact ambulatory care), outcome (serious infection), features assessed (in first contact care), and data reported (sufficient to construct a 2×2 table).

Data Extraction

Quality assessment was based on the quality assessment tool of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) criteria. Meta-analyses were done using the bivariate random effects method and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves for studies with multiple thresholds.

Data Synthesis

None of the 14 studies identified were of high methodological quality and all were carried out in an emergency department or paediatric assessment unit. The prevalence of serious infections ranged from 4.5% to 29.3%. Tests were carried out for C reactive protein (five studies), procalcitonin (three), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (one), interleukins (two), white blood cell count (seven), absolute neutrophil count (two), band count (three), and left shift (one). The tests providing most diagnostic value were C reactive protein and procalcitonin. Bivariate random effects meta-analysis (five studies, 1379 children) for C reactive protein yielded a pooled positive likelihood ratio of 3.15 (95% confidence interval 2.67 to 3.71) and a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.33 (0.22 to 0.49). To rule in serious infection, cut-off levels of 2 ng/mL for procalcitonin (two studies, positive likelihood ratio 13.7, 7.4 to 25.3 and 3.6, 1.4 to 8.9) and 80 mg/L for C reactive protein (one study, positive likelihood ratio 8.4, 5.1 to 14.1) are recommended; lower cut-off values of 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin or 20 mg/L for C reactive protein are necessary to rule out serious infection. White blood cell indicators are less valuable than inflammatory markers for ruling in serious infection (positive likelihood ratio 0.87–2.43), and have no value for ruling out serious infection (negative likelihood ratio 0.61–1.14). The best performing clinical decision rule (recently validated in an independent dataset) combines testing for C reactive protein, procalcitonin, and urinalysis and has a positive likelihood ratio of 4.92 (3.26 to 7.43) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.02 to 0.27).

Conclusion

Measuring inflammatory markers in an emergency department setting can be diagnostically useful, but clinicians should apply different cut-off values depending on whether they are trying to rule in or rule out serious infection. Measuring white blood cell count is less useful for ruling in serious infection and not useful for ruling out serious infection. More rigorous studies are needed, including studies in primary care, to assess the value of laboratory tests alongside clinical diagnostic measurements, including vital signs.

Table 3
Diagnostics for differentiation of de-novo lymphoid BP and Ph-positive ALL.

indifferent, + positive result, - negative result, ↓ declining, ~ divergent reduction.

pCML-WP recommendation

To date, no single marker unambiguously differentiates de novo CML-BP from Ph + ALL in all cases at the time of diagnosis. In such cases, additional parameters must be obtained after therapy commences (Table 3). A high leukocyte count, left-shifted myeloid maturation, or an increased basophil or eosinophil count at diagnosis and the presence of a major transcript type are indicative, but not conclusive, in diagnosing de novo CML-BP. The panel, therefore, recommends using real-time PCR for BCR::ABL1 and IgH/TCR or flow cytometry markers (if identifiable at diagnosis) in parallel to monitor response to therapy. The accuracy of diagnosis should then be reevaluated as therapy proceeds if a divergence between the clonal markers and BCR::ABL1 transcript levels is detected. The clear detection of BCR::ABL1 in neutrophils by interphase FISH is confirmatory for CML-BP.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^111LNEjD]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy and osteomyelitis — diagnostic approach emphasizes that in a warm, edematous, erythematous, insensate foot, plain radiographs are invaluable in ascertaining presence of osteoarthropathy and, in most cases, no further imaging studies are required, but with a concomitant wound it may be difficult to differentiate acute Charcot arthropathy from osteomyelitis using plain radiographs alone; laboratory studies note that the white blood cell count with a left shift will often be elevated in acute osteomyelitis, whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are often nonspecific; technetium bone scans are generally nonspecific while indium scanning has been shown to be more specific, and additional studies include Tc HMPAO-labeled whole blood cell scans, MRI, and PET scanning; bone biopsy is the most specific method to distinguish osteomyelitis from osteoarthropathy, and a biopsy consisting of multiple shards of bone and soft tissue embedded in deep synovium is pathognomonic for neuropathic osteoarthropathy; other serologic support includes that 1CTP (carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen) is elevated without increased PICP, but maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion in a neuropathic patient with a swollen or deformed foot remains most important.

### Isolated elevated blood neutrophil concentration at altitude does not require NICU admission if appropriate reference ranges are used [^112QC68F]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The Intermountain Healthcare hospitals use a clinical pathway algorithm for early-onset infection, which is based on the 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for perinatal group B streptococcal disease. As part of this pathway, neonates in the well baby nursery, who seem to be well but have risk factors for infection, receive a 'limited laboratory evaluation including a CBC', and if the complete blood cell count (CBC) is abnormal, antibiotic treatment and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitoring are initiated. We recently found that reference ranges for absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) are much wider at our altitude (4800 to 5000 ft) than at sea level. On this basis, we speculated that some well babies with risk factors for infection are mistakenly judged as having an abnormal CBC, and are unnecessarily admitted to the NICU.

Study Design

This was a retrospective observational cohort study of neonates of > 37 weeks gestation admitted to either of two Intermountain Healthcare NICUs for intravenous antibiotic treatment during a recent 36-month period.

Results

During the study period 3217 patients were admitted to the two NICUs, 1049 (32.6%) of which were born at > 37 weeks gestation. Of these, 14 (1.3%) were found to have been admitted to the NICU on the basis of an abnormal CBC (elevated ANC), when in retrospect, using the appropriate ANC chart, their CBCs were completely normal. None of the 14 neonates had a leukocyte left shift (immature to total neutrophil ratio > 0.3) or thrombocytopenia. None were treated with supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation in the NICU. All 14 had sterile blood cultures. All had antibiotics stopped in 48 to 72 h, and all were discharged home as well babies.

Conclusion

We identified 14 neonates who, while in the well baby nursery, were found to have risk factors for early-onset infection, but did not seem to be infected, and were subsequently admitted to a NICU for intravenous antibiotic treatment and monitoring under the mistaken impression that they had an abnormal CBC. We maintain that use of an appropriate neutrophil reference range chart can reduce NICU admissions and can limit unnecessary antibiotic exposure.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^116TQP8o]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is amongst the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world. The early detection and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the initial signs and symptoms of sepsis are frequently non-specific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic characteristics of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not useful in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of SIRS. An elevated white blood count, neutrophilia or eosinopenia are frequently used to diagnose bacterial sepsis; however, these variables have low diagnostic value.

### Bacteremic elder emergency department patients: procalcitonin and white count [^11252Nrt]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess serum procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cell (WBC) count in detecting bacteremia in elder emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

A prospective, observational study of ED patients aged ≥ 65 years in whom blood cultures were drawn was conducted at an urban, tertiary care, academic ED. Serum for PCT and WBC count was obtained at the time of ED visit. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, proportions, and likelihood ratios were calculated.

Results

One hundred eight patients met entry criteria, 14 with bacteremia. In comparing bacteremic patients versus all others, PCT > 0.2 ng/mL was 93% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI] = 79% to 100%) and 38% specific (95% CI = 28% to 48%) with a negative likelihood ratio (LR(-)) of 0.18. Abnormal WBC count was 64% sensitive (95% CI = 39% to 89%) and 54% specific (95% CI = 44% to 64%) with an LR(-) of 0.78. The presence of either abnormal WBC count or left shift was 93% sensitive (95% CI = 74% to 100%) but 11% specific (95% CI = 4% to 11%) with an LR(-) of 0.64. When considering only bacteremic patients versus noninfected patients, PCT at a cutoff of 0.2 ng/mL had an LR(-) of 0.12. Area under a ROC curve was significantly greater for PCT (0.7; 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.9) than for abnormal WBC count (0.5; 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.7; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

In elder ED patients, a PCT level of 0.2 ng/mL is sensitive for bacteremia and, based on its negative likelihood ratio, is moderately helpful in ruling out the diagnosis. WBC count with or without left shift performed poorly in the diagnosis of bacteremia.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^116bSyJr]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In interpreting WBC counts, physicians should consider recent initiation of steroids and their dosage. While increases of as much as 4.84 × 10⁹ cells may be seen 48 h after initiating large doses, larger increases, increases following a daily dose of 320 mg or less of hydrocortisone equivalent, and increases greater than 1 × 10⁹ cells occurring within 24 h post‐steroid initiation should trigger concern for other causes of leukocytosis.

### The utility of discharge antibiotics in pediatric perforated appendicitis without leukocytosis [^116TjsCJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimal management of pediatric perforated appendicitis remains a topic of active investigation. Our institutional clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were modified to discontinue antibiotics on discharge for patients with normal white blood cell count (WBC) without left shift. We hypothesized that patients would receive fewer antibiotics without increased complications.

Methods

Patients < 18 y old with perforated appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between November 1, 2016 and May 31, 2021 at a tertiary care children's hospital were included. Primary outcome was adverse events: postdischarge surgical site infection (SSI), 30-day emergency department (ED) visits, or readmissions. Outcomes were compared before and after CPG modification. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with SSI.

Results

There were 113 patients pre- and 97 patients post-CPG modification. 23.1% of patients in the pre-cohort had an elevated discharge WBC or left shift compared to 18.9% of patients in the post-cohort (P = 0.48). Significantly fewer patients were prescribed antibiotics on discharge in the post-cohort (70.8% pre versus 14.4% post, P < 0.0001) and for fewer days (2 pre versus 0 post, P < 0.0001). Total antibiotic days decreased significantly (6.1 pre versus 4.6 post, P < 0.0001). There was an increase in postdischarge SSIs on univariate analysis (1.8% pre versus 9.3% post, P = 0.03), ED visits (9.7% pre versus 19.6% post, P = 0.04), and readmissions (5.3% pre versus 11.3% post, P = 0.13). On multivariable analysis, being in the post-cohort was not significantly associated with post-discharge SSIs after adjusting for sex, symptom duration, initial WBC, and discharge antibiotic duration (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04–1.4, P = 0.11).

Conclusions

Modification of a pediatric perforated appendicitis clinical practice guideline to discontinue antibiotics on discharge with a normal WBC without left shift was effective in decreasing antibiotic duration. This was associated with an increase in SSIs on univariate analysis, which did not persist on multivariable analysis and requires further investigation.

### Comparing automated vs manual leukocyte differential counts for quantifying the 'left shift' in the blood of neonates [^116i3FV8]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The neutrophil 'left shift' can be measured via the immature to total (I/T) neutrophil ratio or the absolute bands per μl using a manual differential count. It can also be measured from an automated differential count by the immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) or the absolute IG per μl. In neonates, it is unknown if the manual or automated differential count is superior.

Study Design

We directly compared complete blood counts (CBCs) with manual and automated differential counts from infants < 90 days old, and documented whether or not each neonate was infected. We developed reference intervals for I/T ratio, bands per μl, IG% and IG per μl using values from non-infected neonates.

Results

The database had 10714 CBCs. The upper reference interval for I/T ratio was 0.29 in the first 48h and 0.31 thereafter; bands per μl was 3710μl(-1) in the first 48h and 1785μl(-1) thereafter. IG% was 6.2% then 4.2%; IG per μl was 1460μl(-1) then 613μl(-1). Statistical performances of the four methods were equivalent for identifying infection.

Conclusions

We developed reference intervals for four methods of quantifying a neonate's 'left shift'. The information from automated differentials is not inferior to that from manual differentials in identifying infections, but automated differentials have the advantages of a larger sample size, being less expensive, and faster performance times.

### Mifepristone (Mifeprex) [^111C5oZi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL INFECTIONS OR BLEEDING

Serious and sometimes fatal infections and bleeding occur very rarely following spontaneous, surgical, and medical abortions, including following MIFEPREX use. No causal relationship between the use of MIFEPREX and misoprostol and these events has been established.

Atypical Presentation of Infection. Patients with serious bacterial infections (e.g. Clostridium sordellii) and sepsis can present without fever, bacteremia, or significant findings on pelvic examination following an abortion. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out serious infection and sepsis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Bleeding. Prolonged heavy bleeding may be a sign of incomplete abortion or other complications and prompt medical or surgical intervention may be needed. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience prolonged heavy vaginal bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Because of the risks of serious complications described above, MIFEPREX is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Mifepristone REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Marked elevation of cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count: an unusual case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, differential diagnosis, and a brief review of current epidemiology and treatment recommendations [^112BAP2M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is rarely a difficult diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Unfortunately for the practicing clinician, patients are rarely that straightforward. Patients who are elderly, very young, or immuno-compromised often present with subtle findings, making the correct diagnosis a challenge. In addition, patients being treated with antibiotics may be misleading in their clinical presentation, leading to a missed diagnosis of meningitis. Only when one considers the diagnosis or obtains a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is the correct diagnosis made. Although the clinical scenario may suggest meningitis, it is the cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count that establishes the definitive diagnosis. Despite the advent of systemic antibiotics over 50 years ago, bacterial meningitis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The following case report details a woman diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with an extremely high cerebrospinal white blood cell count. Although this is typically thought to be caused by abscesses or malignancy, meningitis alone may cause such an elevation. In addition, a brief review of the current epidemiology and treatment regimens for meningitis is discussed.

### A case of primary meningococcal pericarditis caused by Neisseria meningitidis serotype Y with rapid evolution into cardiac tamponade [^113BnRYv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary meningococcal pericarditis (PMP) is a rare form of acute purulent pericarditis that often evolves into cardiac tamponade and usually requires pericardial drainage. PMP is a rare, difficult to diagnose, rapidly progressive form of meningococcal infections. PMP is typically caused by Neisseria meningitidis of serotype C, or, less commonly, B or W135. We report the second case of PMP caused by Neisseria meningitidis of serotype Y. Our patient was not critically ill at presentation, and her presentation could have been consistent with viral uncomplicated pericarditis with the exception of the mild leukocytosis with a left shift in the differential. Clinicians should be aware that early in the course of PMP, the illness may not be severe. Mild leukocytosis with a left shift or bandemia in the setting of what otherwise seems to be a case of uncomplicated viral pericarditis should prompt suspicion for PMP and further evaluation and/or monitoring.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^113TaMw9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is an organ dysfunction characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection(s). Although its associated mortality rate is high, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can improve outcomes. Diagnosis is made according to the Sepsis-3 criteria. Although biomarkers, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6, are helpful for diagnosis, they are relatively expensive tests and not always available. When necessary, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, source control, oxygenation, and early empirical antibiotic therapy are the main approaches to sepsis management. Excessive or incorrect use of empirical antibiotics, however, should be considered in terms of treatment optimization and the development of antibiotic resistance.

Immature granulocytes (IGs) are a subset of neutrophils (metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes), and are produced in the bone marrow prompted by stimuli such as inflammation or infection. IGs are less mature cells than band cells and are usually present at lower levels. The ability to automatically determine percentage of IGs using modern analyzers enables faster and more precise measurement of left shift. Although many studies have been performed to determine the optimal cut-off value, there is no clear consensus.

As such, this study aimed to determine the role of IG% in predicting the response to microbiological treatment(s) for sepsis.

### Human acute inflammatory recovery is defined by co-regulatory dynamics of white blood cell and platelet populations [^112ro5au]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 4
The conserved WBC-PLT trajectory shape provides a generic benchmark for personalized patient risk assessment.

WBC-PLT position and direction provide an integrated trajectory-based risk metric. Two patient examples are provided, one involving recovery of an initially high-risk patient (a, Patient 1), and the other involving deterioration of an initially stable patient (a, Patient 2). See main text for case details. b Across the entire validation cohort, retrospective trajectory-based assessment identified patients during hospitalization at high risk of mortality and prolonged length of stay (LOS). Position and direction jointly contribute to risk, with patients outside the 80th percentile for both position and direction having elevated likelihood of poor outcomes. Compared to patients with good position and direction (< 50th percentile), patients with poor position and direction (> 80th percentile) on post-op day 4 had a 33-fold increased relative risk of adverse outcomes (CI: 13–79, 53% vs 1.6%) and stayed an average of 13 days longer in hospital. c For other inflammatory stimuli studied, positional and directional deviation were similarly associated with significant increases in relative risks of adverse outcomes for patients with sufficient data available: 10x for adverse outcomes following hip replacement, 9x for colectomy, 9x for mortality from COVID-19, and 5x for mortality from myocardial infarction. See "Methods" for more details. See Supplementary Fig. 16 for risk stratification for other cohorts and Supplementary Figs. 17–22 and Supplementary Table 9 for position and direction and outcome likelihoods across the first 7 days post-op. Position and direction thresholds were calculated from the exploratory cohort, and outcome rates from the validation cohort. Position percentiles were calculated treating WBC below and PLT above the mean as non-contributing. Source data are provided as a Source data file. WBC: white blood cell count, PLT: platelet count.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^112LcGGW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The complete blood count is a cornerstone of modern clinical evaluationand has been shown in many studies to have surprising and unexplained associations with adverse outcomes particularly in acute inflammatory states –, but this prognostic information is often unfamiliar to physicians and represents unrealized clinical value. Based on analysis of patient cohorts at three different clinical sites, this study identifies PWR as a convenient summary of patient inflammatory state in rapidly changing acute care settings.

Infection, ischemia, and trauma all trigger inflammatory responses that mobilize WBC and consume PLT with feedback to WBC and PLT proliferation rates. Healthy individuals mount an effective response, and their WBC and PLT populations tend to recover along a universal WBC-PLT trajectory. PWR provides a single marker encapsulation of these dynamics, reducing this WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with abnormally low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, persistent WBC elevation, or both. Low PWR may reflect dysregulation between PLT and WBC populations analogous to the way elevated RDW can reflect perturbations to red cell homeostasis and provide prognostic information on short-term risk –. The consistency of these changes across heterogeneous acute inflammatory settingssuggests that PWR may succinctly quantify key aspects of inflammatory regulation and recovery, and that PWR changes may occur as part of, or in tandem with a normal inflammatory response and recovery. Other non-inflammatory processes that alter WBC or PLT will also influence PWR and may limit its prognostic utility in inflammatory states. The consistency of PWR's stronger association with short-term mortality compared to other CBC-derived markers in 4 heterogenous study cohorts across two medical centers and in a general surgical cohort from a third independent medical center supports the prior finding of universal WBC-PLT dynamics during recovery from acute inflammatory stimuli. This mechanistic explanation, for the associated prognostic signal may facilitate clinical utilization.

### Mifepristone (Mifeprex) [^113W4STN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infection and Sepsis

As with other types of abortion, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of MIFEPREX [see Boxed Warning]. Healthcare providers evaluating a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion should be alert to the possibility of this rare event. A sustained (> 4 hours) fever of 100.4°F or higher, severe abdominal pain, or pelvic tenderness in the days after a medical abortion may be an indication of infection.

A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out sepsis (e.g., from Clostridium sordellii) if a patient reports abdominal pain or discomfort or general malaise (including weakness, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. No causal relationship between MIFEPREX and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been established. Clostridium sordellii infections have also been reported very rarely following childbirth (vaginal delivery and caesarian section), and in other gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions.

### Utility of immature granulocyte percentage in pediatric appendicitis [^115CiN6W]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal surgery in children. Adjuncts are used to help clinicians predict acute or perforated appendicitis, which may affect treatment decisions. Automated hematologic analyzers can perform more accurate automated differentials including immature granulocyte percentages (IG%). Elevated IG% has demonstrated improved accuracy for predicting sepsis in the neonatal population than traditional immature-to-total neutrophil count ratios. We intended to assess the additional discriminatory ability of IG% to traditionally assessed parameters in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.

Materials and Methods

We identified all patients with appendicitis from July 2012-June 2013 by International Classification of Diseases-9 code. Charts were reviewed for relevant demographic, clinical, and outcome data, which were compared between acute and perforated appendicitis groups using Fisher exact and t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We used an adjusted logistic regression model using clinical laboratory values to predict the odds of perforated appendicitis.

Results

A total of 251 patients were included in the analysis. Those with perforated appendicitis had a higher white blood cell count (P = 0.0063), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.0001), and IG% (P = 0.0299). In the adjusted model, only elevated CRP (odds ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 1.40–8.54) and presence of left shift (odds ratio 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.09–6.46) were significant predictors of perforated appendicitis. The c-statistic of the final model was 0.70, suggesting fair discriminatory ability in predicting perforated appendicitis.

Conclusions

IG% did not provide any additional benefit to elevated CRP and presence of left shift in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.

### Filgrastim-txid (Nypozi) [^114Wwjxv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily), subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however, the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift), including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### Prognostic significance of early molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^113KgwHE]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man presented with splenomegaly (10 cm below left costal margin) and leucocytosis (145 × 10⁹/L). Differential showed neutrophilia with increased basophils (2%), eosinophils (1.5%), and left shift including myeloblasts (3%). A diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was established after marrow cytogenetics demonstrated the Philadelphia chromosome. Molecular studies showed a BCR-ABL1 qPCR result of 65% on the International Scale. Imatinib therapy at 400 mg daily was initiated due to patient preference, with achievement of complete hematological response after 4 weeks of therapy. BCR-ABL1 at 1 and 3 months after starting therapy was 37% and 13%, respectively (all reported on International Scale). Is this considered an adequate molecular response?

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^112SG5KF]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

After Day 2, WBC values generally declined and then plateaued. In the medium‐ and high‐dose groups, readings were significantly elevated compared to baseline through Day 4 (p = .001, and p < .001, respectively). In the low‐dose group, the mean values did not significantly differ from baseline on Days 3–4. Analyses of ANC and ALC are reported in Supporting Information S1: Figure 1A, B. ANC followed a similar pattern of dose–response with max response on Day 2, followed by a return towards baseline. ALC conversely demonstrated a transient decrease on Day 1 with a subsequent return toward baseline.

The sensitivity analyses removing patients whose dose tertiles changed and whose steroids were discontinued are included in the supplement (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2A–D). Both analyses produced results similar to the main analysis. Patients with and without COPD demonstrated similar trends in WBC counts. Removing outliers did not change the trends observed (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2E), nor did restricting the analysis to only those with CBCs drawn each day (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2F).

Figure 4
Schematic overview of diagnostic criteria and factors influencing the clinicopathological phenotype in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Mutations in driver genes in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia impact upon the clinicopathological phenotype. CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.

MDS/MPN with neutrophilia (MDS/MPN‐N), formerly known as atypical CML, is a myeloid neoplasm with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features characterised by sustained peripheral blood neutrophilia and neutrophilic left shift. ETNK1 and SETBP1 mutations are often found in MDS/MPN‐N and show some specificity for the disease, in particular in the differential diagnosis to the rare MPN entity, chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL), which is characterised by neutrophilia without left shift or dysplasia and by CSF3R mutations. A comprehensive molecular investigation for those genes is indicated in patients with leukocytosis, neutrophilia and/or neutrophilic left shift when BCR::ABL1 as a diagnostic feature for CML has been excluded.

MDS/MPN with SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN‐ SF3B1 ‐T) is a myeloid neoplasm with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, characterised by SF3B1 mutation, ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. The typical molecular pattern of MDS/MPN‐ SF3B1 ‐T is a SF3B1 mutation with a concomitant JAK/STAT pathway mutation — in particular JAK2 p.V617F, that can be found in half the patients; also, rarely MPL and CALR. The interplay of a SF3B1 mutation associated with a myelodysplastic phenotype (in particular ring sideroblast), and a JAK2 mutation associated with a myeloproliferative phenotype (i.e. thrombocytosis) neatly exemplifies the molecular pattern characteristic for overlap of MDS and MPN. Given this underlying biology, it is tempting to query whether iron staining and detection of ring sideroblasts is necessary in such cases. Arguably, the role of these diagnostic tools remains relevant when molecular analyses are unavailable.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation‚ differentiation commitment‚ and some end-cell functional activation.

Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage.

### Comparison of hematologic abnormalities between hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 positive and negative patients with correlation to disease severity and outcome [^112HHxRy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are diverse and have been reported in the literature in the form of case series with relatively smaller sample sizes and with a handful of studies showing the association between PBS and clinical severity. This study aims to highlight the numerical and morphological changes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and to compare the same in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings as well as with disease severity and outcome. The study included 80 COVID-19 positive (41 ICU and 39 non-ICU) patients and 32 COVID-19 negative ICU patients. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and PBS findings were studied and scored by two pathologists blindfolded. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) were significantly lower in COVID-19 positive cases as compared to the COVID-19 negative group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001). COVID-19 positive group showed significant left myeloid shift (p = 0.021), Dohle bodies (p = 0.025) with significant prominence of acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly, ring-shaped neutrophils, monolobate neutrophils, and plasmacytoid lymphocytes as compared to control group (p = 0.000, p = 0.009, p = 0.046, and p = 0.011, respectively). The overall mean white blood cell (WBC) counts were higher in COVID-19 positive ICU patients as compared to non-ICU COVID patients with significant shift to left, presence of ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes (p = 0.017, p = 0.007, p = 0.008, and p = 0.004, respectively). Deceased group showed significantly higher WBC count (p = 0.018) with marked neutrophilia (p = 0.024) and toxic granulation (p = 0.01) with prominence of monocyte vacuolization, ring-shaped neutrophils, large granular lymphocytes, and reactive lymphocytes. Parameters like myeloid left shift, ring-shaped neutrophils, monocyte vacuolation, and large granular lymphocytes emerged as highly sensitive markers of disease severity. Therefore, serial CBC with comprehensive PBS analysis should be done in every newly diagnosed hospitalized COVID-19 patient which potentially predicts the course of the disease.

### The diagnosis of acute appendicitis: clinical assessment versus computed tomography evaluation [^113AVbgj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to validate Alvarado's predictive model as a diagnostic test and to assess the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) scan as a supplemental tool in the evaluation of acute appendicitis. Clinical and radiologic data of 215 patients with acute abdominal pain were evaluated. Clinical assessment was based on positive findings of migration of pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tenderness of the lower right quadrant, rebound tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis with a left shift. Evaluation by CT scan had a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 94.1%. Clinical assessment based on the MANTRELS criteria had a sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 84.7%. With the assistance of CT scan, sensitivity and specificity increased to 98.3% and 95.8%, respectively.

### Human acute inflammatory recovery is defined by co-regulatory dynamics of white blood cell and platelet populations [^112jm6X6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Leukocytosis is a cardinal sign of inflammation, but a small fraction of patients with the inflammatory conditions studied do not show elevation in WBC, and some can at times show a decrease. In the cardiac surgery cohort ~0.5% (25/4693) of patients failed to show a WBC increase in the 72 h following surgery; in the MI cohort, 5% (314/6240) had at least one low WBC count during the 72 h following admission; and in sepsis — where timing of peak inflammation may be hard to ascertain — 89% (4209/4730) of patients either exhibited leukocytosis, or a sharp (> 1 unit) WBC increase within a 24 h period at some point during their stay. Future study is needed to investigate whether these atypical muted or decreasing WBC responses are related to treatment or intrinsic to the inflammatory response and whether inflammatory recovery follows a different trajectory in the case of transient leukopenia.

All major results were validated in out-of-sample testing or using cross-validation approaches. Results for the cardiac surgery cohort were replicated in separate cohorts both from the same hospital during different time periods and from a different hospital in the same network, and in subset analyses controlling for surgery type, pre-operative marker levels, and risk profiles. However, this study was limited to retrospective analysis, and some patient cohorts were restricted by the required minimum data availability. Follow-up prospective studies with higher-frequency measurements are needed to define these responses more precisely and to determine whether interventions guided by awareness of this conserved recovery shape will lead to improved patient outcomes. Future work is also warranted to determine whether the shape of the effective inflammatory response identified here is present in other inflammatory settings such as malignancy, autoimmunity, and the resolution of chronic inflammation.

Workup of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — initial evaluation should include a history and physical examination, palpation of spleen, evaluation of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, cardiovascular risk factors, as well as transfusion and medication history. Laboratory evaluations should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, microscopic examination of the peripheral smear, comprehensive metabolic panel with serum uric acid, serum LDH, liver function tests, serum EPO level, and serum iron studies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients with MF for whom allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) would be considered. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on peripheral blood to detect BCR::ABL1 transcripts and exclude the diagnosis of CML is especially recommended for patients with left-shifted leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis with basophilia, and FISH may have better specificity than RT-PCR in the detection of unusual breakpoints.

### QSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis [^113T1bfj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The recently published consensus definitions for sepsis have raised a lot of discussion and controversy. We had the privilege of being part of this consensus group and fully support the final definitions. We are pleased that a definition has been developed that closely reflects everyday clinical language, recognizing that sepsis is most simply described as a "bad infection" associated with some degree of organ dysfunction, as proposed earlier. The article conveying the consensus definition also emphasizes that sepsis is more often recognized from the associated organ dysfunction than from the more difficult to identify infection, so that sepsis can be defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection".

The proposition of the 1992 North American consensus document that sepsis be defined by a combination of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and the presence of an infection raised confusion, because the SIRS criteria (especially fever, tachycardia, and altered white blood cell count) are themselves typical features of infection. As the majority of infected patients will therefore meet the SIRS criteria, they would also be considered to have sepsis by this 1992 definition. This approach to defining sepsis has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of patients diagnosed with sepsis over the years; however, these patients may have less severe disease so that reported parallel reductions in mortality rates may be deceptive. The recent "new" definitions are not so novel, more a return to the traditional use of the term to indicate patients with a substantial and deleterious response to an infection. We doubt that this will change further over time, exactly as the meaning of other words like pneumonia, peritonitis, or meningitis has not changed.

### Evaluation of liver enzymes in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus infected pregnant women [^111Zev2E]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy represents a well known phenomenon, described early on by Rudolf Virchow, that has been very well documented and studied quantitatively. There are also reports that present leukocytosis with marked left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage during the third trimester of normal uncomplicated pregnancy that normalized readily after delivery. It has been reported that the elevated circulating levels of progesterone, especially during the late second and third trimester of pregnancy results in the increased numbers of circulating neutrophils while decreasing lymphocyte proportions, a phenomenon frequently observed in normal pregnancy. Moreover, it has been reported that pregnant women exhibit lower lymphocyte counts than non-pregnant women. Lymphocyte proliferation and activation is a well known phenomenon in patients with viral infections. Recent studies revealed that endogenous factors, such as regulatory T cells, immunosuppressive cytokines, and inhibitory receptors contribute to the impairment of virus-specific T cell responses in chronic HBV infection, perhaps reflecting the host's attempt to protect itself against immune-mediated pathology in a subset of patients. Viremic pregnant women of our study population, exhibited significantly lower absolute numbers of white blood cells and neutrophil counts and significantly higher ALT and GGT values, compared to non-viremic women. Moreover, we observed that the absolute neutrophil count of pregnant women was the only predictor of viremia among HBeAg negative chronic HBV-infected women (the lower the absolute neutrophils count the higher the possibility of detectable viremia). It seems that the presence of viremia affects the well known pregnancy-induced leukocytosis as well as the left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage. The absolute lymphocyte count in viremic chronic HBV-infected pregnant women was higher than the corresponding count in non-viremic ones (2.088 vs. 1.727 respectively, P = 0.808), although not significant, probably because of the major effect of pregnancy per se in the absolute neutrophil count. This finding needs further investigation in large-scale studies.

### When leucocytosis is not leukaemia [^1128Fbe6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A female aged 84 years with a history of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea presented from an extended care facility with altered mental status and respiratory distress. She was haemodynamically unstable and initial laboratory results revealed hyperleucocytosis (110.3×10 9 /L). The presence of immature myeloid precursors, thrombocytopenia and respiratory distress, raised concern for an acute leukaemic process requiring emergent leucapheresis. However, on evaluation of the peripheral smear, prominent left shift and toxic granulation were noted, along with absence of blast cells. Considering her history of C. difficile infection, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which was suggestive of toxic megacolon. She was taken to the operating room for emergent colectomy. The pathology specimen showed pseudomembrane formation consistent with fulminant C. difficile infection. She was treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole, followed by clinical improvement and resolution of leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

Cytological and Cellular Morphology Evaluation of Leukocytes in FMF, FMF-like and p.R202Q Carrier Patients

We evaluated the percentage of neutrophils (N), their stage of maturation, and cytological characteristics in all blood smears from patients and HDs. We found no difference in the percentage of neutrophils (N) between all groups analyzed. Hypersegmented N, cells that have remained in circulation for an extended period instead of migrating into the tissues, were higher in FMF, FMF-like and p.R202Q patients than in HDs (Fig. 6 a). A left shift indicates the presence of immature N in blood and usually indicates an inflammatory leukogram. Band N were higher in p.R202Q patients than in HDs. A moderate shift to the left (0.2–0.29) and severe shift to the left (≥ 0.3) were observed in 2 p.R202Q patients and in 1 K695R het patient, and this index was higher in p.R202Q patients than in HDs. Finally, no differences were observed in the rate of M and binucleated M between all groups included in the study (Fig. 6 b).

### Flow cytometric findings in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^116pjSFJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an often fatal hyperinflammatory syndrome. HLH may be inherited, but it more commonly arises secondary to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or other infections, hematologic malignancies, or rheumatologic diseases. We identified 17 patients diagnosed with HLH who had flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow performed at the time of diagnosis. Two patients had primary HLH, and the others had HLH secondary to EBV infection, hematologic malignancies, rheumatologic conditions, or tuberculosis. The marrow typically showed a reactive lymphocytosis and a marked left shift in myelopoiesis regardless of the etiology. Qualitative abnormalities were also found in several cases, including T-cell abnormalities in the majority of the EBV-associated HLH cases. While not specific, flow cytometric findings in HLH are different from the findings in uninvolved marrow samples, and care should be taken not to overinterpret immunophenotypic findings in these cases as indicative of a primary marrow disorder or lymphoma.

### Granulocyte abundance and maturation state at diagnosis predicts treatment-free remission in CML [^11135fg4]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to overproduction of granulocytes, we found evidence that patients maintaining TFR showed a predominance of mature over immature granulocytes. Non-relapsing patients were characterized with neutrophils that demonstrated more variation in nuclear segmentation and shift towards nuclear hypersegmentation, indicating more mature neutrophils. In contrast, relapsed patients harbored more promyelocytes with elliptic nuclei and metamyelocytes with rounder nuclei. Cytomorphological examination of promyelocytes did not demonstrate clear signs of maturation based on the cell size or cytoplasm. However, increased ellipticity may indicate a shift toward myelocytes with more banded nuclei.

We also found that morphological changes were associated with cell proportions. Higher promyelocyte nuclei ellipticity was associated with elevated promyelocytes and could reflect a shift in proliferation or maturation. Neutrophil and metamyelocyte morphology were associated with metamyelocyte proportion. This could be explained with the left shift phenomenon where maturing metamyelocytes and band neutrophils become enriched in clinical conditions associated with reactive neutrophilia. Analogical to this, round-shaped nuclei in metamyelocytes could reflect similar phenomenon of metamyelocytes from myelocytes.

### Paraneoplastic leukemoid reactions induced by cytokine-secreting tumours [^115LmmX1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing LR from CNL

In contrast to LRs, the neutrophilia in CNL is characterised by the lack of left shift. Segmented neutrophils constitute most of the cells. The more immature granulocytic precursors and nucleated erythrocytes are infrequent to find. However, it is important to mention that features of reactive granulocytosis can infrequently be seen in CNL, making the distinction challenging. The morphological overlap between PLR and CNL can likely be explained by the mechanistic similarity of these two processes. G-CSF is the ligand for colony-stimulating factor three receptor (CSF3R). In CNL, mutations in the CSF3R gene lead to constitutive activation of downstream signalling protein mediators, leading to granulocytic proliferation. In PLR, the ligand (G-CSF) is markedly increased which will lead to a similar end result.

Bone marrow examination and ancillary testing

Marrow examination in patients with PLR usually shows hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, and no increase in blasts percentage. Left shifted myelopoiesis with toxic granulation can be also seen (figures 3 and 4). Erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes are usually unremarkable. The characteristic 'dwarf' megacaryocytes of CML are not seen. Cytogenetic and molecular studies must be negative for the known molecular drivers of MPNs (BCR/ABL1, CSF3R, TET2, SRSF2, SETPB1 and ASXL1).

Cytokine blood level

Testing for the suspected cytokine plasma level (G-CSF, GM-CSF, ILs or TNF-α) can be accomplished through enzyme immunoassays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. However, these tests are not offered in many institutions.

Histological examination of the CST

Based on our knowledge, all reported PLRs occurred in the setting of malignant tumours. CSTs tend to have a higher grade and a lesser degree of differentiation than other tumours. Most reported tumours are poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. Dense intra-tumoural neutrophilic infiltration is a characteristic morphologic finding (figure 5).CST cells show diffuse cytoplasmic staining with immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining with G-CSF or GM-CSF antibody. However, some CSTs can stain negative even if their CSF-secreting ability has been confirmed by elevated CSF plasma levels.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^1169JEG2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical method

Here I am presenting my own method for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis which has been proved to be helpful in many studies around the world. The method relies on a combination of factors derived from physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests. The method uses a simple mnemonics (MANTRELS) that is easy to remember and can be applied in many settings without the need of a computer. This mnemonics makes the method even easier to follow: First you check for the three main symptoms: Migration, Anorexia, and Nausea or vomiting; then you follow with the signs which are: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, Rebound pain (Blumberg sign) and Elevation of the temperature (oral temperature of 37.3 C or more); and finally, you do the lab tests, essentially a CBC to look for Leukocytosis and Shift to the left (increased Stabs or Segmented neutrophils), and a urinalysis to look for acetone as an indication of anorexia if it is not clinically apparent. Rebound pain can be replaced with other indirect signs such as the Rovsing sign and also with the Dunphy's sign (cough test) or the Markle's test (heel-drop jarring test). Another indirect sign that can replace the rebound pain is tenderness by gentle direct percussion with the fist, as a mallet, on the right lumbar area in cases of a retrocecal acute appendicitis. In order of decreasing importance the eight best predicting factors proved to be: Localized tenderness on the right lower quadrant, leukocytosis, migration of pain, shift to the left, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia or acetone in the urine and direct rebound pain. I assigned a value of 2 to each of the two of the more important factors tenderness and leukocytosis), and a value of 1 to each one of the others, for a possible total score of 10. A score of 5 or 6 is compatible with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable appendicitis, and a score of 9 or 10 indicates a very probable appendicitis. To this score the clinician could subtract 2 points if the patient complains of headache because this symptom is very rare in cases of acute appendicitis. In this particular situation the patient may need further investigation to rule out a different disorder. Scores of five or six are in a grey area, and in this case, you may want to observe the patient for a short time (reevaluate every four to six hours) for 12 or 24 h and if the score stays the same consider other tests such as ultrasound or diagnostic laparoscopy. When the score is three or four, the clinician has two options: This could represent a very early stage of an acute appendicitis so the clinician could keep the patient under observation and repeat the tests, or even more, order additional tests such as an US or CT scan if they are available in that particular setting. Another option is to rely on his clinical impression because, as I already mentioned in my original article, "there is always an intangible ingredient in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. If there is any question about the diagnosis, more physical examinations and laboratory tests should be performed and the patient should be evaluated every four or six hours, preferably in the hospital". If the score remains the same or increases after this evaluation, the patient may need surgery. As we can see the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is a dynamic process that go hand to hand with the pathological changes of the disease. As we all know, medicine is a combination of science and art, both of them equally important in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, so we cannot discard one of them in favor of the other. It is for this reason that we cannot depend on the technological advances only but we should use our common sense and clinical experience to arrive to a correct diagnosis.

### Neutrophil CD64 is an improved indicator of infection or sepsis in emergency department patients [^116FnwYp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Sepsis, affecting millions of individuals annually with an associated high mortality rate, is among the top 10 causes of death. In addition, improvements in diagnostic tests for detecting and monitoring sepsis and infection have been limited in the last 25 years. Neutrophil CD64 expression has been proposed as an improved diagnostic test for the evaluation of infection and sepsis.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a quantitative flow cytometric assay for leukocyte CD64 expression in comparison with the standard tests for infection/sepsis in an ambulatory care setting.

Design

Prospective analysis of 100 blood samples from patients from an emergency department setting in a 965-bed tertiary care suburban community hospital was performed for neutrophil CD64 expression, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complete blood count. The laboratory findings were compared with a clinical score for the likelihood of infection/sepsis, which was obtained by a blinded retrospective chart review.

Results

The diagnostic performance, as gauged by the clinical score, varied with neutrophil CD64 (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 71.2%, efficiency 76.8%) and outperformed C-reactive protein (sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 59.4%, efficiency 69.4%), absolute neutrophil count (sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 50.8%, efficiency 53.8%), myeloid left shift (sensitivity 68.2%, specificity 76.3%, efficiency 73.3%), and sedimentation rate (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 65.5%, efficiency 61.0%).

Conclusion

Neutrophil CD64 expression quantitation provides improved diagnostic detection of infection/sepsis compared with the standard diagnostic tests used in current medical practice.

### Acute hyperviscosity: syndromes and management [^1153sdGc]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Plasma hyperviscosity is a rare complication of both monoclonal and polyclonal disorders associated with elevation of immunoglobulins. Asymptomatic patients with an elevation in the serum viscosity do not require plasma exchange, and the majority will have other indications for therapeutic intervention. For patients with hemorrhagic or central nervous system manifestations, plasma exchange is the therapy of choice and is relatively safe. Viscosity measurements are not required to initiate therapy if the index of suspicion is high and the clinical presentation is typical. However, patients should have a sample sent for confirmation of the diagnosis. Whole-blood hyperviscosity is seen in patients with extreme elevation of the red cell and white cell count. Phlebotomy of patients with primary and secondary elevation of the red cell count is a well-established therapy.

Q fever — laboratory findings indicate that although up to 25% of patients with acute Q fever have an increased leukocyte count, most patients have normal white blood cell counts. Mild thrombocytopenia in early illness, which occurs in approximately one third of patients, might be followed by subsequent thrombocytosis. The most common laboratory abnormalities are increased liver enzyme levels, which are observed in up to 85% of cases, and hyperbilirubinemia occurs in one in five patients. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly also might be present, although jaundice is rare.

### Human acute inflammatory recovery is defined by co-regulatory dynamics of white blood cell and platelet populations [^115p22Tv]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

WBC-PLT trajectory-based patient risk assessment

Deviation from the direction of the favorable recovery trajectory shape is associated with elevated risk of adverse outcomes following cardiac surgery (Fig. 1d), and WBC-PLT position can also be considered to provide an integrated trajectory-based risk assessment. Illustrating this approach to individual patient risk assessment, the left panel of Fig. 4a plots the hospital course of a 55-year-old female with a prior mechanical aortic valve replacement and high STS pre-operative risk of mortality (PROM), (10%, 95th percentile). Repeat sternotomy for aortic valve replacement was complicated by intra-operative bleeding and hypotension requiring rapid transfusion and resuscitation, but the post-op recovery was otherwise smooth. Daily comparison of the patient's WBC-PLT position and direction yields a high initial risk that steadily declines as WBC normalizes, and the trajectory merges quickly with the reference shape of recovery. In contrast, the right panel of Fig. 4a illustrates the clinical course for an 84-year-old female with a history of angina and moderate PROM (2.6%, 75th percentile) who initially recovered well after successful three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Counts normalized by post-op day 4, but the rising WBC and subtly declining PLT thereafter nevertheless correspond to a marked deviation from the favorable trajectory and a sharp rise in directional risk. On post-op day 6, she developed fever and shortness of breath leading to a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and initiation of heparin. A precipitous interval decline in PLT on day 7 led to diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, intensive care unit readmission, and a subsequent prolonged hospital stay of 1 month. These two cases illustrate how the WBC-PLT recovery shape can be used to identify high-risk patients who recover smoothly, as well as to detect smoldering issues which precede adverse events. For the cardiac surgery cohort overall, patients outside the 80th percentiles of position and direction had a relative risk of adverse outcomes of 32 on day 3 (CI: 13–79, 1.4–44%) and 33 on day 4 (CI: 15–75, 1.6–53%). Extending this analysis to the other inflammatory scenarios studied revealed significant relative risks: 9.2 (2.7–31.2, 4.3–40%) for death from COVID-19, 4.9 (3.1–7.6, 5.8–28%) for death following myocardial infarction, and 10.1 (CI: 4–26, 5–50%) for hip replacement, with all results from out-of-sample testing (Fig. 4c). In the validation cardiac surgery cohort, 97% (29/30) of deaths occurred in patients whose day 4 position or direction was above the 80th percentile, with 83% (25/30) occurring in patients with both position and direction above the 80th percentile. Corresponding specificities were 71% (865/1226) and 92% (1125/1226). Further risk analysis in the cardiac surgery cohort illustrated that consideration of the one-dimensional PLT/WBC ratio, or of PLT and WBC in isolation produced a significantly weaker risk stratification than the dynamic two-dimensional approach (Supplementary Table 4).

### Circadian expression of migratory factors establishes lineage-specific signatures that guide the homing of leukocyte subsets to tissues [^114pDcTX]. Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Rhythmic Emigration of Leukocyte Subsets from Blood

Circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts oscillate in murine blood such that they exhibit a peak 5 hr after the onset of light (also known as Zeitgeber time [ZT] 5, i.e. 5 hr after lights on [12 p.m.] in a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark environment) and a trough in the evening (ZT13 or 8 p.m. 1 hr after lights off) (Figure 1 A). Numbers of neutrophils, B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, eosinophils, and inflammatory and non-inflammatory monocytes showed similar peaks and troughs with a 2- to 7-fold change in numbers between the peak and trough depending on the subset (Figure 1 A, Figure S1 A, and data not shown). We investigated whether a rhythmic leukocyte emigration process could explain the observed oscillations in blood. As an initial screen, we performed "negative" homing assays, where 1 hr after adoptively transferring leukocytes intravenously (i.v.), we quantified the number of transferred cells remaining in the blood to assess emigration of cells across the whole organism. To additionally investigate the influence of a rhythmic microenvironment in this process, we harvested donor cells at one time and transferred them simultaneously into recipients that were kept in shifted light cycles. We saw a clear diurnal rhythm given that the number of labeled donor cells remaining in the blood after transfer was lowest in an evening environment (ZT13) and highest in the morning (ZT1) for all investigated subsets (Figure 1 B and Figure S1 B). This demonstrated that in the evening more cells had left the blood, for example, by migrating into tissues or by firm contact with the vasculature, both of which effectively removed them from the circulation. Furthermore, it demonstrated a strong influence of rhythmicity in the microenvironment on leukocyte recruitment and numbers in blood in general. We next assessed the role of rhythmicity in leukocytes in this process. This time, donor cells were harvested from mice kept in shifted light cycles and simultaneously injected into recipient mice at one time of the day. In this scenario as well, "evening" cells showed the highest emigration behavior, and "morning" cells generally showed the lowest (Figure 1 C). We confirmed these observations by performing reciprocal emigration assays where "morning" or "evening" cells were co-injected into "morning" or "evening" recipients, respectively, with differential color labeling (Figure S1 C). These data thus demonstrated that both microenvironment and leukocytes co-contribute to rhythmic leukocyte exit from the circulation, a broad phenomenon that peaks in the evening for all subsets investigated.

### Plasma myeloperoxidase-conjugated DNA level predicts outcomes and organ dysfunction in patients with septic shock [^115Tj4wd]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Patients

The present study was a secondary analysis of a previous prospective observational multicenter cohort study that investigated the incidence and prognosis of septic shock in Japan (Japan Sepsis Study). That study was conducted from April 2008 to March 2010, enrolling patients admitted to the ICUs of 35 Japanese hospitals, among whom 31 patients were eligible for the present study. In addition, collection of medical data and blood samples was continued at the ICU of Aichi Medical University Hospital according to the same study design from April 2011 to July 2017, proving another 24 patients for this study (55 in total). The ethics committee at each hospital approved the protocol of this study, and informed consent was obtained from each patient or from a relative or legal representative if direct consent could not be obtained.

Fifty-five patients with septic shock aged between 36 and 91 years were enrolled who met both of the following criteria: 1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection (according to the consensus definition of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference Committee); and 2) hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 40 mmHg from baseline) persisting for at least 1 h despite adequate fluid infusion and requiring pressor agents to maintain a systolic blood pressure around 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg, associated with hypoperfusion (including lactic acidosis, oliguria, and/or acute changes of mental state). SIRS was diagnosed if patients had at least two of the following clinical features: temperature < 36 °C or > 38 °C; heart rate > 90/min; respiration rate > 20/min or arterial PCO₂ < 32 mmHg; and white blood cell count > 12,000/mm³ or < 4000/mm³, or left shift of the differential white blood cell count with band forms ≥ 10%. The exclusion criteria were terminal cancer, terminal hematological illness, severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin ≥ 10 mg/dl and hepaplastin test ≤ 40%), and refusal to provide written consent. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed based on the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC diagnosis criteria. All patients were managed according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign protocol 2008, including fluid resuscitation, use of vasopressors, transfusion, and timely initiation of antibiotic therapy. The following data were obtained from an established registry database: demographic information, site of infection, results of culture and laboratory tests, hemodynamic variables, and therapeutic interventions. All patients were followed up for 28 days after enrollment to assess the 28-day mortality rate. To evaluate organ dysfunction and the severity of sepsis, the SOFA score and the APACHE II score were determined. The control subjects were 13 healthy age-matched volunteers with no significant acute or chronic illnesses.

### Rare case of-related splenic abscess [^116xJQP8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Investigations

Laboratory data from emergency department revealed leucocytosis of 17 200×10³/μL with left shift. Posterioanterior chest X-ray on admission revealed mild to moderate left-sided pleural effusion. Initial cardiac workup was negative, including ECG, serum troponin and a transthoracic echocardiogram with a normal ejection fraction and wall movement. The negative cardiac workup and continued nausea and vomiting along with left upper abdominal pain the next day prompted an abdominal and pelvic CT scan without contrast which revealed an 8.9 cm hypodensity in the superior aspect of the spleen with ill-defined linear densities in the inferior and anterior aspect without surrounding fluid (figures 1 and 2). The infectious disease consultant recommended interventional radiology-guided aspiration of the hypodense splenic territory. Aspirated material was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. General Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient underwent a diagnostic exploratory laparotomy. Cultures from interventional radiology (IR)-guided aspirate and splenectomy specimen were identified as P. acnes on a micro scan. No special tests were done to identify the subtype of P. acnes. Five sets of blood cultures ordered during hospital course were all negative. Transoesophageal echocardiogram done in view of the patient's history of intravenous and subcutaneous drug abuse was negative for valvular vegetations. Pathology reports from the splenectomy revealed a specimen weighing approximately 460 g with admixed fibropurulent exudate with some congestion and haemorrhage, consistent with abscess tissue along with some surrounding fibrosis (figure 3). It measured approximately 18×15.5×7.5 cm. She also underwent left-sided thoracentesis for worsening pleural effusion attributed to her splenic abscess. The fluid was negative on stain and culture. Fluid analysis revealed the pleural effusion to be an exudate. Repeat chest X-ray showed resolution of the pleural effusion.

### Clinical outcomes of ED patients with bandemia [^114vnWax]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although an elevated white blood cell count is a widely utilized measure for evidence of infection and an important criterion for evaluation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, its component band count occupies a more contested position within clinical emergency medicine. Recent studies indicate that bandemia is highly predictive of a serious infection, suggesting that clinicians who do not appreciate the value of band counts may delay diagnosis or overlook severe infections.

Objectives

Whereas previous studies focused on determining the quantitative value of the band count (ie, determining sensitivity, threshold for bandemia, etc.), this study directs attention to patient-centered outcomes, hypothesizing that the degree of bandemia predisposes patients to subsequent negative clinical outcomes associated with underappreciated severe infections.

Methods

This retrospective study of electronic medical records includes patients who initially presented to the emergency department (ED) with bandemia and were subsequently discharged from the ED. These patients were screened for repeat ED visits within 7 days and death within 30 days.

Results

In patients with severe bandemia who were discharged from the ED, there was a 20.9% revisit rate at 7 days and a 4.9% mortality rate at 30 days, placing severely bandemic patients at 5 times significantly greater mortality compared to nonbandemic patients (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

Our review of patient outcomes suggests that the degree of bandemia, especially in the setting of concurrent tachycardia or fever, is associated with greater likelihood of negative clinical outcomes.

COVID-19 inflammatory markers — interpretation for bacterial or fungal coinfection. Elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 may reflect immune dysregulation and have been incorrectly interpreted as indicating bacterial coinfection; COVID-19 without bacterial or fungal infection causes elevations in white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin frequently reflects severe COVID-19 rather than bacterial coinfection, contributing to antibiotic overuse when these laboratory abnormalities are used to initiate or continue antibiotics.

Postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) safety — perforation, infection, and bleeding: Postplacental IUD insertion has risks similar to insertion at other time points, with perforation rare in a prospective study of 8343 women that documented only one perforation after 460 postplacental insertions (0.2%), a risk not greater than insertion more than 6 months postpartum. Risk of infection after postplacental insertion is low, including no difference in clinical endometritis at 10 days postpartum between acceptors and non-acceptors (3% vs. 5%) and identical leukocyte left-shift rates (16% in both groups). Vaginal bleeding does not appear to be increased; in 191 cesarean deliveries, mean bleeding duration was 27 days vs. 33 days vs. 20 days for control, Nova-T, and LNG-IUD groups, respectively, with no difference in postpartum day 1 hemoglobin (11.2 g/dL vs. 11.1 g/dL), the control group had higher puerperal sepsis (8% vs. 1%), and another trial reported no difference in hemoglobin at 10 days postpartum (11.9 g/dL in both groups).

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^111314sy]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our much larger sample allowed us to examine the interaction between timing and dose effect, which other studies have not considered. This is important because we found large differences by dose and days since steroid initiation. Proper interpretation requires consideration of both factors. Furthermore, the study of a specifically noninfected cohort allows us to define an expected range of WBC response to steroids not related to infection or malignancy.

Our findings should have practical import for clinicians working in hospital medicine. Elevated WBCs are common in the hospital, as are conditions that require treatment with steroids. Whether to initiate a work‐up for the leukocytosis depends on the clinician's judgment, but an important consideration is the expected rise in WBCs following steroid initiation. The dosages we studied are typical of those given in routine hospital care, and our large sample allowed us to estimate changes over time at different dosages. For example, patients with COPD are often treated with 60 mg of prednisone daily. In that case, a subsequent rise in WBC should not be attributed to steroids. In contrast, if a patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg three times daily, the WBC would be expected to rise 4–5 points by 48 h. However, no rise would be expected in the first 24 h. Nor should there be a new spike after 3 or 4 days. Such unexpected rises, either by timing or magnitude, should raise suspicion of a pathological process. Physicians may use clinical factors to further investigate leukocytosis and potential infection including vital sign abnormalities or biomarkers of infection or inflammation such as procalcitonin, C‐reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Our study has several limitations. It is from a single health system and may not be generalizable. We did not include infected patients, who may have different responses to steroids. We reported mean increases, but individuals likely have varied responses. We were unable to discern the exact indication for steroid use in our patients due to the nature of the data; however, we tried to assess this by proxy of their comorbidities and control for chronic steroid use by excluding patients with recent outpatient steroid prescription fills. Additionally, we found similar trends in WBC in patients with and without COPD.

### BCR-ABL testing by polymerase chain reaction in patients with neutrophilia: the william beaumont hospital experience and the case for rational laboratory test requests | JCO oncology practice… [^114wpP2L]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

We concluded that the presence of concurrent neutrophilia and basophilia has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% in the initial diagnosis of CML. Our results suggest that the presence of both neutrophilia and basophilia should be used as a threshold for the placement of orders for BCR-ABLin the initial diagnosis of CML in patients with leukocytosis with left shift and provide a basis for a reduction in health care spending. In view of the almost universal request for BCR-ABLby PCR by the physicians in our hospital in the evaluation of noninfectious patients presenting with leukocytosis with left shift, we proposed to investigate whether the presence of concurrent neutrophilia with basophilia is sufficient as a threshold for the request for BCR-ABLby PCR testing in the initial diagnosis of CML.

Discussion This is a single-institution study that attempted to define the minimum requirements for the placement of orders for one of the most common molecular tests received at our clinical pathology laboratory for patients who present with leukocytosis with left shift. We also analyzed the financial implication of indiscriminate ordering of the test. Our results confirm an earlier report that showed the almost universal presence of basophilia in patients with a diagnosis of CML confirmed by a demonstration of positive. BCR-ABLby PCR. 1, 4, 9 Findings from our study also showed that the presence of concurrent neutrophilia and basophilia seems to be an important hematologic feature to consider in the initial diagnosis of CML both in inpatient and outpatient evaluation of patients presenting with leukocytosis with a left shift. The presence of both hematologic parameters showed a high sensitivity and specificity for a positive.

In conclusion, the presence of concurrent neutrophilia and basophilia should be a minimum requirement for placing orders for a BCR-ABLtest in the initial diagnosis of CML in patients with leukocytosis with left shift; this will help prevent excessive and indiscriminate testing and help reduce health care costs. More education regarding the biology of CML and indications for the BCR-ABLtest among practicing hematologists, oncologists, fellows, and residents in training, irrespective of their practice location, should be emphasized and is highly recommended.

### Pregabalin-induced urticarial rash and neutropenia in a renal transplant recipient: a case report [^113DsYmq]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Preliminary results showed a white cell count of 2.4, with neutrophils at 1.08 (45%) [Table 1]. He was therefore started on amoxicillin and gentamicin after discussion with the microbiology team, given the chronic immunosuppressive treatment, the presence of lethargy and a moderately raised CRP. Antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 2 days following a negative blood culture.

Table 1
White cell count before pregabalin initiation, at day 1 post-admission (pregabalin was discontinued on admission), and up to day 9 post-admission

The pregabalin was stopped on admission, and the neutrophil count continued to drop over the next day, but slowly began to recover over the subsequent few days. Azathioprine treatment was continued at the same dosage throughout the admission.

A subsequent blood film (Figs. 1 and 2) confirmed severe neutropenia and revealed some reactive lymphocytes and neutrophil left shift, which was interpreted by the haematologists as likely drug reaction. Immunological results showed normal C3 (1.07, reference range 0.75–1.65) and C4 (0.21, reference range 0.14–0.54), and normal IgG, IgM, and IgA. CMV and BK viral loads, and serology for syphilis, Borrelia, Hepatitis B and C, and HIV were all negative. EBV serology was negative. Cytoplasmic speckling was seen on Hep-2 cells, but the extractable nuclear antigen screen (ENA) antibodies that followed were negative. An ultrasound of the transplanted kidney was normal. Renal function remained stable during the hospital stay. The patient continued to be monitored on the ward and after 9 days as an inpatient, his white cell count became normal.

### Immature granulocyte fraction in the peripheral blood is a practical indicator for mobilization of CD34 (+) cells [^112qE4uf]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

We propose a simple parameter that improves prediction of the number of CD34(+) cells in blood cells collected by apheresis for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation following administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The percentage of immature granulocytes including myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes (LSI for left-shift index) immediately prior to the start of each apheresis correlated with the number of CD34(+) cells in PBSC collections (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001, Y = 0.227X − 0.99, R² = 0.623) much better than did the white blood cell count (r = 0.07), currently the most commonly used predictor in deciding the initiation of apheresis. We then used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine a cutoff point for LSI to prevent unnecessary apheresis. At LSI > 7.5, sensitivity and specificity of cutoff points in the probability of obtaining > 1.0 × 10⁶ CD34(+) cells/kg BW were 93.3% and 94.3% (95% CI, 91.4–100.0%), respectively. When LSI reaches 15.25, nearly 100% of apheresis will attain the target CD34(+) cell dose. These findings indicate that LSI is a useful and simple method for predicting the yield of CD34(+) cells before the start of PBSC collection and avoiding unnecessary apheresis.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): focus on peripheral blood cell morphology [^116znzzg]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have shown peculiar morphological anomalies in COVID-19 patients' smears. We searched all the peer-reviewed scientific publications that explicitly reference the cytomorphological alterations on peripheral blood smears of patients with COVID-19. We extracted data from sixty-five publications (case reports, patient group studies, reviews, and erythrocyte morphology studies). The results show that frequent alterations concern the morphology of lymphocytes (large lymphocytes with weakly basophilic cytoplasm, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, large granular lymphocytes). Neutrophils display abnormal nuclei and cytoplasm in a distinctive cytomorphological picture. Besides a left shift in maturation, granulations can be increased (toxic type) or decreased with areas of basophilia. Nuclei are often hyposegmented (pseudo-Pelger-Huёt anomaly). Apoptotic or pycnotic cells are not uncommon. Monocytes typically have a large cytoplasm loaded with heterogeneous and coalescing vacuoles. Platelets show large and giant shapes. The presence of erythrocyte fragments and schistocytes is especially evident in the forms of COVID-19 that are associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Such atypia of blood cells reflects the generalized activation in severe COVID-19, which has been demonstrated with immunophenotypic, molecular, genetic, and functional methods. Neutrophils, in particular, are involved in the pathophysiology of hyperinflammation with cytokine storm, which characterizes the most unfavorable evolution.

### Human acute inflammatory recovery is defined by co-regulatory dynamics of white blood cell and platelet populations [^115m7hes]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

This variable transformation (Fig. 2c) makes clear that WBC-PLT dynamics during recovery from all of these inflammatory states is well-characterized as exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT growth:

For all patients with sufficient data across all inflammatory cohorts, this model fit individual patient WBC-PLT trajectories with a median adjusted R² of 0.84 for WBC and 0.92 for PLT (Fig. 2d). Figure 3 shows that typical recovering patients tend to follow this recovery shape, regardless of age or condition, with additional individual patient trajectories provided in Supplementary Figs. 9–10.

Fig. 3
Most individual recovering patients follow the same WBC-PLT recovery shape, independent of inflammatory stimulus.

a Across all 12 cohorts, individual patient WBC recovery dynamics are well-approximated by the model with median adjusted R² = 0.85, as are individual PLT recovery dynamics (b) with a median adjusted R² of 0.95 following a variable delay. c WBC-PLT dynamics for representative patients follow the model. Representative patients are those with each inflammatory condition whose WBC-PLT data had model fits closest to the cohort median adjusted R². These patients exhibit exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT increase during recovery despite significant differences in gender and age (bottom left of each panel), inflammatory stimulus, CBC frequency, and magnitude of WBC and PLT count changes. See Supplementary Figs. 9–10 for additional representative WBC-PLT dynamics for patients whose raw WBC-PLT data had model fits near the 25th and 75th percentiles of the cohort adjusted R² distributions. Thin black lines in panels (a), (b) are shown for 500 patients randomly selected from the adjusted R² distributions. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^1164RvGb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

It is widely accepted that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Clinicians must decide whether a rise in white blood cell (WBC) count is due to steroids versus other processes like developing infection.

Objective

The objective of this study is to measure the increase in white blood cell count after corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients without malignancy, infection, or immune dysfunction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2018 in a single large healthcare system. We analyzed the trajectory of WBC count stratified by steroid dose. The study included nonsurgical patients admitted with at least two complete blood count measurements. Patients were excluded if they had immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, or steroid use within 2 weeks before admission. The main outcome was mean WBC count by day following corticosteroid administration.

Results

Our sample included 28,425 patients with at least two WBC measurements, 1608 (5.7%) of which received steroids. WBC response peaked at 48 h after steroid administration with a mean increase of 2.4 × 10⁹/L WBCs. In all patients on steroids, across doses, the mean increase was 0.3 × 10⁹/L WBCs, 1.7 × 10⁹/L WBCs, and 4.84 × 10⁹/L WBCs in low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. For patients not on steroids, the mean WBC count decreased during hospitalization.

Conclusions

When interpreting WBC counts after initiating steroids, increases of up to 4.84 × 10⁹/L cells may be seen within 48 h after high‐dose steroids. Larger increases, and any increase after low‐dose steroids, suggest other causes of leukocytosis.

Bone marrow morphology

Bone marrow is uniformly and intensely hypercellular in CNL due to expanded neutrophilic granulopoiesis with an increased myeloid to erythroid ratio which may be in excess of 20:1. However, the left shift is distinctly more subtle and mature neutrophils more prominent than in CML with the majority of granulocyte precursors being at the metamyelocyte to segmented stages of maturation. Fewer than 5% myeloblasts are present and there is an absence of Auer rods as well as no dysplastic features. Reticulin staining, though characteristically normal, may show minimal fibrosis but should not exceed a grade of 1+. Erythroid maturation is normoblastic and megakaryocytes, while morphologically normal, may be normal or slightly increased in number.

C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: Plasma CRP levels start to rise 12 — 24 hours after an acute inflammatory or infectious insult, reaching a maximum value after 48 hours. Levels of CRP are typically below 5 mg/L and the typical cutoff for CRP is 10 mg/L. Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^115GhNSG]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Complete blood count indices and their ratios are associated with adverse clinical outcomes for many acute illnesses, but the mechanisms generating these associations are not fully understood. Recent identification of a consistent pattern of white blood cell and platelet count co-regulation during acute inflammatory recovery provides a potentially unifying explanation. Here we show that the platelet-to-white-cell ratio, which was selected based on this conserved recovery pattern, is more strongly associated with mortality than other blood count markers and ratios in four important illnesses involving acute inflammation: COVID-19, acute heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Patients recovering well from these acute illnesses tend to follow a joint white cell and platelet trajectory that can be reduced to this one-dimensional ratio. The platelet-to-white-cell ratio's association with prognosis is consistent with recently identified inflammatory dynamics and may provide a convenient and interpretable summary of patient inflammatory state.

Association of shiftwork and immune cells among police officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress study 2017 By Wirth, Michael D.; Andrew, Michael E.; Burchfiel, Cecil M. ;. Source: Chronobiol Int. 34: 721–731 English. Details: Alternative Title: Chronobiol Int Personal Author: Description: Shift workers suffer from a constellation of symptoms associated with disruption of circadian rhythms including sleep abnormalities, and abnormal hormone secretion. Recent, but limited, evidence suggests that shift workers have elevated levels of circulating white blood cells compared to their day working counterparts. Interestingly, recent reviews highlight the strong linkage between the immune system and circadian rhythms which includes, but is not limited to, circulating cell populations and functions. The elevated levels of these WBCs may be associated with the increased chronic disease risk observed among this group.

The purpose of this analysis was to examine the cross-sectional association between long- and short-term shiftwork and counts of WBCs among officers in the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress cohort. Data collection for this analysis took place among 464 police officers working in Buffalo, New York, USA between 2004 and 2009. Precise SW histories were obtained using electronic payroll records. Officers were assigned a shift type based on the shift that they spent a majority of their time from 1994 to the data collection date for long-term SW. Compared to the day shift group, those working long-term night shifts had greater absolute numbers of total WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Those working mainly on the night shift over 7-days had elevated counts of WBCs, lymphocytes, and monocytes compared to those mainly working day shifts.

These findings, plus previous findings, may provide evidence that SW may lead to immune system dysregulation. Future research is needed to understand whether increases in immune cells among shift workers may be associated with the increased disease risk among this group.

### Platelet-white cell ratio is more strongly associated with mortality than other common risk ratios derived from complete blood counts [^1166TD7J]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Complete blood count (CBC) indices and their ratios, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), are widely reported to have significant associations with adverse clinical outcomes in many acutely ill cohorts –. These markers have been studied in diverse clinical settings for their potential to inform diagnosis and prognosis –, assist with triage, and guide treatment decisions. The pathophysiologic mechanisms generating these associations in diverse disease settings are not fully understood, and this mechanistic uncertainty may contribute to reduced clinical utilization of these markers. Recent work has identified co-regulation of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) populations as a feature of healthy inflammatory recoverythat is preserved across heterogeneous pathologic processes including different types of trauma, ischemia, and infection. Favorable inflammatory recoveries are defined by exponential WBC decrease followed by linear PLT increase. This finding provides a potential unifying mechanism for CBC ratio associations with mortality across the diversity of acute inflammatory disease settings.

If a universal WBC-PLT inflammatory recovery trajectory helps generate the widely observed associations between CBC index ratios and clinical outcomes, then a ratio specifically designed with this trajectory in mind, PLT/WBC (PWR), should reliably increase during successful inflammatory recoveries and be at least as strongly associated with clinical outcomes as other ratios that do not as directly reflect these WBC-PLT recovery dynamics. Thus, we hypothesized that PWR would provide significant risk stratification in inflammatory settings by reducing the WBC-PLT trajectory to one dimension, with low PWR reflecting failure of PLT recovery, or persistent WBC elevation, or both. However, PWR has not been studied systematically in contrast to NLR, PLR, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and other CBC-derived statistics.

Here, we show that PWR provides stronger stratification of mortality risk than other CBC markers and ratios in the setting of four different diseases involving acute inflammation: COVID-19, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We validate these findings in a cohort from an independent medical center. Our results are consistent with recently identified inflammatory dynamicsand suggest that PWR may provide a convenient and interpretable summary of patient inflammatory state.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) laboratory findings — The total white blood cell count is typically normal or slightly increased in patients with RMSF, with increased numbers of immature neutrophils. Thrombocytopenia, slight elevations in hepatic transaminases (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), and hyponatremia might be present, particularly as the disease advances; however, laboratory values cannot be relied on to guide early treatment decisions because they are often within or slightly deviated from the reference range early in the course of illness. Indicators of diffuse tissue injury, such as elevated levels of creatine kinase or serum lactate dehydrogenase, might be present later in the course.

### Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: a zebra worth knowing [^115nzJQy]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe cardiopulmonary illness most often caused by the Sin Nombre virus, which is transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized particles of rodent excreta or direct rodent contact. Although HPS is more common in the western United States, cases have been identified in 31 states. The illness begins as a nonspecific febrile prodrome, sharing many of its initial symptoms with other more common viral infections. Patients then quickly develop noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and shock. Characteristic laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, a left-shifted leukocytosis, hemoconcentration, and presence of immunoblasts. The overall case fatality rate of HPS is approximately 40 percent. Diagnosis is confirmed by serologic identification of IgM and IgG antibodies to Sin Nombre virus. There is no specific therapy, but early recognition of HPS during the prodromal phase can expedite initiating cardiopulmonary support in an intensive care unit, which is associated with improved survival rates. Prevention of HPS involves avoiding contact with rodents and rodent habitats.

### Routine hematologic clinical tests as prognostic markers in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^115stWHd]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Prognostic markers are needed to identify patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are at high risk for adverse events. Although the search for new biomarkers is quite active, prognostic information is available from routine hematologic tests, such as the complete blood count. For example, elevated white blood cell counts during ACS are associated with increased risk of mortality, heart failure, shock, and left ventricular dysfunction. Anemia is associated with increased risk of mortality, whereas elevated platelet counts predict poorer clinical and angiographic outcomes. In this review, we summarize the literature regarding the use of clinical hematology tests including white blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, and platelet count as prognostic markers in patients with ACS, and we describe potential mechanisms to explain these associations.

Data collection

Data was accessed on 01.07.2024, the authors had access to information that could identify individual participants during data collection. The local ethical committee waived the need for consent. Data collection included age, sex, admission diagnosis, positive sputum culture, radiological evidence of pneumonia, length of stay in the NICU, intubation status and mechanical ventilation, creatinine values, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission, and whether the patient had recently undergone surgery (< 10 days). Clinical and laboratory data relevant to the diagnosis of HAP were recorded, including presence of leukocytosis, defined as a leukocyte count above 9.8 × 10³/µL for males and 10.4 × 10³/µL for females, based on institutional laboratory standards. Confirmation of pneumonia diagnosis was based on clinical signs (fever, yellow phlegm production, increasing supplemental oxygen, crepitations during auscultation) and Laboratory results (leukocytosis, neutrophil left shift), which resulted in the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Although CRP values were available in a small number of patients (n = 31), they were not routinely collected in our NICU and thus not included in the multivariate analysis due to high false-positive rates in the neurosurgical patient-population.

### The development of marked elevation in white blood cell count does not predict inferior outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112AU33K]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Although elevation of the white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) appears to predict shortened survival, its significance later in the course of the disease remains unclear. We reviewed all cases of CLL seen in our center between 1980 and 1999 to evaluate the frequency and clinical significance of WBC elevation > 100 × 10⁹/L. CLL was confirmed according to standard diagnostic criteria and data was collected from diagnosis, occurrence of WBC > 100 x 10(9)/L, and last follow-up. 235 consecutive patients with CLL were identified; 94 were excluded. 141 included patients had a median age of 61 years and median WBC 19.7 × 10⁹/L at diagnosis. Median follow-up for all patients was 56 months, and median survival was 104 months. 41 patients (29%) had ≥ 1 episode of WBC > 100 x 10(9)1/L, occurring at a median of 38 months from diagnosis. Compared to controls matched for modified Rai stage, development of a WBC > 100 x 10(9)/L did not predict inferior survival (median 107 vs. 101 months, p = 0.72). We conclude that the occurrence of a WBC count > 100 x 10(9)/L in patients with CLL does not shorten the survival, and patients require therapy only if other indications for treatment are present.

An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement [^114FhzKt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Sepsis definitions and biomarkers — diagnostic criteria evolution and key markers are outlined as follows: A 1992 consensus defined sepsis as infection concern plus ≥ 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, specifically "temperature > 38° C or < 36° C; heart rate > 90 beats/min; respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or PaCO₂ < 32 mm Hg; white blood cell count > 12,000/μL, < 4,000/μL, or > 10% immature bands", a definition "extremely broad" since "up to 50% of hospitalized patients met these criteria". In 2016, "Sepsis 3" was proposed as "a suspected infection and a change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of at least 2", with in-hospital mortality "greater than 10%". Plasma lactate is emphasized: "septic shock is clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L", and "even a modest elevation of lactate (2.1–4.0 mmol/L) has been associated with increased risk of death", with measurement of "6-hour lactate clearance" included in the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines and CMS SEP-1. Broader biomarker surveys report "178 candidate biomarkers in 3,370 references". Procalcitonin shows "modest" diagnostic performance with "sensitivity and specificity of 71% to 81%", limiting diagnostic utility, though serial procalcitonin algorithms "have been shown to be useful for avoiding prolonged courses of antibiotics".
