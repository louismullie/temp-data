## Question

For a septic patient with suspected myocardial depression, is there any role for levosimendan based on LeoPARDS, and how would you counsel on expected benefits and risks?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether levosimendan has any role in septic shock with suspected myocardial depression, what the LeoPARDS trial actually showed, and how to counsel on expected benefits and risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence from LeoPARDS. Then, I should verify guideline positions and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine subgroup data and mechanistic considerations. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks, including hemodynamic and safety profiles. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and counseling points, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the original sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the pivotal evidence. Septic shock with myocardial depression is common and carries high mortality; inotropes are reserved for patients with low cardiac output and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume and blood pressure, not for isolated contractile impairment without low output, so I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing indications to all septic patients with depressed function [^f0e228ad]. The LeoPARDS randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 516 adults with sepsis on vasopressors found no reduction in mean SOFA score, no mortality benefit, fewer ventilator-free days, and more supraventricular tachyarrhythmias with levosimendan, which is the highest-quality evidence in this population and should anchor decisions [^025fc4d8] [^90aa2926].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction of key outcomes so I don't misstate them. The 28-day mortality was 34.5% with levosimendan versus 30.9% with placebo, an absolute difference of 3.6 percentage points favoring placebo, and supraventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred in 3.1% with levosimendan versus 0.4% with placebo, confirming a signal of harm without offsetting benefit in the primary endpoint [^025fc4d8] [^90aa2926]. I should also note that patients assigned to levosimendan required more norepinephrine and were less likely to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation, reinforcing the lack of clinical benefit and potential harm in this context [^025fc4d8] [^397b6a0c].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to ensure consistency. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 issues a weak recommendation against levosimendan in adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion, citing no mortality benefit and signals of harm including more supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and less successful weaning from ventilation, aligning with LeoPARDS and a meta-analysis of three RCTs showing no mortality effect versus no inotrope [^30471342] [^9fd45ff6] [^25dd8942]. Hold on, I should verify the comparator claims: the SSC also notes no superiority of levosimendan over dobutamine in pooled analyses, which supports choosing dobutamine or epinephrine when inotropy is truly indicated rather than levosimendan [^30471342] [^9fd45ff6].

> I will now examine subgroup data to see if any enriched population changed the calculus. A biomarker-stratified subgroup analysis of LeoPARDS using troponin I and NT-proBNP found no benefit from levosimendan even in patients with biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction; in fact, those with NT-proBNP above the median who received levosimendan had higher SOFA scores, so biomarker enrichment did not identify a responsive subgroup in that dataset [^c99f0e6b]. Let me reconsider whether refractory shock was adequately represented; only about 10% of enrolled patients had a low cardiac output state, which limits extrapolation to refractory phenotypes, but the trial's pre-specified analyses still failed to show benefit where it was hypothesized [^397b6a0c].

> But wait, what if mechanistic advantages change the risk-benefit balance in sepsis? Levosimendan's calcium-sensitizing inotropy without raising intracellular calcium and its vasodilatory effects could theoretically improve microcirculation, and small studies suggest microvascular benefits and improved regional perfusion, yet these physiologic gains did not translate into improved organ dysfunction or survival in LeoPARDS, and the long half-life of the active metabolite complicates titration and reversal in unstable patients [^07474ee2] [^6c1a88a8] [^75b94d3d]. I should double-check the practical implication: the prolonged effect means adverse hemodynamics can persist for days, which is problematic in septic shock where myocardial depression often resolves within 48–72 hours and ongoing inotropy may be unnecessary or harmful [^1248ba15].

> I need to ensure the risk profile is explicit. Beyond supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, levosimendan is associated with hypotension and may increase vasopressor requirements, and in septic shock — where vasoplegia is prominent — this can worsen perfusion if not carefully managed; the SSC highlights these safety concerns alongside the lack of benefit, reinforcing caution even when myocardial depression is suspected [^30471342] [^9fd45ff6]. Hold on, I should verify that these safety signals were consistent across sensitivity analyses; yes, the arrhythmia signal and need for more norepinephrine were reproducible in LeoPARDS and echoed in subsequent summaries [^025fc4d8] [^397b6a0c].

> Let me translate this into a practical, guideline-concordant approach. First, confirm true low cardiac output with inadequate tissue perfusion using bedside assessment, lactate trends, and echocardiography rather than relying on ejection fraction alone, because some septic patients have depressed function with preserved or high output and should not receive inotropes [^f0e228ad]. If inotropy is indicated, add dobutamine to norepinephrine or use epinephrine alone, and avoid levosimendan given the lack of benefit and potential harm; if dobutamine is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider alternatives case-by-case, but recognize that evidence for non-catecholamine inotropes in sepsis is limited and inconsistent [^6a21af05] [^7ddd43c4] [^30471342]. I should confirm that we also plan de-escalation: inotropes should be weaned promptly if there is no improvement in perfusion or if adverse effects emerge, consistent with SSC guidance [^7ddd43c4].

> For counseling, I would explain that based on the best available randomized evidence, levosimendan does not improve survival, does not reduce organ dysfunction, may prolong mechanical ventilation, and increases the risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, while also potentially requiring more vasopressor support; therefore, it is not recommended for septic shock with myocardial depression and standard agents like dobutamine or epinephrine should be used when inotropy is truly indicated [^025fc4d8] [^30471342] [^9fd45ff6]. I should also note that although small studies suggest microcirculatory improvements, these have not translated into patient-centered benefits in large, high-quality trials, so routine use is not justified outside of research settings [^6c1a88a8] [^75b94d3d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-aligned: there is no role for routine levosimendan use in septic shock with suspected myocardial depression based on LeoPARDS and contemporary guidelines; reserve inotropes for documented low output with persistent hypoperfusion, prefer dobutamine or epinephrine, and avoid levosimendan given lack of benefit and signals of harm, with any exceptional use limited to carefully selected scenarios with close monitoring and a plan for rapid de-escalation [^025fc4d8] [^30471342] [^6a21af05].

Levosimendan is **not recommended** for septic patients with suspected myocardial depression based on LeoPARDS, which showed **no improvement in organ dysfunction or mortality** and a **higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias** compared to placebo [^025fc4d8] [^90aa2926]. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 issues a **weak recommendation against levosimendan** in this setting, favoring dobutamine or epinephrine when inotropes are indicated [^30471342] [^6a21af05]. If considered at all, levosimendan should be restricted to refractory cases with confirmed low cardiac output and ongoing hypoperfusion despite optimized therapy, with close monitoring for hypotension and arrhythmias [^6c4b66fd].

## Summary of the LeoPARDS trial

- **Design**: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
- **Population**: 516 adults with sepsis requiring vasopressors for ≥ 4 hours.
- **Intervention**: Levosimendan 0.05–0.2 mcg/kg/min for 24 hours plus standard care vs placebo.
- **Primary outcome**: Mean SOFA score over ICU stay (no difference: 6.68 vs 6.06; mean difference 0.61, 95% CI −0.07 to 1.29).

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

- **SSC 2021**: Weak recommendation against levosimendan in septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion; suggests dobutamine or epinephrine if inotropes are needed [^30471342] [^6a21af05].
- **Rationale**: No mortality or organ dysfunction benefit, more arrhythmias, and potential hypotension requiring more vasopressor support [^30471342] [^9fd45ff6].

## Potential benefits and risks

| **Potential benefits** | **Potential risks** |
|-|-|
| Improved cardiac output and microcirculation in small studies [^2124eb19] [^6c1a88a8] | Increased supraventricular tachyarrhythmias [^025fc4d8] [^90aa2926] |
| Non-catecholamine mechanism may help in beta-blocker toxicity or catecholamine-resistant shock [^1f40d862] [^a4ed6da2] | Hypotension and higher vasopressor requirements [^025fc4d8] [^397b6a0c] |
| Possible renal benefits in cardiac surgery (not confirmed in sepsis) [^7e7f95ad] [^57c93dcd] | Prolonged half-life complicates rapid reversal if adverse effects occur [^07474ee2] [^1248ba15] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where levosimendan may be considered

If considered, levosimendan may be used in **refractory septic shock** with confirmed low cardiac output and ongoing hypoperfusion despite optimized fluids, vasopressors, and dobutamine, and in **beta-blocker toxicity** where catecholamines are ineffective. Use should be exceptional, with close hemodynamic and rhythm monitoring.

---

## Practical counseling points

- **Evidence**: LeoPARDS showed no organ dysfunction or mortality benefit and more arrhythmias with levosimendan [^025fc4d8] [^90aa2926].
- **Guidelines**: Weak recommendation against use; prefer dobutamine or epinephrine if inotropes are indicated [^30471342] [^6a21af05].
- **Risks**: Higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and hypotension requiring more vasopressor support [^025fc4d8] [^397b6a0c].
- **Monitoring**: If used, monitor closely for hypotension, arrhythmias, and clinical response; be prepared to stop infusion and adjust vasopressors [^025fc4d8] [^e149caf3].

---

Levosimendan is **not recommended** for septic patients with suspected myocardial depression based on LeoPARDS, which showed no benefit and more arrhythmias. Reserve it for exceptional refractory cases with confirmed low output and ongoing hypoperfusion despite optimized therapy, and monitor closely for adverse effects.

Personalized use of inotropic agents

There are no data to support the systematic use of inotropic agents. The indiscriminate use of levosimendan in such patients was unsuccessful. Even attempting to identify patients with myocardial injury based on biomarkers was not helpful. This is not surprising since the consequences of sepsis-associated myocardial depression are highly variable. Some patients present with a high CO or even dynamic obstruction of the outflow tract despite significant impairment in cardiac function or high levels of biomarkers. They should not be treated with inotropic agents. On the other hand, some patients present with a low CO related to left or right ventricular dysfunction and may benefit from inotropic agents. Accordingly, as stated above, inotropes may be indicated only in patients with signs of tissue hypoperfusion related to a low CO induced by impaired cardiac function. Adverse effects (tachycardia, arrhythmias) and specific risks in some patient categories (hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, myocardial ischemia) should be cautiously scrutinized, and risks/benefits of the intervention evaluated.

Discussion on the type of agent is more complex. No agent has proven to be superior to another in patients in shock. Of note, most trials comparing inotropic agents were performed in patients with heart failure and excluded patients in cardiogenic shock. Accordingly, meta-analyses of these trials should be considered cautiously.

Based on pharmacologic properties, we suggest the following stepwise approach: First, test a limited dose of dobutamine (2.5 to 5 mcg/kg/min) and evaluate efficacy and tolerance. In cases of severe contractility impairment, higher doses (up to 20 mcg/kg/min) may be considered. Second, substitute or add enoximone or milrinone and evaluate efficacy and tolerance (beware of the risk of hypotension). Third, substitute or add levosimendan in cases of severe impairment. At each step, efficacy (improvement in cardiac function and CO, resolution of tissue hypoperfusion) and tolerance (e.g. lack of tachycardia, arrhythmias, etc.) should be evaluated. For each of the agents, the lowest dose associated with the desired effect should be administered. As soon as the situation improves, weaning of inotropes should be attempted.

The study LeoPARDS was published by Anthony C Gordon and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the LeoPARDS study, the trial question was: what is the role of levosimendan in patients with sepsis? In the LeoPARDS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the LeoPARDS study, the population was: 515 patients (226 female, 289 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis who had received vasopressors for at least 4 hours. The key exclusion criteria were ESRD; severe chronic hepatic impairment; previous treatment with levosimendan within 30 days; history of torsades de pointes; hypersensitivity to levosimendan. In the LeoPARDS study, the interventions were: n=258 levosimendan (at a dose of 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/minute for 24 hours plus standard care) n=257 placebo (matching placebo for 24 hours plus standard care). In the LeoPARDS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean SOFA score over the stay in the ICU (6.68 points vs. 6.06 points; AD 0.61 points, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.29). In the LeoPARDS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death at 28 days (34.5% vs. 30.9%; AD 3.6%, 95% CI -4.5 to 11.7) No significant difference in the rate of major acute kidney events within 28 days (57.4% vs. 54.3%; AD 3.1%, 95% CI -5.5 to 11.6) No significant difference in ventilator-free days (16 days vs. 19 days; AD -3 days, 95% CI -9.5 to 1). In the LeoPARDS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse event, life-threatening arrhythmia, and bradycardia. significant difference in supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (3.1% vs. 0.4%). In the LeoPARDS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with sepsis who had received vasopressors for at least 4 hours, levosimendan was not superior to placebo with respect to mean SOFA score over the stay in the ICU.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021—Levosimendan in septic shock shows no mortality benefit and carries a weak recommendation against use. A meta-analysis of three RCTs (n = 781) reported no mortality effect for levosimendan versus no inotropic agents (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.28). Data from the LeoPARDS trial (n = 515) associated levosimendan versus no inotropic agents with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs comparing levosimendan with dobutamine found no mortality advantage (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.48, 1.33; p = 0.39), and the panel issued “a weak recommendation against the use of levosimendan based on the lack of benefit, in addition to the safety profile, cost and the limited availability of the drug.”

### BET 1: levosimendan in septic shock [^b6c2e356]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A shortcut review was carried out to establish whether levosimendan improves outcome in septic shock. Eight studies were directly relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient groups studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that there is as yet no evidence that levosimendan reduces mortality from septic shock. The LeoPARDS trial may change that.

Levosimendan in patients with septic shock

Experimentally, in septic rabbits, levosimendan yields a similar improvement in left ventricular systolic function, when compared to dobutamine or milrinone, but improves diastolic function to a greater extent. A large multicenter randomized controlled trial assessed the effect of levosimendan on organ dysfunction in adult patients with septic shock at day 28, but failed to show a reduction in organ dysfunction or mortality when added to standard care. Moreover, patients who were assigned to receive levosimendan required more norepinephrine, were less likely to be weaned from mechanical ventilation, and had more atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, in a sub-group analysis of the LeoPARDS trial, Antcliffe et al. used the biomarkers cTnI and NT-proBNP to identify patients with evidence of myocardial injury and dysfunction, respectively. These authors did not observe any benefit from using levosimendan in any subgroup classified by a variety of biomarker cut-off thresholds. No data suggests differences in outcome between dobutamine and levosimendan in septic shock patients. Levosimendan might potentially remain useful in case of septic shock patients admitted with beta-blocker therapies that could participate to their circulatory failure.

Prophylactic Levosimendan in cardiac surgical patients with low LVEF

Although two large randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in composite endpoints reflecting low cardiac output syndrome and mortality in a mixed population of CABG, valvular, or combined surgery with LVEF< 40%, a recent meta-analysis suggested that there could be a greater benefit in the isolated CABG population. This exploratory finding is a strong incentive to re-evaluate the preoperative infusion of levosimendan prior to CABG surgery in patients with poor LVEF.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^6c4b66fd]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Levosimendan

Septic cardiomyopathy resulting in a low cardiac output state is relatively common in patients with refractory septic shock. Central venous saturations (ScvO 2) may be difficult to interpret in this context due to significant impairment of oxygen utilisation. Screening echocardiography identifies those patients with moderate to severely impaired myocardial function and may exclude primary cardiogenic causes. Dobutamine has traditionally been used in this context, but exacerbation of existing tachycardia and increased myocardial oxygen consumption limit its usefulness. Alternatively, improved cardiac function can be achieved using levosimendan in conjunction with the maintenance of ionised calcium levels greater than 1.2 mmol/l. Although the LeoPARDS trial found no benefit with levosimendan in patients with sepsis, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to a subgroup with refractory shock. Only 10% of the patients studied demonstrated evidence of a low cardiac output state and mortality was much lower than would be expected in this subgroup. Our practice is to administer levosimendan to patients with echocardiographic features of moderate to severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and impaired end-organ perfusion. Concerns over the potential need for increased vasopressor requirements can be mitigated by many of the points previously described in this article.

Epoprostenol and heparin

Intravenous prostacyclin has beneficial effects on microcirculatory flow. It has been shown to increase oxygen delivery in critically ill patients and successfully reverse symmetrical peripheral limb ischaemia secondary to high-dose vasopressors in septic shock. Its wider use is frequently limited by concerns over exacerbating hypotension; other vasodilators such as nitrates are used by other centres, but in our experience do not appear to be as effective. In patients with refractory septic shock with peripheral mottling we commence a low-dose epoprostenol infusion (0.5–5 ng/kg/min) to improve microcirculatory flow and prevent the occurrence of peripheral thrombotic events. Our experience is that peripheral ischaemic complications are reduced and haemodynamic compromise is rarely encountered if the prostacyclin infusion is titrated up very slowly. In the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation and suspicion of end-organ microthrombosis, and in the absence of absolute contra-indications, we also initiate low-dose intravenous heparin infusion (fixed rate 250–500 IU/h).

### Levosimendan in septic shock in patients with biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction: a subgroup analysis of the leoPARDS randomised trial [^c99f0e6b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Myocardial dysfunction is common in sepsis but optimal treatment strategies are unclear. The inodilator, levosimendan was suggested as a possible therapy; however, the levosimendan to prevent acute organ dysfunction in Sepsis (LeoPARDS) trial found it to have no benefit in reducing organ dysfunction in septic shock. In this study we evaluated the effects of levosimendan in patients with and without biochemical cardiac dysfunction and examined its non-inotropic effects.

Methods

Two cardiac biomarkers, troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and five inflammatory mediators were measured in plasma from patients recruited to the LeoPARDS trial at baseline and over the first 6 days. Mean total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and 28-day mortality were compared between patients with normal and raised cTnI and NT-proBNP values, and between patients above and below median values.

Results

Levosimendan produced no benefit in SOFA score or 28-day mortality in patients with cardiac dysfunction. There was a statistically significant treatment by subgroup interaction (p=0.04) in patients with NT-proBNP above or below the median value. Those with NT-proBNP values above the median receiving levosimendan had higher SOFA scores than those receiving placebo (mean daily total SOFA score 7.64 (4.41) vs 6.09 (3.88), mean difference 1.55, 95% CI 0.43-2.68). Levosimendan had no effect on the rate of decline of inflammatory biomarkers.

Conclusion

Adding levosimendan to standard care in septic shock was not associated with less severe organ dysfunction nor lower mortality in patients with biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction.

Conclusions

It could be demonstrated for the first time that levosimendan reduces oxidative burst activity of PMN both in vitro and in patients with acute heart failure or septic shock with septic myocardial depression. This may contribute to the anticipated cardioprotective effects of the drug.

### Levosimendan inhibits release of reactive oxygen species in polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro and in patients with acute heart failure and septic shock: a prospective observational study [^244793ee]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

• Levosimendan significantly reduces oxidative burst activity of PMN from healthy volunteers.

• Immunomodulation (reduced PMN burst activity) by levosimendan can also be observed in critically ill patients suffering from septic shock with septic myocardial depression or acute heart failure.

• Levosimendan as a substance does not exhibit free radical scavenging properties.

### Levosimendan in the light of the results of the recent randomized controlled trials: an expert opinion paper [^38163247]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite interesting and unique pharmacological properties, levosimendan has not proven a clear superiority to placebo in the patient populations that have been enrolled in the various recent multicenter randomized controlled trials. However, the pharmacodynamic effects of levosimendan are still considered potentially very useful in a number of specific situations.Patients with decompensated heart failure requiring inotropic support and receiving beta-blockers represent the most widely accepted indication. Repeated infusions of levosimendan are increasingly used to facilitate weaning from dobutamine and avoid prolonged hospitalizations in patients with end-stage heart failure, awaiting heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation. New trials are under way to confirm or refute the potential usefulness of levosimendan to facilitate weaning from veno-arterial ECMO, to treat cardiogenic shock due to left or right ventricular failure because the current evidence is mostly retrospective and requires confirmation with better-designed studies. Takotsubo syndrome may represent an ideal target for this non-adrenergic inotrope, but this statement also relies on expert opinion. There is no benefit from levosimendan in patients with septic shock. The two large trials evaluating the prophylactic administration of levosimendan (pharmacological preconditioning) in cardiac surgical patients with poor left ventricular ejection fraction could not show a significant reduction in their composite endpoints reflecting low cardiac output syndrome with respect to placebo. However, the subgroup of those who underwent isolated CABG appeared to have a reduction in mortality. A new study will be required to confirm this exploratory finding.Levosimendan remains a potentially useful inodilator agent in a number of specific situations due to its unique pharmacological properties. More studies are needed to provide a higher level of proof regarding these indications.

### Sepsis and the heart [^2d30487e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Septic shock, the most severe complication of sepsis, accounts for approximately 10% of all admissions to intensive care. Our understanding of its complex pathophysiology remains incomplete but clearly involves stimulation of the immune system with subsequent inflammation and microvascular dysfunction. Cardiovascular dysfunction is pronounced and characterized by elements of hypovolaemic, cytotoxic, and distributive shock. In addition, significant myocardial depression is commonly observed. This septic cardiomyopathy is characterized by biventricular impairment of intrinsic myocardial contractility, with a subsequent reduction in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and LV stroke work index. This review details the myocardial dysfunction observed in adult septic shock, and discusses the underlying pathophysiology. The utility of using the regulatory protein troponin for the detection of myocardial dysfunction is also considered. Finally, options for the management of sepsis-induced LV hypokinesia are discussed, including the use of levosimendan.

### In vivo and in vitro evidence for pleiotropic effects of levosimendan in the intensive care setting [^af026b97]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Levosimendan, in addition to its inotropic properties, could have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, and can potentially decrease the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the tissues. In their study, Hasslacher and colleagues provided not only in vitro but also in vivo evidence that levosimendan could preserve organ function in acute heart failure and septic-shock-induced myocardial depression via cooling down the oxidative burst of circulating cells.

### Levosimendan does not provide mortality benefit over dobutamine in adult patients with septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cab3ea71]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite of advancement in intensive care medicine, sepsis and septic shock carry a high mortality. Levosimendan, an inodilator, may be promising for septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction; however, firm evidence is lacking. In this meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials, levosimendan has been compared with dobutamine in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Intensive-care unit.

Participants

Adult septic shock patients.

Intervention

Adult septic shock patients received dobutamine or levosimendan.

Main Outcome Measure

Mortality at longest follow-up, blood lactate level, cardiac index and noradrenaline requirement.

Results

Data from 7 randomized trials have been included in this meta-analysis. Levosimendan has no benefit in terms of mortality at longest follow up in comparison to dobutamine (Odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.45, 132; p=0.34) and length of ICU stay (MD -4.7days, 95% CI -10.3, 0.9days, p=0.10). Patients received levosimendan had less blood lactate level (standardized mean difference -0.95; 95% CI -1.64, -0.27; p=0.006) and higher cardiac index (mean difference 0.44; 95% CI 0.17, 0.71; p=0.001). Noradrenaline requirements are similar in both the groups.

Conclusion

There is no evidence that levosimendan is superior to dobutamine in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. Further large randomized trials are necessary in this area.

### Effects of levosimendan on systemic and regional hemodynamics in septic myocardial depression [^2124eb19]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Calcium desensitization plays an important part in the pathophysiology of septic myocardial depression. We postulated that levosimendan, a new calcium sensitizer, would be beneficial in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.

Design and Setting

Prospective, randomized, controlled study in two university hospital intensive care units.

Patients and Participants

Twenty-eight patients with persisting left ventricular dysfunction related to septic shock after 48 h of conventional treatment including dobutamine (5 microg/kg per minute).

Interventions

After 48 h of conventional treatment patients were randomized to receive a 24-h infusion of either levosimendan (0.2 microg/kg per minute, n=15) or dobutamine (5 microg/kg per minute, n=13).

Measurements and Results

Data from right heart catheterization, echocardiography, gastric tonometry, laser-Doppler flowmetry, and lactate concentrations and creatinine clearance were obtained before and after the 24-h drug infusion. Dobutamine did not change systemic or regional hemodynamic variables. By contrast, at the same mean arterial pressure levosimendan decreased pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and increased cardiac index. Levosimendan decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and increased left ventricular ejection fraction. Levosimendan increased gastric mucosal flow, creatinine clearance, and urinary output while it decreased lactate concentrations.

Conclusions

These findings show that levosimendan improves systemic hemodynamics and regional perfusion in patients with septic cardiac dysfunction under conditions where administration of 5 microg/kg dobutamine per minute is no longer efficacious. Accordingly, our results suggest that levosimendan can be an alternative to the strategy of increasing the dose of dobutamine under such conditions.

### Minimizing catecholamines and optimizing perfusion [^1248ba15]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

For increasing cardiac output, dobutamine is the agent of choice. It is characterized by a short half-life and has minimal adverse effects at usual doses. In patients with septic shock, dobutamine increased oxygen delivery with minimal impact on MAP. In most cases, the increase in cardiac output was related to an increase in stroke volume more. In another trial, it was nevertheless noted that the increase in cardiac output was in some case related more to an increase in heart rate than in stroke volume. In addition, one should note that metabolic effects can be observed mostly when high doses of beta-adrenergic agents are used. Hence, one should always use the minimal dose associated with the desired hemodynamic effect and wean it as soon as possible. Non-adrenergic alternatives include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and levosimendan. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors like enoximone and milrinone are characterized by a long half-life and associate vasodilatory to the inotropic properties. Hypotension is often encountered and often limit/prevent the use of these agents in septic shock. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, is an attractive alternative. Unfortunately, it is also associated with vasodilatory properties and with a very long half-life. This latter property makes this agent not optimal for therapy in septic patients as its action (positive inotropy as well as adverse effects) would remain present for 5–7 days. Of note, a prolonged effect is not desired in septic shock as myocardial depression usually resolves over a few days, and hence, indication for inotropic stimulation also disappears. In a small size trial, levosimendan was effective in increasing cardiac output and improving gastric perfusion. Even though it has limited impact on blood pressure, the amount of fluids administered was also higher in patients receiving levosimendan. In a randomized trial, levosimendan was ineffective in preventing new-onset organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, the indication to administrate levosimendan in that trial was not triggered on hemodynamic endpoints (no cardiac output measurements and no assessment of cardiac function). Indeed, as for other inotropic agents, levosimendan should only be administered in patients with tissue hypoperfusion related to an inadequate cardiac output associated with altered contractility. Accordingly, the hypothesis of whether levosimendan could improve, or not, tissue perfusion in patients with inadequate cardiac output in sepsis was not tested.

Dobutamine remains thus the inotropic agent of choice in sepsis, even though other inotropic agents may offer interesting alternatives in some conditions.

### Effects of levosimendan on mortality and hospitalization. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^d2ae9977]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Catecholaminergic inotropes have a place in the management of low output syndrome and decompensated heart failure but their effect on mortality is debated. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that enhances myocardial contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen use. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the impact of levosimendan on mortality and hospital stay.

Data Sources

BioMedCentral, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials were searched for pertinent studies. International experts and the manufacturer were contacted.

Study Selection

Articles were assessed by four trained investigators, with divergences resolved by consensus. Inclusion criteria were random allocation to treatment and comparison of levosimendan vs. control. There were no restrictions on dose or time of levosimendan administration or on language. Exclusion criteria were: duplicate publications, nonadult studies, oral administration of levosimendan, and no data on main outcomes.

Data Extraction

Study end points, main outcomes, study design, population, clinical setting, levosimendan dosage, and treatment duration were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Data from 5,480 patients in 45 randomized clinical trials were analyzed. The overall mortality rate was 17.4% (507 of 2,915) among levosimendan-treated patients and 23.3% (598 of 2,565) in the control group (risk ratio 0.80 [0.72; 0.89], p for effect <.001, number needed to treat = 17 with 45 studies included). Reduction in mortality was confirmed in studies with placebo (risk ratio 0.82 [0.69; 0.97], p = .02) or dobutamine (risk ratio 0.68 [0.52-0.88]; p = .003) as comparator and in studies performed in cardiac surgery (risk ratio 0.52 [0.35; 0.76] p = .001) or cardiology (risk ratio 0.75 [0.63; 0.91], p = .003) settings. Length of hospital stay was reduced in the levosimendan group (weighted mean difference = -1.31 [-1.95; -0.31], p for effect = .007, with 17 studies included). A trend toward a higher percentage of patients experiencing hypotension was noted in levosimendan vs. control (risk ratio 1.39 [0.97-1.94], p = .053).

Conclusions

Levosimendan might reduce mortality in cardiac surgery and cardiology settings of adult patients.

Levosimendan in cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular failure

Although the classical hemodynamic profile of cardiogenic shock associates low cardiac output, low arterial pressure, elevated left/right ventricular diastolic pressure, and elevated systemic vascular resistance, other phenotypes can be encountered. Some shock states related to ischemia-reperfusion injury lead to a sepsis-like syndrome with low systemic vascular resistance, while others, on the contrary, present with maintained arterial pressure and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion due to a dramatic increase in systemic vascular resistance.

Unlike dobutamine, levosimendan increases moderately myocardial oxygen consumption, does not alter diastolic function, and has less direct pro-arrhythmic effects. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, levosimendan acts independently of beta-adrenergic receptors activation and is therefore not sensitive to the action of beta-blockers. There are, however, potential difficulties to use levosimendan in cardiogenic shock. Levosimendan is also a potent vasodilator, which in the context of vasoplegic patients or in vasopressor-dependent patients might be associated to hypotension leading to increased vasopressor requirement. Finally, the very long half-life of levosimendan is a double-edged sword. This property is particularly interesting to wean the patient from catecholamines, but on the other hand, it may be difficult to rapidly reverse the vasodilation once the drug has been administered.

Evaluation of and therapeutic approach for cardiovascular dysfunction

Cardiac output measurements provide only one part of the information. However, it is very important to evaluate whether or not cardiac output is adequate. Adequacy of cardiac output can be evaluated by ScvO 2 or SvO 2, in addition to signs of tissue perfusion.

In addition, measurements of filling pressures or volumes of cardiac chambers can be helpful to evaluate the cardiovascular performance.

When deciding to treat or not an alteration in myocardial contractility, it is important to evaluate the consequences of the impaired contractility: is cardiac output inadequate and is it associated with impaired tissue perfusion? Indeed, the relationship between contractility and cardiac output is relatively loose. Some patients may have decreased contractility with preserved cardiac output, and these patients should not be treated with inotropic agents. Other patients may have a low cardiac output and these patients should also not be treated with inotropic agents. Only patients with a low cardiac output related to an impaired contractility may benefit from inotropic agents.

A recent trial illustrated the need for individualizing therapy in this domain. In the trial administering levosimendan to patients with septic shock, the addition of levosimendan to standard treatment was not associated with a lower incidence of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or lower mortality. However, levosimendan was associated with higher risk of tachyarrhythmia. Admittedly, this trial was not optimally designed, as cardiac output and cardiac function were not evaluated so that patients with high cardiac output and/or high contractility may have received levosimendan even when not required or even when contraindicated. Indeed, one-fifth of the patients with septic shock may present left ventricular outflow tract or mid-ventricular obstruction, which contraindicates the use of inotropic stimulation. Hence, individualization of therapies, based on hemodynamic assessment, is the preferred approach in these patients.

Pharmacological properties of levosimendan

Levosimendan has a pharmacodynamic profile combining inotropic and vasodilating effects (inodilator), and a nearly unique (among inotropes) myocardial protective effect. The inotropic effect results, in part, from an increased affinity of troponin C for calcium when the drug is present, which in turn prolongs the duration of actin/myosin cross-bridges. This explains an increased contractility which is not associated with a raise in intracytoplasmic calcium concentration. Therefore, this inotropic effect does not generate a direct significant increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, since most of the myocardial energy expenditure is related to the diastolic uptake of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, levosimendan and its metabolite have also been shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase III, an action that may participate to the positive inotropic effect via the c-AMP pathway, but that might, in turn, increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Levosimendan is a potent vasodilator through the opening of ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscles. It has been associated with a variety of myocardial protective effects against ischemia (preconditioning, postconditioning, anti-stunning, and anti-apoptotic effects) that are related to the opening of the same channels within the mitochondria of cardiac myocytes, but the clinical evidence supporting these experimental findings is limited.

From the pharmacokinetic point of view, levosimendan has a fast onset of action and a half-life of 1 h. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism (acetylation) followed by renal excretion. Quite uniquely, it has an active metabolite with a very long half-life (70–80 h) responsible for a prolonged effect. All these characteristics offer opportunities to provide an ideal therapeutic response to specific situations. Nevertheless, the longer half-life, as compared to catecholamines, may change the way clinicians manage side effects (e.g. arterial hypotension) and may sometimes prove inconvenient when quick reversibility is desirable. The most frequent adverse event associated with levosimendan administration is hypotension requiring norepinephrine infusion, although its prevalence was not significantly greater with respect to placebo or dobutamine in the largest RCTs published. In patients with septic shock, however, the cardiovascular dysfunction (reflected using the SOFA score) was more profound in patients receiving levosimendan. These trials also found a greater proportion of patients receiving levosimendan developing atrial fibrillation, but the difference with the comparator group reached statistical significance only in medical heart failure and septic shock patients.

Several studies have also addressed the use of levosimendan as a potent inotropic substance in sepsis and septic shock [-] showing beneficial effects on systemic hemodynamics and regional perfusion as well as microcirculatory blood flow. A recent study focused on the beneficial combination of levosimendan and glibenclamide in septic shock, where levosimendan was supposed to antagonize cardiodepression and glibenclamide to inhibit sepsis-induced vasodilatory effects. Despite increasing evidence to extend the indication of levosimendan to sepsis-induced myocardial depression in critically ill patients there is still a lack of knowledge about its exact mechanisms of action in this specific clinical setting.

The aim of the present study was to investigate antiinflammatory and antioxidative properties of levosimendan by determining its effect in human PMN. For this purpose we examined the in vitro effects of levosimendan on the release of ROS, surface expression of adhesion molecules as well as apoptosis in PMN isolated from healthy volunteers. Additionally, we conducted an observational study in critically ill patients treated with levosimendan for acute heart failure or septic shock with sepsis-associated myocardial depression exploring direct drug effects of levosimendan on respiratory burst activity of PMN isolated from these patients.

Implications for treatment

Currently, no treatment recommendations exist that specifically address the presence of SC. Patients with SC may be at greater risk for excessive fluid resuscitation and more likely to require inotropic support, as hypoperfusion would less likely be corrected by IVF administration alone. However, data comparing use of vasopressors, inotropes, and other treatments in patients with and without SC are scant and subject to extensive confounding. Where treatment data are stratified by presence or absence of SC, only two found significant differences between groups. Brown et al. found that patients with less severe DD received less IVF than those with more significant abnormalities (2.6 versus 5.5 l). Pulido et al. reported higher doses of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in patients with LV and RV systolic dysfunction, but no overall difference in the number of patients receiving it. Establishment of a standardized, objective definition of SC and adoption of more uniform study protocols amongst research groups would improve understanding of differences in treatment requirements for patients with SC.

Positive inotropic agents have the same putative benefits of vasopressors—increasing CO, thereby improving oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues. Recommendations to titrate therapy to central venous oxygen saturation > 65% are of uncertain utility, as a normal value does not necessarily indicate adequate resuscitation. Furthermore, excessive β stimulation may be harmful, and there is some evidence that β-blockade may be beneficial in some patients. Preliminary trials of levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer and positive inotrope, reported reduced mortality, but no benefit was found in a subsequent larger study.

### Levosimendan for the prevention of acute organ dysfunction in sepsis [^90aa2926]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitizing drug with inotropic and other properties that may improve outcomes in patients with sepsis.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to investigate whether levosimendan reduces the severity of organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a blinded infusion of levosimendan (at a dose of 0.05 to 0.2 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute) for 24 hours or placebo in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was the mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the intensive care unit up to day 28 (scores for each of five systems range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction; maximum score, 20). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and adverse events.

Results

The trial recruited 516 patients; 259 were assigned to receive levosimendan and 257 to receive placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean (±SD) SOFA score between the levosimendan group and the placebo group (6.68±3.96 vs. 6.06±3.89; mean difference, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.07 to 1.29; P=0.053). Mortality at 28 days was 34.5% in the levosimendan group and 30.9% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 3.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.5 to 11.7; P=0.43). Among patients requiring ventilation at baseline, those in the levosimendan group were less likely than those in the placebo group to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation over the period of 28 days (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P=0.03). More patients in the levosimendan group than in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (3.1% vs. 0.4%; absolute difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 5.3; P=0.04).

Conclusions

The addition of levosimendan to standard treatment in adults with sepsis was not associated with less severe organ dysfunction or lower mortality. Levosimendan was associated with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### Levosimendan and mortality after coronary revascularisation: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^50d03c56]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis evaluated the use of levosimendan in a variety of patient populations that included post-cardiac surgery, post-vascular surgery, sepsis, decompensated heart failure and post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction in sepsis, after non-cardiac surgery and in the context of cardiogenic shock, are all quite disparate. This implies that vasoactive drugs may perform differently, depending on the prevailing mechanism of shock making the interpretation of a pooled analysis of such a heterogeneous group of patients difficult. For this reason we limited this meta-analysis to patients having coronary revascularisation.

Overall, this study shows a mortality benefit when levosimendan was used in patients having coronary revascularisation. The effect was significant in the elective revascularisation group. The subset of patients undergoing emergency revascularisation was under-represented and the mortality benefit in this group was not statistically significant. This latter analysis is probably underpowered. Additionally, levosimendan was associated with favourable outcomes in several clinically important endpoints. The rate of post-revascularisation atrial fibrillation was reduced. Atrial fibrillation after coronary revascularisation is associated with a prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity and long-term mortality. The analysis also found levosimendan to be associated with a reduction in peri-procedural cardiac troponin I levels. Elevations in cardiac troponin I levels are a valuable marker of myocardial damage after coronary revascularisation and have been associated with a significantly higher rate of in-hospital and long-term mortality [-]. The haemodynamic response to levosimendan was also favourable. It is likely that the improvement of haemodynamic profile observed with levosimendan can be sustained for a longer period of time compared to dobutamine or milrinone. This is because levosimendan has a poorly protein-bound active metabolite and may exert clinical effects for up to a week, at a much lower energy expenditure than conventional inotropes.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^e39963ed]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock—vasopressor initiation and escalation (SSC): Vasopressin is typically used at a fixed dose of 0.03 units per minute, and a systematic review of 10 RCTs by the SSC found reduced mortality when vasopressin was combined with norepinephrine versus norepinephrine alone (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99) with no difference in risks of digital ischemia or arrhythmias. A new weak recommendation from the SSC suggests that for adults with septic shock, vasopressors should be started by peripheral intravenous access to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured, and there is a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Alternatives to norepinephrine, if not available, include epinephrine or dopamine; if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine, it is suggested to add vasopressin rather than escalating the dose of norepinephrine, and if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, it is suggested to add epinephrine. For septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, the SSC suggests adding either dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone, while a new weak recommendation suggests against using levosimendan.

### Effects of levosimendan for low cardiac output syndrome in critically ill patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^6a04b74a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the benefits and harms of levosimendan for low cardiac output syndrome in critically ill patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) of randomised clinical trials comparing levosimendan with any type of control. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion. The Cochrane Collaboration methodology was used. Random-effects risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were derived for the principal primary outcome mortality at maximal follow-up.

Results

A total of 88 trials were included in the systematic review and 49 trials (6,688 patients) in the meta-analysis. One trial had low risk of bias and nine trials (2,490 patients) were considered lower risk of bias. Trials compared levosimendan with placebo, control interventions, and other inotropes. Pooling all trials including heterogenous populations was considered inappropriate. Pooled analysis of 30 trials including critically ill patients not having cardiac surgery showed an association between levosimendan and mortality (RR 0.83, TSA-adjusted 95 % CI 0.59-0.97), while trials with lower risk of bias showed no significant difference (RR 0.83, TSA-adjusted 95 % CI 0.48-1.55). Conventional meta-analysis of all 14 trials including cardiac surgery patients showed an association, while lower risk of bias trials showed no association between levosimendan and mortality (RR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.37-0.73 versus RR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.48-2.16).

Conclusions

The available evidence is inconclusive whether or not levosimendan may have a beneficial effect on mortality due to risks of systematic errors and random errors. Further well-designed randomised trials are needed.

Potential non-routine (niche) indications for levosimendan (Fig. 1)

Levosimendan for heart failure patients receiving beta-blockers

Patients receiving beta-blockers (BB) in an acute or chronic setting have an altered beta-adrenergic receptor function and are therefore unlikely to respond optimally to catecholamines. The relevant clinical contexts are as follows: (i) patients with acute myocardial infarction given BB prophylactically who subsequently develop cardiogenic shock and require inotropic support, (ii) patients with chronic heart failure who are under chronic BB therapy and have acute on chronic cardiac decompensation, and (iii) patients with accidental/intentional BB intoxication. When beta-adrenergic receptors number and/or function are decreased, levosimendan appears as the drug of choice because its mechanisms of action are independent of this receptor. This is supported by a few experimental and clinical studies. In an animal model of acute intoxication with propranolol, Leppikangas et al. demonstrated that levosimendan, but not dobutamine or placebo, was able to increase stroke volume, inotropism, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. This was associated with a 100% survival of animals with levosimendan, as compared to 20% with dobutamine or placebo. In a small number (n = 52) of patients with acute or chronic heart failure and treated with beta-blockers, a prospective randomized double-blind international study found that levosimendan, as opposed to dobutamine, increased cardiac index and decreased pulmonary capillary wedged pressure, but failed to improve clinical symptoms and mixed venous oxygen saturation. In addition, exploratory findings in favor of levosimendan were also reported from subgroup analyses of the LIDO and SURVIVE studies, comparing patients receiving beta-blockers versus those not receiving these drugs. Based on these possible beneficial hemodynamic effects, levosimendan is now considered the first-choice drug in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and on beta-blockers, if beta-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypotension with subsequent hypoperfusion (class IIb, evidence level C).

### A randomized controlled trial of levosimendan to reduce mortality in high-risk cardiac surgery patients (CHEETAH): rationale and design [^ca95d84a]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of perioperative low cardiac output syndrome due to postoperative myocardial dysfunction. Myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is a potential indication for the use of levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer with 3 beneficial cardiovascular effects (inotropic, vasodilatory, and anti-inflammatory), which appears effective in improving clinically relevant outcomes.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter randomized trial.

Setting

Tertiary care hospitals.

Interventions

Cardiac surgery patients (n = 1,000) with postoperative myocardial dysfunction (defined as patients with intraaortic balloon pump and/or high-dose standard inotropic support) will be randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either levosimendan (0.05-0.2 μg/[kg min]) or placebo for 24-48 hours.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary end point will be 30-day mortality. Secondary end points will be mortality at 1 year, time on mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, decision to stop the study drug due to adverse events or to start open-label levosimendan, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. We will test the hypothesis that levosimendan reduces 30-day mortality in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative myocardial dysfunction.

Conclusions

This trial is planned to determine whether levosimendan could improve survival in patients with postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial may provide important insights into the management of low cardiac output in cardiac surgery.

• Levosimendan improves sublingual microcirculatory blood flow in volume-resuscitated septic shock patients.

• Levosimendan enhances convection and improves diffusion, thereby improving oxygen delivery at the level of the microcirculation.

• Levosimendan at 0.2 μg/kg per minute may be more effective than a standard dose of 5 μg/kg per minute of dobutamine for improving microcirculatory blood flow.

• Under normovolemic conditions, levosimendan administration did not influence arterial blood pressure or norepinephrine requirements.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our results show that intravenous administration of levosimendan can be a safe therapeutic option to reduce infarct size for patients with STEMI regardless of their LVEF and hemodynamic status. Although multicenter, randomized studies are needed to confirm our results, the LEVOCEST clinical trial could lay the groundwork for a new indication for the drug, establishing a new cardioprotective strategy for disease management in routine clinical practice and, ultimately, changing the paradigm of acute myocardial infarction treatment.

### Randomized clinical trials with levosimendan [^954dc5ca]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There are important unmet needs in the treatment of acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS). The unique dual mechanism of action of levosimendan suggests that this new agent may help fill some of these unmet needs. A review of randomized, controlled clinical trials with levosimendan demonstrated that it is well tolerated, and its use results in significantly reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increased cardiac output. Effects of levosimendan on PCWP and cardiac output are more pronounced than those observed with dobutamine. Levosimendan treatment is also associated with significantly improved clinical symptoms. Moreover, data from 3 trials indicate that levosimendan treatment was associated with improved 6-month survival compared with dobutamine treatment or placebo. Emerging data suggest that levosimendan is beneficial for patients with acute myocardial ischemia. Thus, early clinical indicators suggest that levosimendan may help prevent myocardial injury during hospitalization for AHFS and may be well suited for first-line therapy for AHFS.

Methods

Study approvals and RCT datasets

We obtained ethics approval for this study (18/LO/1079). VANISH was a 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind, RCT in adult patients with sepsis who required vasopressors, in 18 general adult intensive care units (ICUs) in the United Kingdom (UK). In the VANISH trial, patients were randomly allocated to vasopressin and hydrocortisone (n = 101), vasopressin and placebo (n = 104), norepinephrine and hydrocortisone (n = 101) or norepinephrine and placebo (n = 103). Patients only received the second study drug (hydrocortisone/placebo) if the maximum infusion of the first study drug (vasopressin/norepinephrine) had been reached. Therefore, in the hydrocortisone analysis, only participants who received the study drug were included (hydrocortisone n = 148, placebo n = 148); all remaining analyses are intention-to-treat. The 28-day mortality was 63/204 (30.9%) of patients in the vasopressin group and 56/204 (27.5%) patients in the norepinephrine group (difference = 3.4% [95% CI, − 5.4–12.3%]). LeoPARDS was a two-arm parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in adult patients with sepsis who required vasopressors, in 34 ICUs in the UK. In LeoPARDS trial, patients were randomised to receive either levosimendan (n = 258) or placebo (n = 257) over 24 h in addition to standard care. The 28-day mortality was 89/258 (34.5%) in the levosimendan group and 79/256 (30.9%) in the placebo group (difference = 3.6% [95% CI, − 4.5–11.7%]). HARP-2 was a two-arm parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in adult patients within 48 h after the onset of ARDS in 40 ICUs in the UK and Ireland. In the HARP-2 trial, patients were randomised to receive either once-daily simvastatin or identical placebo tablets enterally for up to 28 days. The 28-day mortality was 57/259 (22.0%) in the simvastatin group and 75/280 (26.8%) in the placebo group (risk ratio = 0.8 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1]).]

### Heterogeneity of treatment effect by baseline risk of mortality in critically ill patients: re-analysis of three recent sepsis and ARDS randomised controlled trials [^286a6c63]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-random variation in the treatment effect of an intervention due to differences in the baseline risk of death between patients in a population represents one form of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). In critical care settings, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are acute illnesses with significant clinical and biological heterogeneity. Therefore, it is possible that even in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which enrol patients that meet specific sepsis or ARDS eligibility criteria, there may still be heterogeneity in the trial populations. This heterogeneity occurs both within a trial and between trials. The resulting variation in risk of outcomes may result in clinically important HTE in such trial populations. This heterogeneity is one possible explanation for indeterminate results in sepsis and ARDS RCT. We use the term indeterminate to illustrate that statistically non-significant results of two-tailed tests suggest uncertainty in results, as opposed to proof of no difference between treatments, implied by the term negative.

Recently, Iwashyna and colleagues simulated RCTs using observational cohort data and highlighted that the magnitude of HTE may be such that the average benefit (or harm) from the tested treatment in critical care RCTs may not be valid for an individual patient meeting the trial eligibility criteria. Therefore, exploring HTE with data from completed RCTs where the intervention showed no effect in the overall population, aside from explaining the RCT results, could also inform future trial design and trial efficiency by targeting a trial population defined by a specific baseline measure associated either with the highest treatment benefit or with treatment response (enrichment).

In this context, we explored the presence of HTE for vasopressin and hydrocortisone in the VANISH trial, for levosimendan in the LeoPARDS trial and for simvastatin in the HARP-2 trial. We hypothesised that the individual patient’s baseline risk of death modifies the direction and magnitude of the treatment effects of vasopressin, hydrocortisone, levosimendan and simvastatin within these RCTs. A number of recent studies support our hypothesis. The treatment effect of vasopressin differed with severity of septic shock in a previous RCT. The treatment effect of hydrocortisone differed between trials, with potential benefit seen in trials with higher control group mortality. The treatment effect of simvastatin differed between ARDS sub-phenotypes and potentially with illness severity in critically ill patients.

### Heterogeneity of treatment effect by baseline risk of mortality in critically ill patients: re-analysis of three recent sepsis and ARDS randomised controlled trials [^e3a8e4b8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We assessed whether HTE could contribute to the indeterminate results in three recent ICU RCTs, using multivariable baseline risk of death models, which included well-established risk factors for acute mortality for sepsis and ARDS as covariates. There was considerable within-trial variation in the baseline risk of death in all three RCTs. We did not observe HTE for vasopressin, hydrocortisone and levosimendan in the two sepsis trials, though there was evidence of differential treatment effect in the HARP-2 trial for ARDS with low risk of death sub-population benefitting the most. We observed that detection of HTE in RCTs may be influenced by the baseline risk model specification, as illustrated by differences in HTE effects seen with different models reported using the LeoPARDS trial data.

Explanation of key findings

There are a number of possible reasons why we did not observe HTE consistently in all our analyses. All three trials we assessed have many features of explanatory trials, which by their design limit HTE in comparison to pragmatic trials, such as through narrower eligibility criteria, intensity of follow-up and non-mortality primary outcomes. Therefore, demonstrable HTE is less likely in these trials, though its evaluation remains important. Our findings may be true in that HTE may be less marked in sepsis and ARDS as mortality may be driven by non-modifiable risk factors such as older age and presence of comorbid conditions, alongside illness attributable risk, generating many “minimal contributory causes” of mortality, when compared to illnesses such as retroviral disease. It could be that the effects of treatments we assessed on mortality are both small and with limited variability across baseline risk of death resulting in minimal HTE. Another explanation for not observing HTE may be that there is no true treatment effect difference between subgroups enriched on prognosis with APACHE II score. Given the sample size in the trials assessed, we may only have power to detect large interaction effects, which requires either a large treatment effect in one or more subgroups, opposing treatment effects between subgroups or differential adverse event risk between subgroups.

### Rationale and design of the multicenter randomized trial investigating the effects of levosimendan pretreatment in patients with low ejection fraction (≤ 40%) undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (LICORN study) [^87c1309c]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Side effects of levosimendan and safety issues

According to the clinical data of REVIVE II and SURVIVE trials, moderate hypotension (mean reduction in systolic blood pressure: −4 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure: − 6 mmHg) was the most frequent adverse event observed after a bolus infusion of levosimendan (12 μg/kg) and lasted for 12 h. In the SURVIVE trial, the occurrence of hypotension did not differ between the levosimendan and dobutamine groups. However, based on this finding we will not administer any bolus of levosimendan in our patients in order to reduce the risk of intra-operative hypotension. Previous authors using a continuous infusion of levosimendan without a loading dose observed beneficial effects without hypotension. Moreover, 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure recommended the use of levosimendan without a loading dose for hypotensive patients.

Levosimendan administration has also been associated with a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation in comparison to a placebo (9 vs 2 %) or dobutamine (9 vs 6 %) in trials involving patients with left ventricular failure. In contrast, meta-analysis of studies involving surgical patients suggested a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation in the group of patients treated with levosimendan. We will collect information on the incidence of atrial fibrillation in our patients to try to provide new insight regarding these discrepant results. Atrial fibrillation detection will rely on continuous electrocardiography monitoring while in ICU, and on clinically patent arrhythmia episodes leading to 12-lead electrocardiography recording while in the ward. Information regarding other arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointe) will also be collected to assess the safety profile of levosimendan in the perioperative period.

Perioperative ischemia is a major concern after CABG surgery. The safety profile of levosimendan regarding the myocardial oxygen balance seems favourable in comparison to dobutamine. Previous studies involving CABG patients suggested that postoperative ischemia was less frequent in levosimendan-treated patients with respect to a placebo. Peak postoperative troponin I (between Day 1 and Day 2), measured by highly-sensitive troponin assay will be monitored at each center to assess myocardial damage.

### Mortality in septic patients treated with short-acting betablockers: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e55a41e9]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart rate control in atrial fibrillation using betablockers is already a well-established therapeutic approach. Interestingly, secondary analysis concerning cardiac rhythm at randomization indicated no significant effect on mortality, which may indicate a different response in patients with both sepsis and atrial fibrillation. However, this subgroup analysis is limited by the small sample size as well as considerable heterogeneity. The latest randomized controlled trials provided relatively homogenous inclusion criteria and study protocols, starting betablocker therapy after initial fluid resuscitation and titrating the drug to a target HR between 80 and 94 bpm. Interestingly, at least two of the Esmolol studies used levosimendan or milrinone. Hence, one may hypothesize that concomitant use of inotropes may be beneficial. Unfortunately, further data on this issue is lacking. While some trials delivered promising results while treating patients with esmolol, the largest multi-centered trials did not report a significant mortality reduction in the treated populations using landiolol. This is further supported by the results of our primary analysis. Based on these observations, two possible hypotheses could be postulated. First, esmolol may be more beneficial than landiolol, although the pharmacological properties of landiolol demonstrate superior selectivity, potency, and additional beneficial pharmacokinetic effects when compared to esmolol. However, one could hypothesize that less beta 1 -selectivity could also be beneficial. Notably, 25.4% of the patients treated with landiolol in the LANDI-SEP study presented serious drug-related adverse events, including hypotension and bradycardia. Secondly, the discrepancy between the results could be a problem of correct patient identification. Monitoring stroke volume would indicate any significant benefit or compromise from heart rate reduction as the tachycardia may be due either to sympathetic stimulation or compensatory to a sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy impaired cardiac function. The use of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population is currently under investigation in the ongoing HyperBetashock trial (NCT04748796) although LVEF has its own limitations due to reduced afterload attributed to the distributive shock in sepsis. One might suggest that other echocardiography measurements of diastolic dysfunction, such as septal relaxation e’ or speckle tracking, which remain afterload-independent, may be superior. Of the seven studies included in our meta-analysis, only three provided data on echocardiography. Of these, only Wang J. et al. used additional diagnostic methods. Using the proper tools to assess cardiac dysfunction may play a pivotal role in selecting patients who may benefit from beta 1 -blockade. Based on current data, however, these hypotheses remain purely speculative but are worth exploring in future investigations. Furthermore, the potential correlation between the efficacy of heart rate reduction and catecholamine usage or mortality remains a topic of particular interest. However, due to the incomplete availability of individual data, this could not be addressed in the present analysis.

### Safety and efficacy of a novel calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, in patients with left ventricular failure due to an acute myocardial infarction. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (RUSSLAN) [^dafe161d]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of levosimendan in patients with left ventricular failure complicating acute myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

Levosimendan at different doses (0.1-0.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or placebo were administered intravenously for 6h to 504 patients in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The primary end-point was hypotension or myocardial ischaemia of clinical significance adjudicated by an independent Safety Committee. Secondary end-points included risk of death and worsening heart failure, symptoms of heart failure and all-cause mortality. The incidence of ischaemia and/or hypotension was similar in all treatment groups (P=0.319). A higher frequency of ischaemia and/or hypotension was only seen in the highest levosimendan dose group. Levosimendan-treated patients experienced lower risk of death and worsening heart failure than patients receiving placebo, during both the 6h infusion (2.0% vs 5.9%; P=0.033) and over 24h (4.0% vs 8.8%; P=0.044). Mortality was lower with levosimendan compared with placebo at 14 days (11.7% vs 19.6%; hazard ratio 0.56 [95% CI 0.33-0.95];P =0.031) and the reduction was maintained at the 180-day retrospective follow-up (22.6% vs 31.4%; 0.67 [0.45-1.00],P =0.053).

Conclusion

s Levosimendan at doses 0.1-0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) did not induce hypotension or ischaemia and reduced the risk of worsening heart failure and death in patients with left ventricular failure complicating acute myocardial infarction.

### The effect of inotropes and vasopressors on mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^54e34c25]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inotropes and vasopressors are frequently administered to critically ill patients in order to improve haemodynamic function and restore adequate organ perfusion. However, some studies have suggested a possible association between inotrope administration and increased mortality. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials published in the last 20 yr to investigate the effect of these drugs on mortality.

Methods

BioMedCentral, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register were searched (all updated April 8th, 2015). Inclusion criteria were: random allocation to treatment, at least one group receiving an inotropic or vasopressor drug compared with at least one group receiving a non-inotropic/vasopressor treatment, study published after 1st January 1994, and systemic drug administration. Exclusion criteria were overlapping populations, studies published as abstract only, crossover studies, paediatric studies and lack of data on mortality.

Results

A total of 28 280 patients from 177 trials were included. Overall, pooled estimates showed no difference in mortality between the group receiving inotropes/vasopressors and the control group [4255/14 036 (31.7%) vs. 4277/14 244 (31.8%), risk ratio=0.98 (0.96-1.01), P for effect=0.23, P for heterogeneity=0.30, I2=6%]. A reduction in mortality was associated with inotrope/vasopressor therapy use in settings of vasoplegic syndromes, sepsis and cardiac surgery. Levosimendan was the only drug associated with improvement in survival. Subgroup analysis did not identify any groups with increased mortality associated with inotrope/vasopressor therapy.

Conclusions

Our systematic review found that inotrope/vasopressor therapy is not associated with differences in mortality in the overall population and in the majority of subsettings.

### Efficacy of levosimendan in the treatment of patients with severe septic cardiomyopathy [^1de6b1b5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to compare the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on hemodynamics and clinical efficacy in patients with severe septic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤35%).

Design

A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study.

Setting

In Baoding, China.

Participants

Thirty patients with severe septic cardiomyopathy treated in the authors' hospital's Department of Critical Medicine from September 2018 to September 2021 were enrolled in this study.

Interventions

These patients were divided randomly into the levosimendan group and dobutamine group. The LVEF, cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), systemic vascular resistance index, heart rate, norepinephrine dose, and lactate at the time of enrollment and the 24th hour were compared, along with myocardial injury markers on the third day, C-reactive protein, mechanical ventilation time, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, cost, and 28-day mortality. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

At the 24th hour after treatment, CI, LVEF, SVI, and fluid volume were found to be higher in the levosimendan group than in the dobutamine group, whereas the dose of norepinephrine was lower in the former rather than the latter group. On the third day of treatment, cardiac troponin I in the levosimendan group was lower than that in the dobutamine group. Although the differences in 28-day mortality, ICU stay, and ICU treatment cost between the groups were not statistically significant, the ventilator application time of the levosimendan group was significantly shorter than that of the dobutamine group.

Conclusions

Compared with dobutamine, levosimendan was more effective at improving cardiac function, reducing myocardial injury, and reducing mechanical ventilation time in patients with severe septic cardiomyopathy.

### The role of vasoactive agents in the resuscitation of microvascular perfusion and tissue oxygenation in critically ill patients [^88c4bbd4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Dopexamine (predominantly dopaminergic, also β 2 -adrenergic, Table 4) initially was introduced as an inotropic agent with specific pro splanchnic perfusion abilities. However, though dopexamine infusion was associated with a partial correction of spectrophotometric gastric Hbi O2, p CO 2g-a remained unaltered. This might be compatible with persistence of microcirculatory weak units in combination with shunting, not sensed by spectrophotometry due to incorporation of arteriolar and venular hemoglobin. The same dilemma was illustrated in another study. Dopexamine, in addition to volume loading and dobutamine, increased ICG-derived splanchnic blood flow, but with a concomitant decrease in pH i. Apart from this heterogeneity in blood flow between regional circulation and microcirculation, experimental data also suggested regional heterogeneity in blood flow between the gastric and colon region during the use of dopexamine in sepsis.

In postoperative cardiac surgery no difference in p CO 2 g-a between low-dose dopexamine and placebo could be detected. In another study pH i did not rise despite an increment in ICG-measured splanchnic blood flow and cardiac output. Apart from thermogenetic effects of dopexamine, this might also be explained by a distributive effect. To date, in postoperative non-cardiac surgery, the use of dopexamine remains a matter of debate.

Levosimendan (calcium sensitizer, Table 4) improves cardiac contractility and has slight vasodilatory effects. In patients with sepsis-induced myocardial depression levosimendan in addition to NE plus dobutamine was superior to an incremental dose of dobutamine, with respect to p CO 2g-a, laser Doppler-measured gastric mucosal perfusion, arterial lactate levels and creatinine clearance, either as a direct effect or as result of improved cardiac output. After abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery p CO 2 g-a was lower in the levosimendan group in comparison to placebo, but despite a higher cardiac output this was not a result of better regional splanchnic perfusion. In an experimental setting attenuation of sepsis-induced cellular hypoxia was observed, but simultaneous SDF-imaging failed to detect changes in microvascular blood flow.

### Early administration of levosimendan is associated with improved kidney function after cardiac surgery-a retrospective analysis [^61e703b1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

As early as 1984, Wilson et al. demonstrated impaired skeletal muscle nutritive flow during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure although stroke volume was optimized by dobutamine infusion. Consequently, improving haemodynamics is one among several aspects in the therapeutic course. Levosimendan, however, may also positively influence cell surviving beside its properties to restore haemodynamics,.

Most aforementioned studies investigated non-operative patients with decompensated heart failure. It might be possible that additional beneficial effects of levosimendan are attenuated by a systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) concomitant with cardiac surgery,. In experimental and clinical sepsis investigations, beneficial renal effects of levosimendan were only detectable if the drug improved haemodynamics -.

This study stands out for its pragmatic clinical approach in a real life environment. As for all retrospective approaches, our analysis was limited by the variables available in routine patient care. The number of patients analyzed in this study may be regarded as relatively high given the single centre setting and the chosen eligibility criteria. Since preoperative plasma creatinine, preoperative eGFR and overall disease severity as expressed by SAPS-II admission score were statistically comparable between groups, we found it reasonable to suggest that there was no statistical bias with respect to the investigated parameters. In our analysis, we can only assume that haemodynamics were optimised as specified in the recent S3 guideline. In a previous study conducted in a similar setting, there were no differences in use of norepinephrine, dobutamine and enoximone between patients receiving levosimendan or placebo. Beneficial effects of norepinephrine on kidney function have been described and would thus add to the properties of levosimendan. Nevertheless, additional factors like pharmalogical or mechanical support may have had a significant impact on outcome and suchlike issues need to be addressed in controlled trials. Further preoperative risk stratification using biomarkers might be another aspect of high interest for future prospective studies.

### Levosimendan may improve survival in patients requiring mechanical assist devices for post-cardiotomy heart failure [^90236256]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Not many data exist on long-term survival rates of patients receiving an assist device secondary to severe post-cardiotomy cardiac shock. Hoy and colleagues have reported 62 cases with implanted centrifugal pumps. In that study, 27 of the observed patients were able to be discharged from hospital, 9 died in the first year after discharge, 10 further survived for less than 5 years, 7 survived for 6 to 10 years and 1 patient survived for more than 10 years after the procedure.

The advantageous effects of levosimendan in patients with acute decompensated cardiac failure have been demonstrated in clinical trials. The multicenter RUSSLAN study investigated levosimendan in three different dosages versus placebo in patients with acutely impaired cardiac function due to myocardial infarction. The higher dosage of levosimendan (bolus 24 μg·kg -1 followed by infusion of 0.4 μg·kg -1 ·min -1) was associated with increased incidences of hypotension and ischemia compared to patients who received a bolus of 24 μg kg -1 followed by infusion of 0.2 μg × kg -1 × min -1 or patients who received a bolus of 12 μg kg -1 followed by infusion of 0.2 μg × kg -1 × min -1 or patients who received a bolus of 6 μg kg -1 followed by infusion of 0.1 μg × kg -1 × min -1. The total number of levosimendan treated patients showed a significantly reduced 14-day mortality (p = 0.031) and the 180-day mortality tended to be lower in the levosimendan groups (p = 0.053). The multicenter LIDO study investigated levosimendan versus placebo in patients with acute decompensated heart failure; 180-day survival was significantly improved in the levosimendan group (p = 0.029). No controlled studies have ever examined the effect of levosimendan administration in cardiac surgical patients with severe impairment of ventricular function. Lehmann and co-workers reported 10 patients with severe cardiogenic shock undergoing emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). These patients were treated with levosimendan. Two patients died and eight patients showed an excellent clinical outcome without further complications. One study showed a significant improvement of hemodynamic measurements in patients undergoing CABG surgery with normal ventricular function.

### Levosimendan for resuscitating the microcirculation in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled study [^75b94d3d]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first prospective, randomized clinical study investigating the effects of levosimendan on sublingual microcirculation in patients with septic shock. Our results demonstrate that levosimendan at 0.2 μg/kg per minute (when compared with a standard dose of 5 μg/kg per minute of dobutamine) improves sublingual microcirculatory blood flow in volume-resuscitated septic shock patients and that this effect was not correlated with changes in systemic flow variables.

### Levosimendan is superior to enoximone in refractory cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction [^c9e6df1a]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. The objectives were to investigate the effects of levosimendan, a novel inodilator, compared with the phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor enoximone in refractory cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, on top of current therapy.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled single-center clinical trial.

Setting

Medical and coronary intensive care unit in a university hospital.

Patients

Thirty-two patients with refractory cardiogenic shock for at least 2 hrs requiring additional therapy.

Interventions

Infusion of either levosimendan (12 microg/kg over 10 min, followed by 0.1 microg/kg/min over 50 min, and of 0.2 microg/kg/min for the next 23 hrs) or enoximone (fractional loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by 2-10 microg/kg/min continuously) after initiation of current therapy, always including revascularization, intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation, and inotropes.

Measurements and Main Results

Survival rate at 30 days was significantly higher in the levosimendan-treated group (69%, 11 of 16) compared with the enoximone group (37%, 6 of 16, p = 0.023). Invasive hemodynamic parameters during the first 48 hrs were comparable in both groups. Levosimendan induced a trend toward higher cardiac index, cardiac power index, left ventricular stroke work index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. In addition, lower cumulative values for catecholamines at 72 hrs and for clinical signs of inflammation were seen in the levosimendan-treated patients. Multiple organ failure leading to death occurred exclusively in the enoximone group (4 of 16 patients).

Conclusions

In severe and refractory cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, levosimendan, added to current therapy, may contribute to improved survival compared with enoximone.

### Sepsis-associated Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can be reversed with levosimendan [^c10a8d8f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a stressful physical condition, and at the acute phase, overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may occur; these events have the potential to induce cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a form of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy, which occurs very rarely in sepsis. However, TTC management in critically ill patients with sepsis may be challenging because the use of exogenous catecholamines for circulatory support might augment further TTC. Herein, we report a rare case of TTC after urosepsis; and we point out that cardiac function may improve after catecholamine withdrawal and the application of calcium channel sensitizer levosimendan.

### Levosimendan in cardiac surgery: current best available evidence [^9f983891]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Recent upsurge in referral of patients with high perioperative risk or compromised left ventricular function for cardiac surgery has lead to an increasing use of pharmacologic support in the form of vasodilator and inotropic therapy to achieve improvement of tissue perfusion in the perioperative period or to support weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Traditionally, perioperatively used inotropic agents, epinephrine, dobutamine, and milrinone, are limited by significant increases in myocardial oxygen consumption, proarrhythmia, or neurohormonal activation. Levosimendan, a new inodilator for the treatment of decompensated heart failure, has also shown promise in elective therapy of cardiac surgical patients with high perioperative risk or compromised left ventricular function, as well as in rescue therapy of patients with difficult weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. This review article briefly discusses the pharmacology of levosimendan and evaluates current best available evidence to assess the safety and efficacy of levosimendan usage in cardiac surgery.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^f0e228ad]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of cardiac function is crucial when deciding on whether inotropic agents have a place in the therapy of a given patient. Cardiac function may be altered when cardiac output is normal or even when elevated, as is often the case in myocardial depression in sepsis. In a trial involving more than 200 patients with septic shock, Vieillard-Baron et al. observed that several patients presented a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of close to 40 % even though their cardiac index was higher than 3 L/min/m 2. Conversely, several patients had a low cardiac output but preserved cardiac function—and inotropic stimulation should not be used in these patients. In 46 patients with septic shock, Bouferrache et al. observed that echocardiographic assessment of myocardial function and preload responsiveness often led to different interventions than those guided by the resuscitation goals proposed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). In this study, the authors found that agreement on the indication (or absence of indication) for inotropic administration occurred in 34 (74 %) of the patients, but that the evaluation of LVEF suggested the use of inotropic agents in 11 patients for whom the SSC guidelines suggested otherwise. The reverse situation occurred in only one patient. These authors therefore suggested that resuscitation should be guided by measurements of LVEF rather than by the SSC criteria. These data should, however, be interpreted with caution as no analysis of patient outcome was performed. The study simply illustrates that LVEF and oxygen saturation evaluate two different aspects of the hemodynamic state, with LVEF evaluating myocardial contractility and ScvO 2 evaluating the adequacy of cardiac output according to oxygen utilization. Hence, inotropic agents should be given only when the altered cardiac function is accompanied by a low or inadequate cardiac output and signs of tissue hypoperfusion are present. The aim of the therapeutic options mentioned above is to increase oxygen delivery (DO 2) to improve tissue perfusion. It therefore needs to be emphasized that the ultimate goal is the improvement of tissue perfusion—not the achievement of any specific DO 2 value, which ultimately could lead to patient’s harm.
We recommend early treatment, including hemodynamic stabilization (with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor treatment if needed) and treatment of the shock etiology. Best practice.
We suggest that inotropic agents should be added when the altered cardiac function is accompanied by a low or inadequate cardiac output and signs of tissue hypoperfusion persist after preload optimization. Recommendation. Level 2; QoE low (C).
We recommend not to give inotropes for isolated impaired cardiac function. Recommendation. Level 1; QoE moderate (B).
We recommend not to target absolute values of oxygen delivery in patients with shock. Recommendation. Level 1; QoE high (A).

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management-AAFP (...) [^c3910a51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

8 Previously, septic shock was identified by the presence of hypotension. It is now recognized that hypotension can be a late manifestation, and tissue hypoperfusion precedes hypotension. Lactate level, an indirect marker of tissue perfusion, has been incorporated in the diagnosis of septic shock in addition to the need for vasopressor therapy required to maintain mean arterial pressure of greater than 65 mm Hg. In this article, use of the term sepsis includes both sepsis and septic shock unless otherwise specified. 9, 12–14 Sepsis should be suspected in patients meeting at least two of the three qSOFA criteria: respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute or greater, altered mental status, and systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. These patients should undergo additional evaluation. The qSOFA is limited by its low sensitivity and because it typically identifies patients who present late in the course of sepsis.

Several individual trials showed no difference in 28-day mortality benefit between resuscitation using a colloid and a crystalloid; however, a subsequent meta-analysis suggested a marginal mortality benefit with the use of albumin. 26, 45–47 Despite these findings, crystalloids are recommended for fluid resuscitation because of availability and lower cost. Because of these concerns, there has been an increased interest in the use of balanced crystalloids. In a recent trial comparing balanced crystalloid with normal saline in critically ill adults, the balanced crystalloid led to marginal improvement in mortality and lower incidence of renal dysfunction. This trial, however, had a heterogenous population with sepsis as the admitting diagnosis in only 15% of patients.

Additional modalities can be used to determine fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness for assessment of optimal fluid management. These include ultrasonography to assess inferior vena cava collapsibility or distensibility, pulse pressure variation, and passive leg raise test.

### Levosimendan for postoperative subclinical heart failure after noncardiac surgery: a randomized, double-blinded, phase III trial [^c092ee39]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In the CHEETAH trial (Levosimendan for hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery) and the LICORN trial (Effect of Levosimendan on low cardiac output syndrome in patients with low ejection fraction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass) perioperative Troponin concentration was not affected by perioperative levosimendan administration,. Although we also did not observe any statistical significant differences in our study, Troponin T concentrations and MINS were noticeably higher in the levosimendan group. An explanation for these results could be the dosage of levosimendan in our trial. In contrast to the CHEETAH trial, in which an infusion dose of 0.05 mcg kg −1 min −1 was used, and the LICORN trial, in which an infusion dose of 0.1 mcg kg −1 min −1 was used, we administered levosimendan in the maximum dose of 0.2 mcg kg −1 min −1,. Thus, it seems likely that the administration of the maximum infusion rate of levosimendan resulted in a more marked myocardial oxygen-perfusion mismatch due to enhanced inotropy, which finally led to a higher Troponin T release.

Since the number of MINS was higher in the levosimendan group, we assumed a higher incidence of major cardiac complications. In contrast to previous studies, MINS was not significantly associated with 30-day cardiovascular complications in our post-hoc analysis,. A possible explanation might be that although the criteria for MINS were fulfilled, troponin T increase was relatively low, and thus not clinically meaningful. Interestingly, the incidence of major cardiovascular complications was 6% lower in the levosimendan group, but did not reach statistical significance. In this context, we also observed significantly lower NT-proBNP concentrations on the third and fifth postoperative day. This can be interpreted that pre-emptive levosimendan possibly improves myocardial function helping to compensate increased postoperative myocardial strain, which finally reduces the risk for major cardiovascular complications. Again, this was not statistically significant and must thus be interpreted as preliminary. To confirm this observation, a large, randomized trial is still necessary.

### Epinephrine, inodilator, or no inotrope in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantation: a single-center experience [^7a43d0ea]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the case of cardiogenic shock or in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, venoartrial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is employed for hemodynamic stabilization. Although randomized trials evaluating VA-ECMO in cardiogenic shock are still lacking, observational studies indicate beneficial effects on prognosis in patients with cardiogenic shock in acute heart failure with decreased myocardial function and in refractory cardiac arrest. Since a diseased myocardial function is common after cardiac arrest or in cardiogenic shock, a substantial amount of patients with VA-ECMO have decreased myocardial function.

VA-ECMO therapy by design leads to an increase in the afterload, which might have a negative effect on left ventricular (LV) performance and can increase LV and atrial filling pressures, pulmonary edema, LV distension, or even stasis in the pulmonary circulation. Because of lethal complications in case of clotting, stasis in pulmonary circulation and the left cardiac chambers has to be avoided. Inotropic therapy can increase LV performance and thereby overcome VA-ECMO-induced stasis.

Myocardial function after resuscitation and or myocardial infarction however is frequently depressed—a phenomenon which is coined as stunned or hibernating myocardium and may be reversible within the first days. If inotropes should be given to these patients (and if so, which agent) is discussed controversially in the literature. Arguments against inotropes are based on pathophysiology, with a disturbance of cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis which is critically involved in myocardial stunning. Clinically, the stunning is characterized by a decreased responsiveness of the contractile proteins to calcium and an excitation-contraction uncoupling defect. The calcium-sensitizing inotrope levosimendan, which has been approved for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure, might therefore be a potential therapeutic option to improve myocardial function in stunned myocardium. Regarding the use of levosimendan in patients with VA-ECMO, there are data suggesting levosimendan have beneficial outcome effects and positive effects on VA-ECMO weaning. Distelmaier et al. showed improved short-term and long-term survival in a retrospective registry of VA-ECMO parents with levosimendan treatment. In addition, patients treated with levosimendan were more successfully weaned from ECMO despite a more pronounced risk profile, which was reflected in a higher SAPS-3 and EuroSCORE. However, data on the effects of levosimendan therapy on survival are not consistent.

### Beneficial effects of levosimendan in infants with sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction: report of 2 cases [^68093a3b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Although international guidelines for hemodynamic support of pediatric septic shock suggest considering the potent calcium sensitizer inodilator levosimendan as a second-line inotropic agent to treat cold hypodynamic shock resistant to catecholamines, clinical experience in septic infants is lacking. We report the beneficial effects of levosimendan infusion in 2 infants (39 and 64 days old) with low cardiac output septic shock (ejection fraction, 29% and 33%; fractional shortening, 10% and 16% respectively) refractory to volume replacement and to the catecholamines dopamine and dobutamine. Levosimendan infusion (0.15 µg/kg/min) promptly increased both patients' myocardial contractility and improved tissue perfusion, thereby reducing lactate levels and increasing urine output. The only adverse effect was moderate hypotension in one infant, who reversed by adding norepinephrine to levosimendan. This clinical experience confirms the potential beneficial effects of levosimendan infusion to restore hemodynamics in infants with low cardiac output septic shock resistant to catecholamines.

### Role of levosimendan in the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage [^5795d568]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is one of the leading causes of neurologic disability accounting for dismal long term survival rates. aSAH leads to a sudden increase in intracranial pressure and a massive sympathetic discharge. Excessive sympathetic stimulation leads to catecholamine mediated myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic instability which may critically hamper brain perfusion and oxygenation. In the setting of acute aSAH, administration of vasoactive drugs aims at stabilizing impaired hemodynamics. However, studies have shown that conventional treatment with vasoactive drugs that lead to Ca(+2) overload and increase myocardial oxygen consumption, fail to restore hemodynamics and decrease cerebral blood flow. Levosimendan is a non-adrenergic inotropic Ca(+2) sensitizer with not only beneficial hemodynamic properties but also pleiotropic effects, contributing to its cardioprotective and neuroprotective role. Although there have been limited data available regarding the use of levosimendan in patients with aSAH, current evidence suggests that levosimendan may have a role in the setting of post-aSAH cardiomyopathy and decreased cerebral blood flow both in the emergency departments and in intensive care units. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of studies of levosimendan therapy for aSAH, and describe current knowledge about the effects of levosimendan in the management of aSAH.

### Combined milrinone and enteral metoprolol therapy in patients with septic myocardial depression [^2a29b060]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic cardiomyopathy refers to myocardial injury with or without lowered cardiac output in patients with sepsis. In contrast to earlier beliefs concerning the frequency of septic cardiomyopathy, a recent prospective trial in 67 adult septic shock patients without previous cardiac disease reported an overall hypokinesia rate (left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45%) of 60%. As compared with patients able to maintain hyperdynamic circulation, survival is significantly compromised in septic shock patients with low systemic blood flow. Even if cardiac output can be preserved, myocardial injury as indicated by increased plasma levels of troponin or natriuretic peptides [-] is associated with poor outcome in septic shock.

The etiology of septic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial. Throughout the last decades, several pathogenetic mechanisms, including bacterial toxins, cytokines, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species, were identified. Recently, the contributory role of adrenergic stress and catecholamine-induced toxicity has been suggested. Similarities have been drawn between catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning and septic cardiomyopathy. Sepsis was found to be an important risk factor for development of the left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, originally known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

In view of the growing evidence for an association between beta adrenergic stress and the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy, the administration of beta-blocking agents could be beneficial. Although at first glance it appears counterproductive to administer a potentially negative inotropic drug to a patient with myocardial depression, beta-blocker therapy improved myocardial oxygen utilization, decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, and preserved cardiac function in a septic animal model. Similarly, Gore and Wolfe found that a continuous esmolol infusion reduced heart rate by 20% but did not compromise systemic oxygen delivery or organ blood flow in six hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis.

Apart from these studies, an increasing number of reports have been published suggesting advantageous effects of beta blockers in acute critical illness. Though recently challenged, perioperative beta blockade has repeatedly been shown to reduce cardiac complications and improve survival in high-risk surgery patients. Similarly, preliminary data on the use of beta blockers in critically ill patients with severe trauma, traumatic brain injury, or burns indicate a beneficial influence on morbidity and mortality.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^f40272cb]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

In critically ill patients, many mechanisms are likely responsible for the release of troponin into the systemic circulation, including impaired microvascular perfusion, reduced oxygen delivery to the heart, myocardial depression and cellular injury, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Although cardiac troponins are sensitive and relatively specific biomarkers of myocardial injury, elevations are not diagnostically specific for acute coronary syndrome, and can occur in the absence of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Cardiac troponin elevation may be even less specific in critically ill patients, as many conditions are associated with increased troponin, including infection, sepsis, septic shock, hypotension, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, and renal insufficiency. Troponin levels are frequently elevated in critically ill patients and are independently positively associated with short- and long-term mortality [-]. In a systematic review, 43% of 3278 critically ill patients enrolled in 20 studies had elevated troponin levels. In adjusted analyses, elevated troponin was associated with an increased risk of death (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.9 to 3.4; P < 0.001); in unadjusted analyses, it was associated with increased length of ICU stay of 3 days (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.1 days; P = 0.004) and hospital stay of 2.2 days (95% CI, -0.6 to 4.9 days; P = 0.12).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^4211b463]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock with cardiac dysfunction—inodilators (Recommendation 33): We were unable to issue a recommendation about adding an inodilator in children with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction despite other vasoactive agents; however, in our practice, we sometimes use inodilators in children with septic shock and evidence of persistent hypoperfusion and cardiac dysfunction despite other vasoactive agents. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of inodilators (including milrinone, dobutamine, or levosimendan) in this setting; limited reports include a report of two children with improved cardiac output after inodilators and a case series of 10 children with meningococcal septic shock treated with milrinone describing improved core-to-peripheral temperature gradient, stable blood pressure, and no change in acidosis. In practice reporting, 77% of panel members at least sometimes used inodilators in this scenario, typically in a PICU with advanced hemodynamic monitoring available.

### Vasopressors and inotropes in sepsis [^5e6a17d2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor and inotropes are beneficial in shock states. Norepinephrine is considered the first-line vasopressor for patients with sepsis-associated hypotension. Dobutamine is considered the first-line inotrope in sepsis, and should be considered for patients with evidence of myocardial dysfunction or ongoing signs of hypoperfusion. Vasopressor and inotrope therapy has complex effects that are often difficult to predict; emergency providers should consider the physiology and clinical trial data. It is essential to continually reevaluate the patient to determine if the selected treatment is having the intended result.

### Down but not out: myocardial depression in sepsis [^2c959f59]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Myocardial depression in septic patients is well recognized yet still poorly understood. The prognostic significance in terms of overall mortality when it is identified, remains in dispute. Parameters of left ventricular function measured by tissue Doppler imaging may assist in resolving whether dysfunction identified early in the course of sepsis is a good prognostic sign.

### Comparative efficacy of vasoactive medications in patients with septic shock: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1c94c952]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 601 studies from electronic databases were identified, and 166 duplicated studies were removed. After an initial evaluation of the titles and abstracts, 365 studies were excluded because they did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria. The remaining 70 studies were identified for full review, and 27 studies were excluded due to inappropriate study design, lack of outcomes of interest to review, and other reasons. Eventually, 43 randomized controlled trials with 5767 septic shock patients were included. The included studies were presented in Additional file 1. The flow diagram for the study inclusion according to PRISMA is shown in Fig. 1. These trials were conducted in 17 different countries, with Italy contributing the most (7 trials, 16.3%). The studies were published in English or Chinese. A total of 17 different interventions were identified in papers published between 1993 and 2017. The designs of the included RCTs were presented in Table 1.

Studies designs of included randomized controlled trials

The detailed management description and baseline characteristics of these trials were presented in Additional file 1. Norepinephrine was used most frequently in 23 trials. Vasopressin and levosimendan were both used in 9 trials. Dobutamine and dopamine were used in 7 and 6 trials, respectively, and epinephrine was used in 4 trials, while enoximone, pituitrin, and selepressin were all used in 1 trial. The combination of norepinephrine and dopamine was used in 4 trials, while the combinations of vasopressin and norepinephrine, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and terlipressin, dobutamine, and norepinephrine were used in 1 trial.

Risk of bias

As shown in Fig. 2, the most common risk was blinding of participants and personnel almost with one fourth of trials considered to be at high risk for bias. This was probably explained by the difficulty of blinding personnel who were performing 1 or more different medications in each patient. The lowest risk was random sequence generation, with exceeding 80% of trials considered to be at low risk for bias. The risk for random sequence generation, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias was considered to be at high risk in non-trials. The details for the risk of bias were presented in (Additional file 1 : Table S2). In summary, 24 trials were considered to be at low risk, and 14 trials were considered to be at unclear risk, while 5 trials were considered to be at high risk.

### Levosimendan treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4cc7490]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Emerging studies suggest that administration of levosimendan therapy may be better than dobutamine or placebo in decompensated heart failure. The authors performed an updated meta-analysis of trials to obtain the best estimates of the efficacy and safety of levosimendan for the initial treatment of decompensated heart failure.

Design

A meta-analysis.

Setting

Hospitals.

Participants

A total of 5,349 patients from 25 randomized controlled studies were included in the analysis.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The authors performed a meta-analysis of trials comparing levosimendan therapy with dobutamine or placebo in patients with decompensated heart failure. Twenty-five trials, involving 5,349 patients, were included. Two reviewers performed independent article review and study quality assessment. Data on overall mortality, early-term mortality, midterm mortality, long-term mortality, efficacy outcomes, and adverse events were collected. Mortality outcomes were according to follow-up duration: early term (≤30-day), midterm (30-day to≤6-month), and long term (>6-month). Levosimendan was compared with dobutamine or placebo, calculating pooled relatives risk (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was selected for meta-analysis if there was significant heterogeneity. Levosimendan significantly reduced total mortality (17.1% versus 20.8%; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94). Compared with dobutamine, levosimendan was associated with significant reduction in mortality at final follow-up (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97; I(2) = 7%; p = 0.02).Compared with placebo, levosimendan was associated with a nonsignificant trend in favor of placebo in mortality at final follow-up (11.6% versus 16.2%, RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-1.01; p = 0.06), but it was associated with a significant reduction in long-term mortality (RR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.15-0.76; p = 0.009). Compared with dobutamine or placebo, levosimendan therapy was associated with improvements in hemodynamically- and echocardiographically-derived cardiac parameters. Levosimendan therapy increased the risks of extrasystoles (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.26-2.81), hypotension (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.53), and headache or migraine (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.54-2.43) when compared with control therapy.

Conclusions

As compared to placebo or dobutamine, levosimendan in patients with heart failure seemed to have hemodynamic and cardiac benefits. It reduced total mortality and was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

### Effects of levosimendan, a novel inotropic calcium-sensitizing drug, in experimental septic shock [^0384a532]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Levosimendan is a novel inodilator that improves cardiac contractility by sensitizing troponin C to calcium. This drug has proved to be effective in treating advanced congestive heart failure but has not been evaluated in septic settings. The purpose of the present study was to study the effects of this drug in a porcine model of endotoxemia.

Design

Prospective experimental study.

Subjects

Fourteen landrace pigs.

Interventions

All animals were anesthetized and catheterized for measurement of central and pulmonary hemodynamics. Ultrasonic flow probes were placed around the renal artery and portal vein to measure blood flow. A tonometer was placed in the ileum to measure mucosal pH. Levosimendan was given to six animals as a bolus (200 microg x kg(-1)) followed by a continuous infusion (200 microg x kg(-1) x hr(-1)). Thirty minutes after onset of levosimendan treatment, all animals received endotoxin (20 microg x kg(-1) x hr(-1) for 3 hrs).

Measurements and Main Results

At baseline, levosimendan induced a systemic vasodilation with a reduction in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. A tendency to an increase in cardiac index did not reach statistical significance (p =.055). Cardiac index and systemic oxygen delivery were markedly improved in the levosimendan group during endotoxemia. Systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure were reduced in the levosimendan group. The latter parameter, however, was only different from the control group during the initial phase of endotoxin shock but not at the late, most pronounced phase of shock. Levosimendan also efficiently attenuated endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension. Portal venous blood flow and gut oxygen delivery were improved, but no concomitant reduction in endotoxin-induced intestinal mucosal acidosis was observed. Renal blood flow was unaffected, as was the endotoxin-induced increase in plasma endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity. These findings support previous reports of calcium desensitization as a potential component in septic myocardial depression. Furthermore, the vasodilatory properties of this drug were well tolerated in the current model of hypodynamic endotoxin shock, and they may have contributed to improved regional blood flow as seen in the gut as well as improved systemic perfusion by means of reduced biventricular afterload.

Conclusion

Pretreatment with levosimendan in pigs subjected to endotoxin shock improved cardiac output and systemic and gut oxygen delivery. In addition, pulmonary hypertension largely was attenuated without any adverse effects on gas exchange. These results are promising in several aspects, but the role of levosimendan in the treating circulatory failure in sepsis remains to be established.

### Levosimendan for hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery [^a5d64f7b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study CHEETAH was published by Giovanni Landoni and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac surgery. In the CHEETAH study, the trial question was: what is the effect of levosimendan in patients who required perioperative hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery? In the CHEETAH study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHEETAH study, the population was: 506 patients (179 female, 327 male). The inclusion criteria were patients requiring perioperative hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery. The key exclusion criteria were previous adverse response to levosimendan; receipt of levosimendan in the previous 30 days; receipt of a kidney or liver transplant; liver cirrhosis; receipt of ECMO; DNR order. In the CHEETAH study, the interventions were: n=248 levosimendan (continuous infusion at a dose of 0.025-0.2 mcg/kg/min plus standard care) n=258 placebo (infusion of a mixed-vitamins solution with a yellow color, devoid of relevant cardiovascular effects, plus standard care). In the CHEETAH study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 30 (12.9% vs. 12.8%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -5.7 to 5.9). In the CHEETAH study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (19 hours vs. 21 hours; AD -2 hours, 95% CI -5 to 1) No significant difference in length of ICU stay (72 hours vs. 84 hours; AD -12 hours, 95% CI -21 to 2) No significant difference in length of hospital stay (14 days vs. 14 days; ). In the CHEETAH study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. In the CHEETAH study, the conclusion was: in patients requiring perioperative hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery, levosimendan was not superior to placebo with respect to death at day 30.

Since baseline data varied (non-significantly) among groups, relative changes from baseline were calculated and compared between groups. Relative increases from baseline of MFIs, MFIm, PPV, and PVD (that is, dMFIs, dMFIm, dPPV, and dPVD) were significantly higher in the levosimendan group (Figure 3 and 4). In addition, the heterogeneity index decreased relative to baseline only in the levosimendan group. Correlation analyses (that is, DO 2 I and CI versus MFIm and MFIs in each group) revealed no statistically significant results (each P > 0.05; Figure 5).

### Safety of levosimendan in pediatric patients: an up-to-date systematic review [^1c81471f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The potential risks associated with the use of levosimendan in the pediatric population has not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to review the available evidence regarding the safety of this treatment.

Methods

Bio Med Central, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials were searched for studies describing levosimendan administration in the pediatric population in any setting. Relevant studies were independently screened, selected, and their data extracted by two investigators. The authors excluded: reviews, meta-analyses, as well as basic research and trials involving patients >18 years old. The primary outcome was the number and the type of adverse side effects reported during levosimendan administration.

Results

The updated systematic review included 48 studies, enrolling a total of 1,271 pediatric patients who received levosimendan as treatment (790 patients in the 11 studies that reported side effects). The primary adverse effects of levosimendan administration were hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly tachycardia. Hypotension occurred in approximately 28.9% of patients, while arrhythmia occurred in about 12.3% of patients. Meta analysis of RCTs revealed a rate of all-cause mortality of 2.0% (8 out of 385) in the levosimendan group compared to 3.9% (15 out of 378) in the control group (dobutamine, milrinone or placebo) (risk ratio [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-1.21; P = 0.14; I 2 = 0%) CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia are the most reported side effects of levosimendan in pediatric patients. However, adverse events remain underreported, especially in randomized trials.

### Effects of levosimendan on right ventricular afterload in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pilot study [^96500096]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is frequently associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and thus with systolic load of the right ventricle. We hypothesized that levosimendan, a new calcium sensitizer with potential pulmonary vasodilator properties, improves hemodynamics by unloading the right ventricle in patients with ARDS.

Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study.

Setting

Twenty-two-bed multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Thirty-five patients with ARDS in association with septic shock.

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to receive a 24-hr infusion of either levosimendan 0.2 microg/kg/min (n = 18) or placebo (n = 17). Data from right heart catheterization, cardiac magnetic resonance, arterial and mixed venous oxygen tensions and saturations, and carbon dioxide tensions were obtained before and 24 hrs after drug infusion.

Measurements and Main Results

At a mean arterial pressure between 70 and 80 mm Hg (sustained with norepinephrine infusion), levosimendan increased cardiac index (from 3.8 +/- 1.1 to 4.2 +/- 1.0 L/min/m) and decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (from 29 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (from 290 +/- 77 to 213 +/- 50 dynes/s/cm(5)/m(2); each p < .05). Levosimendan also decreased right ventricular end-systolic volume and increased right ventricular ejection fraction (p < .05). In addition, levosimendan increased mixed venous oxygen saturation (from 63 +/- 8 to 70 +/- 8%; p < .01).

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that levosimendan improves right ventricular performance through pulmonary vasodilator effects in septic patients with ARDS. A large multiple-center trial is needed to investigate whether levosimendan is able to improve the overall prognosis of patients with sepsis and ARDS.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^e149caf3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Although guidelines provide excellent expert guidance for managing patients with septic shock, they leave room for personalization according to patients' condition. Hemodynamic monitoring depends on the evolution phase: salvage, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation. Initially during the salvage phase, monitoring to identify shock etiology and severity should include arterial pressure and lactate measurements together with clinical examination, particularly skin mottling and capillary refill time. Low diastolic blood pressure may trigger vasopressor initiation. At this stage, echocardiography may be useful to identify significant cardiac dysfunction. During the optimization phase, echocardiographic monitoring should be pursued and completed by the assessment of tissue perfusion through central or mixed-venous oxygen saturation, lactate, and carbon dioxide veno-arterial gradient. Transpulmonary thermodilution and the pulmonary artery catheter should be considered in the most severe patients. Fluid therapy also depends on shock phases. While administered liberally during the resuscitation phase, fluid responsiveness should be assessed during the optimization phase. During stabilization, fluid infusion should be minimized. In the de-escalation phase, safe fluid withdrawal could be achieved by ensuring tissue perfusion is preserved. Norepinephrine is recommended as first-line vasopressor therapy, while vasopressin may be preferred in some patients. Essential questions remain regarding optimal vasopressor selection, combination therapy, and the most effective and safest escalation. Serum renin and the angiotensin I/II ratio may identify patients who benefit most from angiotensin II. The optimal therapeutic strategy for shock requiring high-dose vasopressors is scant. In all cases, vasopressor therapy should be individualized, based on clinical evaluation and blood flow measurements to avoid excessive vasoconstriction. Inotropes should be considered in patients with decreased cardiac contractility associated with impaired tissue perfusion. Based on pharmacologic properties, we suggest as the first test a limited dose of dobutamine, to add enoximone or milrinone in the second line and substitute or add levosimendan if inefficient. Regarding adjunctive therapies, while hydrocortisone is nowadays advised in patients receiving high doses of vasopressors, patients responding to corticosteroids may be identified in the future by the analysis of selected cytokines or specific transcriptomic endotypes. To conclude, although some general rules apply for shock management, a personalized approach should be considered for hemodynamic monitoring and support.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to patients with pulmonary hypertension, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering inodilators (dobutamine, milrinone, levosimendan) to increase cardiac output and lower pulmonary vascular resistance in the perioperative period according to the patient's hemodynamic status.

### Differential effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on glomerular filtration rate in patients with heart failure and renal impairment: a Randomized double-blind controlled trial [^79d0e132]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects more than 26 million people worldwide and is a leading reason for hospitalization in Europe and the United States. 1 Cardiorenal syndrome, a condition in which renal impairment occurs as a result of cardiac dysfunction, is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death. 2, 3 Indeed, renal dysfunction is a stronger predictor of mortality than New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class or left ventricular ejection fraction. 4

The use of inotropes in decompensated HF is considered an option for selected patients with severe reduction of cardiac output and compromised perfusion of vital organs, such as the kidneys. 5 The drugs most commonly used are dopamine, dobutamine, and milrinone and, outside the United States, levosimendan. All of these agents increase cardiac output; however, their effect on the cardiorenal syndrome is less well studied, and whether differences occur between agents is uncertain.

Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer and an opener of ATP‐dependent potassium channels that has inotropic and arterial and venous dilating properties. 6 Levosimendan has been suggested to have renoprotective properties in several settings, such as cardiac surgery, 7 heart transplantation, 8 sepsis, 9 and HF. The LIDO (Levosimendan Infusion versus Dobutamine) Study, which examined inotropic treatment among those with low‐output HF, showed that levosimendan brought about a significant decrease in serum creatinine compared with dobutamine. 10 Subsequent studies have suggested that levosimendan has a beneficial effect on renal function among people with acute and chronic HF. 11, 12, 13 Bragadottir et al found that levosimendan, when compared with placebo, increased both renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in post–cardiac surgery patients with normal preoperative serum creatinine. 14 Still, there is a paucity of data on the effect of inotropic agents on RBF and GFR in individuals with HF and cardiorenal syndrome.

We examined the effects of levosimendan, compared with dobutamine, on RBF, GFR, and renal oxygenation in patients with chronic HF and impaired renal function in a randomized double‐blind controlled study. Our hypothesis was that levosimendan would increase GFR to a greater extent than dobutamine would.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^7cf1f819]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Although we found a similarly high prevalence of elevated troponin (approximately 30% to 35% of patients) in our study of patients who had septic shock, we did not find that increased troponin was associated with increased mortality. Published data regarding the prognostic value of troponin elevation in patients with sepsis syndrome are conflicting [-]. However, consistent with our results, most studies have not found that troponin elevation is an independent predictor of mortality, after adjusting for other variables [,-]. In multivariate analyses, previous trials have identified greater severity of illness and the presence of shock as independent predictors of death, as we did in our study [,-]. In contrast, whereas several small studies found increased mortality in patients with sepsis who have elevated troponin levels [-], only one study concluded that elevated cTnI was an independent prognosticator of mortality after adjusting for other significant variables (OR, 2.020; 95% CI, 1.153 to 3.541; P = 0.014). It is not clear whether elevated troponin is not prognostic in septic shock, or whether patient heterogeneity, or differences in timing and frequency of troponin measurement in different studies, accounts for these conflicting results.

ECGs are used in addition to serum cardiac biomarkers to diagnose cardiac ischemia in critically ill patients who are unable to communicate symptoms. However, ECG findings suggestive of ischemia, such as ST-segment deviations, are common in critically ill patients and may be nonspecific for diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia. In our study, 48% of patients with septic shock had possible or probable ECG ischemia; however, this was not prognostic of worse clinical outcomes, even with concomitant troponin elevation. Our prevalence rate of 48% is generally consistent with that of other relevant studies. Landesberg and colleagues monitored continuous 12-lead ECGs in 101 general ICU patients with known coronary artery disease, or two or more risk factors for coronary artery disease. Of these patients, 21% had ischemic ST-segment changes, characterized in most by ST depression. Similarly, Kress and colleagues observed ST-segment elevation or depression on continuous three-lead Holter monitoring in 24% of critically ill patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease, which was associated with a longer ICU stay. In a prospective trial evaluating myocardial ischemia during mechanical ventilation and weaning, Frazier and colleagues observed ST-segment changes in 70% of 43 patients, and these patients were 60% more likely to fail an initial weaning trial.

### Hemodynamic effects of levosimendan added to dobutamine in patients with decompensated advanced heart failure refractory to dobutamine alone [^1db61396]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

A 24-hour infusion of levosimendan was added to dobutamine in 18 patients (aged 63 +/- 9 years) hospitalized for management of decompensated New York Heart Association functional class IV heart failure refractory to a continuous 24-hour infusion of dobutamine (10 microg/kg/min) and furosemide (10 mg/hour); the primary study end point was a >or=40% increase in cardiac index and a >or=25% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared with pretreatment measurements. The primary end point was reached in one of the patients treated with dobutamine alone versus 7 patients (39%) treated with levosimendan and dobutamine combined (p = 0.008), whereas at 24 hours, the combined treatment was associated with a 0.76 +/- 0.78 L/min/m(2) (p = 0.001) mean increase in cardiac index and a 6.4 +/- 7.3 mm Hg (p = 0.002) mean decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared with measurements obtained after 24 hours of dobutamine infusion alone. Symptoms were alleviated in all patients, and all but 3 were discharged from the hospital.

### Clinical efficacy and hemodynamic effects of levosimendan in cardiac surgery patients after surgery [^875ae300]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cardiac surgery patients often present in a critical condition, with disease progression occurring rapidly and necessitating prompt surgical intervention. During such surgeries, the heart endures prolonged ischemia and reperfusion injury, which can impair cardiac contraction and relaxation, leading to acute heart failure. This condition manifests clinically as dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, chest congestion, shortness of breath, decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and arrhythmias, all of which adversely affect patient prognosis. Effective monitoring of cardiac function is crucial in critically ill patients undergoing cardiac surgery to prevent and manage acute heart failure early.

Current treatment strategies for acute heart failure predominantly involve the use of positive inotropic drugs such as dopamine, dobutamine, and epinephrine, which significantly enhance cardiac function. These drugs work by stimulating β -receptors, leading to increased myocardial contractility, vasodilation, and reduced peripheral resistance. Dopamine and dobutamine improve hemodynamics by dilating renal, coronary, and cerebral vessels. Adrenaline, through α and β receptor stimulation, enhances coronary vessel dilation and improves heart function (Lympelopoulos et al. 2021). However, the increased myocardial contractility associated with these agents can result in calcium imbalance, elevated intracellular calcium levels, reduced tissue ATP, increased cardiac oxygen consumption, and a higher risk of arrhythmias and myocardial damage, which can exacerbate the condition and elevate patient mortality.

Levosimendan, a newer cardiac stimulant, offers a promising alternative. It enhances myocardial contractility by sensitizing cardiac myofilaments to calcium, without increasing intracellular calcium levels, thus minimizing the risk of arrhythmias and myocardial oxygen consumption. Additionally, levosimendan improves ventricular diastolic function and reduces cardiac stress by its vasodilatory effects, which collectively contribute to better management of acute heart failure.

In our study, patients treated with levosimendan exhibited significant improvements in hemodynamic parameters, including decreased central venous pressure, heart rate, and lactic acid levels, and increased systolic blood pressure and urine output. This suggests that levosimendan enhances cardiac function by promoting effective Ca2 + binding to troponin C, thereby improving myocardial contraction and overall hemodynamic stability. Additionally, we observed improvements in left ventricular function, with increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVi). These changes indicate enhanced cardiac contractile function and reduced ventricular stress.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^ecf16eb5]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac ischemia occurs frequently in critically ill patients and is associated with increased mortality. Given that most critically ill patients cannot communicate symptoms, the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia can be challenging and necessitates that clinicians rely on cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Patients receiving vasopressors may be at even higher risk of cardiac ischemia than other patients because of coronary artery vasoconstriction, increased systemic vasoconstriction-induced afterload, or catecholamine-driven increases in myocardial oxygen demand.

The Vasopressin in Severe Sepsis Trial (VASST) randomized patients with septic shock to vasopressin or norepinephrine. Overall, no significant difference occurred in the primary outcome (28-day mortality) between the vasopressin and the norepinephrine groups (35.4% versus 39.3%, respectively; P = 0.26). Further, no differences were found in the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction/ischemia in the two groups (2.0% versus 1.8%; P = 1.0), or in the incidence of cardiac arrest, tachyarrhythmias, or bradyarrhythmias. Vasopressin and norepinephrine are both potent vasoconstrictors, and animal studies suggest that vasopressin is associated with coronary vasoconstriction and myocardial depression. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to examine, in more detail, ischemic ECG changes, troponin and creatine kinase (CK) levels, and clinical outcomes in a subset of patients enrolled in the VASST Trial. Our specific objectives were to describe troponin and CK levels and ECG abnormalities in patients with severe septic shock and to compare the effect of vasopressin versus that of norepinephrine on troponin and CK levels, ECGs, and the clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

### The effects of levosimendan and dobutamine in experimental bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity [^bc3c2d54]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study have demonstrated that both levosimendan and dobutamine prolong the time for cardiac arrest development after bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity.

Deleterious effects of accidental intravenous administration of bupivacaine leading to severe cardiovascular collapse and shock are well documented [-]. Various agents have been evaluated for alleviating the cardiotoxic effects of bupivacaine in both animal studies and human case series. Experimental treatment protocols have included amrinone, isoprotrenol, insulin, clonidine, adrenalin, and phenylephrine. Currently only dobutamine and lipid infusion are generally recommended [-]. Despite all resuscitative efforts with dobutamine and lipid infusion treatment, accidental intravenous bupivacaine exposure can be fatal, and newer treatment options may prove helpful.

Levosimendan has proven beneficial effects on cardiac dysfunction following cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, cardiac resuscitation, or sepsis [-]. Despite its growing use in cardiac failure patients, levosimendan was evaluated in only two previous animal studies for treating experimental cardiotoxicity caused by local anesthetic agents. In one study with ropivacaine, a levosimendan infusion caused a marked improvement in heart rate, as well as generated pressure and cardiac output, compared with a normal saline infusion in isolated pig hearts. These promising results led to another study involving anesthetized pigs that evaluated the effect of levosimendan on bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. In this randomized study, 20 pigs received a bupivacaine infusion at a dose of 2 mg/kg/min until a 55% decrease in mean arterial pressure. The study group received 80 μg/kg levosimendan for 10 min followed by an infusion of 0.7 μg/kg/min. Although cardiac output, ejection fraction, and stroke power/end-diastolic volume measurements showed rapid improvement with levosimendan, there was no time-group effect difference in overall recovery and mortality. Heart rate was significantly higher in the levosimendan group, and this was interpreted as a possible sign of improved recovery with levosimendan.

heart. However, it is increasingly being recognised that these drugs have important side effects and may even be associated with harm.

It has been extensively studied in patients with heart failure and is a licensed drug for this group of patients in many. European countries and elsewhere around the world. Around half of patients with septic shock may develop impaired heart function and associated kidney failure, and levosimendan has been shown to improve this.

### Adrenergic downregulation in critical care: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic evidence [^75c941ac]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Catecholamines remain the mainstay of therapy for acute cardiovascular dysfunction. However, adrenergic receptors quickly undergo desensitization and downregulation after prolonged stimulation. Moreover, prolonged exposure to high circulating catecholamines levels is associated with several adverse effects on different organ systems. Unfortunately, in critically ill patients, adrenergic downregulation translates into progressive reduction of cardiovascular response to exogenous catecholamine administration, leading to refractory shock. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in recent years toward use of noncatecholaminergic inotropes and vasopressors. Several studies investigating a wide variety of catecholamine-sparing strategies (eg, levosimendan, vasopressin, β-blockers, steroids, and use of mechanical circulatory support) have been published recently. Use of these agents was associated with improvement in hemodynamics and decreased catecholamine use but without a clear beneficial effect on major clinical outcomes. Accordingly, additional research is needed to define the optimal management of catecholamine-resistant shock.

### New drugs for acute kidney injury [^57c93dcd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamics and oxygen delivery

Angiotensin 2 (AngII), an endogenous vasoconstrictor, preferentially constricts the glomerular efferent arteriole, thus increasing glomerular filtration rate. A post-hoc analysis of the ATHOS-3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that patients with vasodilatory shock on renal replacement therapy (RRT) discontinued RRT earlier (38% vs 15% by day 7, p = 0.007) and had a lower 28-day mortality (30% vs 53%, p = 0.012) if randomized to AngII compared to placebo. Confirmation is sought in the ASK-IT trial (NCT00711789). Small trials suggested that vasopressin might improve renal function, however, vasopressin and also the selective vasopressin V1a receptor agonist selepressin did not show a difference in the need for renal replacement therapy compared to norepinephrine in larger trials. The putative nephroprotective effects of levosimendan, an inodilator, may be mediated by improved cardiac function, or by glomerular afferent arteriolar vasodilation. A meta-analysis of 13 trials in cardiac surgery patients showed that levosimendan reduced the incidence of postoperative AKI [odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–0.76; p = 0.001] and use of RRT (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.76, p = 0.002). Further results are awaited [e.g. the LEVOAKI trial (NCT02531724)]. In patients requiring vasopressor support, the optimal blood pressure target is unknown. Whilst a higher blood pressure target was associated with less RRT use in septic shock patients with known hypertension (32% vs 42%, p = 0.046), there was no difference in mortality.

### Levosimendan as a rescue drug in experimental propranolol-induced myocardial depression: a randomized study [^a4ed6da2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Severe beta-blocker intoxication remains a clinical challenge despite a variety of treatment options. Because of its unique mechanism of action, the new calcium sensitizer levosimendan may provide more prominent cardiac support compared with current medications used to reverse negative inotropy. We hypothesize that levosimendan could reverse propranolol-induced severe negative inotropy in a porcine model of beta-blocker intoxication.

Methods

Twenty-four pigs were anesthetized and monitored. After severe propranolol intoxication was completed, animals were randomized into 3 groups. With a double-blind procedure, 9 animals received a 1.25-mg levosimendan bolus, followed by saline solution infusion, 9 animals received mean arterial pressure-targeted dobutamine infusion after saline solution bolus, and 6 animals received a saline solution bolus followed by saline solution infusion. Hemodynamic and laboratory data were collected during a follow-up period of 120 minutes.

Results

All 9 pigs in the levosimendan group survived. In contrast, 4 of 6 (67%) and 7 of 9 (78%) pigs died during the experiment in the placebo and the dobutamine groups, respectively. The levosimendan group showed improved change in the maximum positive slope of the left ventricular pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and mean arterial pressure compared with the dobutamine and the placebo groups.

Conclusion

Levosimendan improved hemodynamic function and survival in this animal model of severe propranolol intoxication. The potential clinical application of levosimendan in propranolol intoxication warrants further investigation.

### Effect of levosimendan on prognosis in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7e7f95ad]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative AKI is a common complication in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Some studies have reported that levosimendan therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with lower renal replacement therapy and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. However, controversial or negative results on the effect of levosimendan have been reported. Our analysis showed a significant reduction in the risk of renal replacement therapy with levosimendan therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition, we also found that levosimendan therapy reduced mechanical ventilation duration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Subgroup analysis indicated that these benefits were confined to low-EF studies. Levosimendan might improve renal function in cardiac surgery due to its ability to improve cardiac systolic function and systemic hemodynamics. In acute decompensated heart failure, levosimendan has an immediate renoprotective effect, which is mediated by an increase in renal blood flow resulting from selective renal arterial and venous vasodilating action. One study also indicated that levosimendan therapy induced vasodilation, preferentially of preglomerular resistance vessels, thereby increasing both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate without jeopardizing renal oxygenation after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

The improvement in cardiac systolic function induced by levosimendan is due to two mechanisms – vasodilation and increased contractility. In this meta-analysis, postoperative hypotension was documented in four trials (1600 patients). Pooled analysis showed no association between levosimendan and postoperative hypotension. A possible reason for this may be that the reduction in systemic vascular resistance is compensated for by an increased cardiac index. Since most of these hypotension episodes often occurred following the administration of a loading dose, hypotension may be avoided by eliminating the loading dose while the favorable hemodynamic effects of levosimendan can be obtained through continuous infusion.

With regard to other adverse effects, postoperative arterial fibrillation was also observed. Our analysis showed that levosimendan therapy did not increase the incidence of postoperative arterial fibrillation. However, levosimendan use significantly increased the incidence of hypotension in patients with preoperative ventricular systolic dysfunction. Although levosimendan can be considered to be a well-tolerated agent that can provide an important treatment option for cardiac systolic dysfunction following cardiac surgery, levosimendan should be used with caution in patients with hemodynamic instability.

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis, heart rate control with short-acting betablockers did not reduce mortality in septic patients. Underlying mechanisms should be further evaluated in future studies. These need to provide extensive data on hemodynamic monitoring, cardiac function, and individual patient data to support an individualized approach in order to identify patients that may benefit from this therapeutic regimen.

### Effect of levosimendan treatment in pediatric patients with cardiac dysfunction: an update of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f0b57983]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Levosimendan increasingly has been used to treat heart failure and cardiac dysfunction in pediatric patients. Currently, there is only limited evidence that this drug positively affects outcomes. The authors' aim was to investigate the effects of levosimendan on hemodynamic parameters and outcomes in pediatric patients in all clinical settings. The study design was a systematic review of randomized and nonrandomized studies. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included in a meta-analysis. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the effect of levosimendan on central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) and lactate values as surrogate markers of low-cardiac-output syndrome. The study setting was any acute care setting. Study participants were pediatric patients (age <18 years) receiving levosimendan, and the intervention was levosimendan versus any control treatment. The authors identified 44 studies published from 2004 to 2020, including a total of 1,131 pediatric patients. Nine studies (enrolling 547 patients) were RCTs, all performed in a pediatric cardiac surgery setting. Three RCTs were judged to carry a low risk of bias. In the RCTs, levosimendan administration was associated with a significant improvement of ScvO 2 (p = 0.03) and a trend toward lower postoperative lactate levels (p = 0.08). No differences could be found for secondary outcomes. Levosimendan use in pediatric patients is not associated with major side effects and may lead to hemodynamic improvement after cardiac surgery. However, its impact on major clinical outcomes remains to be determined. Overall, the quality of evidence for levosimendan use in pediatric patients is low, and further high-quality RCTs are needed.

Inotropes evidence and cautions in septic shock—Dobutamine and epinephrine are the most commonly used inotropes, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared dobutamine to placebo and mortality effects are unclear, so the panel issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations and both should be discontinued if ineffective or harmful. Indirect comparison from network meta-analysis showed that dobutamine with norepinephrine had no clear impact on mortality compared to no inotropic agents (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47). In an observational study of 420 patients with septic shock, inotrope use was independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94). No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine, and an indirect comparison showed no clear effect on mortality (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47–3.97). Dobutamine infusion may produce severe vasodilation and result in lower MAP, and the inotropic response may be blunted in sepsis with a preserved chronotropic effect causing tachycardia without an increase in stroke volume. The panel considered the network meta-analysis as a higher quality than observational studies and issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations, and both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse events.

### Levosimendan for resuscitating the microcirculation in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled study [^46fd9859]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Microvascular network

Microvascular blood flow was visualized by means of an SDF imaging device (MicroScan ® ; MicroVision Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a 5× magnification lens. The optical probe was applied to the sublingual mucosa after gentle removal of saliva with a gauze swab. Three discrete fields were captured with precaution to minimize motion artifacts. Individual sequences of approximately 15 seconds were analyzed off-line with the aid of dedicated software (Automated Vascular Analysis 3.0; Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in a randomized fashion by a single investigator who was unaware of the study protocol. Vessel density was automatically calculated from the software as the total vessel lengths of the small, medium, and large vessels, divided by the total area of the image. The 'De Backer score' was calculated as described previously and is based on the principle that density of the vessels is proportional to the number of vessels crossing arbitrary lines. In this score, three equidistant horizontal lines and three equidistant vertical lines are drawn on the screen, and then the De Backer score can be calculated as the number of small, medium, and large vessels crossing the lines, divided by the total length of the lines. Vessel density was also calculated as the total vessel lengths divided by the total area of the image. Both indices were automatically calculated by means of dedicated software (Automated Vascular Analysis 3.0). Perfusion was then categorized by eye as present (normal continuous flow for at least 15 seconds), sluggish (decreased but continuous flow for at least 15 seconds), absent (no flow for at least 50% of the time), or intermittent (no flow for less than 50% of the time). The proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) was calculated as follows: 100 × [(total number of vessels - [no flow + intermittent flow])/total number of vessels]. Perfused vessel density (PVD) was calculated by multiplying vessel density by the proportion of perfused vessels. Microvascular flow index was used to quantify microvascular blood flow. In this score, flow is characterized as absent (0), intermittent (1), sluggish (2), or normal (3). Since our investigation was focused on small and medium vessels, calculations were performed separately for vessels with diameters of smaller than 20 μm (MFIs) and of larger than 20 μm but smaller than 50 μm (MFIm). Vessel size was determined with the aid of a micrometer scale. For each patient, values obtained from the three mucosa fields were averaged. To assess flow heterogeneity between the different areas investigated, we used the heterogeneity index. The latter was calculated as the highest site flow velocity minus the lowest site flow velocity, divided by the mean flow velocity of all sublingual sites. Percentage changes from baseline for all variables were determined as dVariable = 100 × [(Value 24 hours /Value BL) - 1].

### The effects of levosimendan in cardiac surgery patients with poor left ventricular function [^6422d024]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with poor left ventricular function often require inotropic drug support immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass. Levosimendan improves cardiac function by a novel mechanism of action compared to currently available drugs. We hypothesized that, in patients with severely compromised ventricular function, the use of levosimendan would be associated with better postoperative cardiac function than with inotropic drugs that increase myocardial oxygen consumption.

Methods

Thirty patients with a preoperative ejection fraction < or =30% scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to two different inotropic protocols: milrinone 0.5 microg [corrected] x kg(-1) x min(-1) or levosimendan 0.1 microg [corrected] x kg(-1) x min(-1), started immediately after the release of the aortic crossclamp. The treatment was masked to the observers. All patients received dobutamine 5 microg [corrected] x kg(-1) x min(-1).

Results

Stroke volume was similar between groups initially after surgery, but it declined 12 h after surgery in the milrinone group but not in the levosimendan group (P < 0.05 between groups) despite similar filling pressures. Total dose, duration of inotropic drug administration and norepinephrine dose were lower in the levosimendan group than in the milrinone group (P < 0.05). The duration of tracheal intubation was shorter in the former group compared with the milrinone group (P = 0008). Three patients in the milrinone group but none in the levosimendan group died within 30 days of surgery.

Conclusion

In cardiac surgery patients with a low preoperative ejection fraction, stroke volume was better maintained with the combination of dobutamine with levosimendan than with the combination of dobutamine with milrinone.

Regarding specific circumstances for pulmonary hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering inodilators (dobutamine, milrinone, levosimendan) to increase cardiac output and lower pulmonary vascular resistance in the perioperative period according to the patient's hemodynamic status.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^fb91a5a3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Epinephrine in septic shock—evidence for optimal management when high dose vasopressors are required is scant, and epinephrine has been suggested as second or third-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock. A network meta-analysis found no significant mortality difference between epinephrine and vasopressin (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47–1.88). Epinephrine might be useful in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.

Twelve-lead ECG recording and interpretation

The 12-lead ECGs were recorded at baseline (before study-drug infusion), and 6 hours, 2 days, and 4 days after initiation of the study drug, yielding a total of 373 ECGs. ECGs were read by two reviewers who were blinded to randomization group and troponin levels, by using a checklist to standardize the interpretation. Before the ECG interpretation, a calibration exercise was performed by the two reviewers to refine definitions and maximize interobserver agreement: this exercise and the checklist were previously published. Each ECG was analyzed for rhythm and the presence of Q waves, ST elevation, ST depression, and T-wave inversion. Additionally, the readers assessed whether the ECG was normal or abnormal, and whether, in their opinion, the ECG changes represented ischemia.

Serum cardiac markers

Troponin I or T, CK, and CK-MB levels were measured in all patients at the same time points as the ECG recordings. Of the nine sites, six measured troponin I (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL; or Dade Behring Inc, Newark, DE, USA), two measured troponin T (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), and one switched the assay from troponin I to T during the trial. Table 1 illustrates multiinstitutional laboratory troponin criteria used to diagnose myocardial ischemia or infarction; we also categorized troponin as normal, weakly positive, and highly positive. We further categorized patients regarding troponin elevation. They were categorized as highly positive if they had a highly positive troponin at any time. If they never had a highly positive troponin level, and had a weakly positive troponin level at any time, they were categorized as weakly positive. They were categorized as normal if they had no troponin elevation at any time.

Ischemia based on ECG

Patients were categorized as having no ischemia, possible ischemia, or probable ischemia, based on ECG interpretations. Patients categorized as having no ischemia were those for whom both readers agreed on the absence of ischemic changes on all of their ECGs. Patients categorized as having probable ischemia were those for whom both readers agreed on the presence of ischemic changes on any single ECG. The remainder of patients were categorized as having possible ischemia, defined as the presence of ischemia on any ECG, without agreement between the two readers. In addition, at each site, using all available clinical data, including troponin levels, the local investigator independently assessed in real time whether the patient met criteria for acute myocardial infarction.
