## Question

treatment high serum calcium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating high serum calcium (hypercalcemia). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypercalcemia and grading severity. Then, I should verify the etiology using intact PTH to separate PTH-dependent from PTH-independent pathways. Next, I need to check immediate stabilization with isotonic saline, followed by cause-directed antiresorptive therapy, adjuncts for severe cases, and special considerations such as renal impairment. After that, I will review strategies for refractory hypercalcemia, surgical indications in PHPT, monitoring for complications, and long-term disease-directed therapy, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and labeling data.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity before I do anything else, because mistaking pseudo-hypercalcemia for true hypercalcemia can misdirect therapy; I should correct total serum calcium for albumin or, ideally, measure ionized calcium, and categorize severity as mild (< 12 mg/dL), moderate (12–14 mg/dL), or severe (> 14 mg/dL) with attention to symptoms such as confusion, volume depletion, and arrhythmia risk [^117NS27X].

> Wait, I should verify renal function and volume status up front since both influence treatment choice and safety; the Endocrine Society recommends assessing CrCl or eGFR before IV bisphosphonates and prioritizing IV hydration as first-line while tailoring fluids to cardiac status, because many patients present dehydrated and at risk for fluid overload if I am not careful [^115jPgSs] [^1165qPtd].

> Next, I need to check the etiology with an intact PTH, since an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH points to PTH-dependent causes like primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, whereas a suppressed PTH (< 20 pg/mL, assay dependent) suggests malignancy-mediated, vitamin D–mediated, granulomatous disease, medications, or other less common mechanisms; I should also consider drugs such as thiazides, vitamin D analogs, and lithium when PTH is not suppressed, keeping in mind lithium's association with hypercalcemia albeit with variable mechanisms [^117NS27X] [^115V5AeX].

> I will now initiate immediate stabilization with isotonic saline, because restoring intravascular volume improves GFR and calciuresis; initial rates of about 200–300 mL/h with adjustment to achieve a urine output near 100–150 mL/h are reasonable, but hold on, I must avoid overhydration in heart failure and use clinical endpoints to titrate, and I should not reach for loop diuretics until euvolemia is clearly established to avoid worsening hypercalcemia from prerenal azotemia [^116DARnd] [^1165qPtd] [^116DARnd].

> For PTH-independent hypercalcemia, especially hypercalcemia of malignancy, I should start an antiresorptive early; zoledronic acid 4 mg IV is preferred and, wait, I initially thought it must be infused over 30 minutes, but I should double-check the label which specifies at least 15 minutes, and many guidelines allow 15–30 minutes, so infusing over at least 15 minutes is appropriate, with pamidronate 60–90 mg IV over 2–24 hours as an alternative and renal-adjusted infusion times when CrCl < 60 mL/min; in significant renal impairment or if bisphosphonates are contraindicated, denosumab 120 mg SC is reasonable and guideline-supported [^115NFJdx] [^111M18QY] [^116DARnd] [^115D7nUZ] [^114bM9tf].

> For PTH-dependent hypercalcemia, let me consider calcimimetic therapy first; cinacalcet reduces PTH via CaSR activation and is particularly relevant when surgery is delayed or contraindicated, such as in parathyroid carcinoma, and if hypercalcemia persists, I should add an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab and obtain surgical consultation for definitive management, while remembering that in primary hyperparathyroidism parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment, with AAES recommending surgery when serum calcium is more than 1 mg/dL above normal even if asymptomatic [^112L1pMf] [^114eo9oZ] [^115H7x1z] [^112NNX9U] [^114YZidV].

> If the patient presents with severe or life-threatening hypercalcemia (for example, calcium > 14 mg/dL with neurocardiac compromise), I should add rapid-acting adjuncts; calcitonin 4–8 IU/kg SC or IM every 6–12 hours lowers calcium within about 4 hours but tachyphylaxis limits its use to 48 hours, and I should combine it with a bisphosphonate or denosumab for durability; corticosteroids are reserved for calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia such as lymphoma or granulomatous disease, and in refractory, hemodynamically unstable settings with AKI or heart failure, hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath is appropriate as a temporizing measure [^112WBYfC] [^111f3qBb] [^116bnFg4] [^11436HwS] [^1158y4CC].

> Hold on, if calcium remains elevated 48–72 hours after a bisphosphonate or the patient relapses quickly, I should re-evaluate and consider denosumab for refractory disease; the guideline supports denosumab in bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcemia, with evidence showing meaningful response rates and durable control, and in select symptomatic cases not responding to fluids, gallium nitrate is an alternative after ensuring adequate hydration [^114YJv7v] [^117LBWPR] [^113QsNFm].

> I need to ensure I adapt therapy to renal function; when CrCl is reduced, I should lengthen zoledronic acid to 30–60 minutes and pamidronate to 2–24 hours or prefer denosumab to avoid further renal insult, and I must monitor closely for post-treatment hypocalcemia, particularly if vitamin D is low, so checking and repleting vitamin D mitigates that risk [^115D7nUZ] [^114bM9tf] [^1142ghTs].

> Let me think about primary hyperparathyroidism beyond the acute phase; surgery is curative for eligible patients, and for those not undergoing surgery, I should correct vitamin D deficiency to at least 50 nmol/L to lower PTH without worsening hypercalcemia, something clinicians often hesitate to do despite evidence that appropriate replacement reduces PTH without raising calcium, with careful monitoring during repletion [^114YZidV] [^111DWHjG] [^114osHtk].

> Next, I should review monitoring to prevent complications; during acute therapy I will check calcium, creatinine, magnesium, and phosphate frequently, at least daily initially, then taper as stable, and I should remember that hypercalcemia potentiates digitalis toxicity, so if the patient is on digoxin I must consider dose adjustment and ECG monitoring as calcium normalizes; with ongoing antiresorptives, I should also monitor oral health and dentition because of osteonecrosis of the jaw risk and optimize dental hygiene [^113nCtSD] [^113t9rjH] [^1161vCqA] [^113Au5MX].

> But wait, what if the hypercalcemia is driven by the underlying disease process that I can modify; for malignancy, disease-directed therapy reduces hypercalcemic drivers such as PTHrP and osteolytic activity, for PHPT, parathyroidectomy resolves the biochemical derangement, and for calcitriol-mediated granulomatous disease or inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression such as glucocorticoids or steroid-sparing agents like infliximab may correct the calcium physiology when inflammation is controlled [^116DARnd] [^114YZidV] [^116bnFg4].

> To summarize and ensure I have not missed a step, I confirm true hypercalcemia and grade severity, obtain intact PTH to direct the pathway, replete volume with isotonic saline while avoiding early loop diuretics, start antiresorptives tailored to etiology and renal function, add calcitonin for severe cases and steroids only for calcitriol-mediated disease, consider dialysis in unstable or renally compromised patients, pivot to denosumab if refractory to bisphosphonates, monitor calcium, kidney function, magnesium, phosphate, vitamin D, and oral health, and pursue definitive management of the underlying cause, all aligned with contemporary Endocrine Society guidance and drug labeling to maximize safety and efficacy [^1154nhGm] [^1165qPtd] [^114bM9tf] [^115NFJdx].

---

The treatment of high serum calcium (hypercalcemia) depends on severity and cause, with IV hydration as first-line [^1165qPtd] and bisphosphonates or denosumab for malignancy [^114bM9tf]. Calcitonin provides rapid, short-term lowering [^112WBYfC]; loop diuretics are used only after rehydration [^116DARnd]; glucocorticoids are for vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia [^112HFaG5]; and dialysis is reserved for severe, refractory cases or renal failure [^1158y4CC]. Definitive therapy targets the cause, such as parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^114YZidV] or calcimimetics for parathyroid carcinoma [^112L1pMf].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Mild hypercalcemia is 10.5–12 mg/dL (2.6–3.0 mmol/L), moderate is 12–14 mg/dL (3.0–3.5 mmol/L) [^117NS27X], and severe is > 14 mg/dL (> 3.5 mmol/L) [^111f3qBb].

---

## General supportive measures

### Intravenous hydration

Use isotonic saline as **first-line IV hydration** to correct dehydration and increase renal calcium excretion [^1165qPtd]. Start at **200–300 mL/h** and titrate to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h [^1162YY3B]. Avoid overhydration in heart failure or renal impairment [^1162YY3B].

---

### Loop diuretics

Use loop diuretics only after **adequate hydration** to promote calciuresis [^1162YY3B]; **furosemide** is commonly used [^1162YY3B].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Bisphosphonates

- **Mechanism**: Inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption [^116381pj].
- **Indication**: Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) [^114bM9tf].
- **Agents**: Zoledronic acid (4 mg IV over 15 min) [^115NFJdx] or pamidronate (60–90 mg IV over 2–24 h) [^116DARnd] [^114bM9tf].
- **Onset**: 24–48 h; duration 1–3 weeks [^114bM9tf].
- **Renal dosing**: Required in renal insufficiency [^115D7nUZ].

---

### Denosumab

Denosumab is a **RANKL inhibitor** that reduces osteoclast activity. It is indicated for bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy or when renal impairment limits bisphosphonate use [^114YJv7v] [^117LBWPR]. Dose **120 mg SC** on days 1, 8, and 15, then every 4 weeks [^114bM9tf]; onset is in 2–4 days, with a duration of 2–3 weeks [^114bM9tf].

---

### Calcitonin

Calcitonin rapidly inhibits osteoclasts and increases renal calcium excretion [^1162YY3B]. Use for severe hypercalcemia as a bridge to definitive therapy. Dose **4–8 IU/kg SC/IM every 6–12 hours**, and **limit use to ≤ 48 hours** due to tachyphylaxis [^1162YY3B] [^112WBYfC].

---

### Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids reduce intestinal calcium absorption and vitamin D activation. They are indicated for **vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia** (e.g. lymphoma, granulomatous disease) [^112HFaG5] [^116bnFg4]. Typical dosing is **prednisone 40–60 mg/day** or equivalent [^112HFaG5].

---

### Calcimimetics

Calcimimetics activate the calcium-sensing receptor to reduce parathyroid hormone secretion. Indicated for parathyroid carcinoma or secondary hyperparathyroidism; **cinacalcet 30–90 mg orally twice daily** is the agent of choice.

---

## Dialysis

Dialysis is indicated for **severe hypercalcemia** with renal failure, refractory to medical therapy, or life-threatening arrhythmias; use **hemodialysis with low-calcium dialysate** [^1158y4CC].

---

## Definitive management based on underlying cause

| **Cause** | **Definitive treatment** |
|-|-|
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | Parathyroidectomy [^114YZidV] |
| Parathyroid carcinoma | - Surgical resection [^112NNX9U] <br/> - Calcimimetics if unresectable [^112L1pMf] |
| Hypercalcemia of malignancy | - Treat underlying malignancy [^11436HwS] <br/> - Bisphosphonates or denosumab [^111M18QY] [^114bM9tf] |
| Vitamin D intoxication | - Discontinue vitamin D [^112Nbuvs] <br/> - Glucocorticoids [^112HFaG5] |
| Granulomatous disease | - Glucocorticoids <br/> - Treat underlying disease [^112HFaG5] [^116uRQtU] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Serum calcium**: Monitor daily until stable, then regularly [^113nCtSD].
- **Renal function**: Monitor and adjust therapy as needed [^115jPgSs].
- **Electrolytes**: Monitor magnesium and phosphate; replete if low [^113nCtSD].
- **Vitamin D**: Monitor to avoid hypocalcemia during antiresorptive therapy [^1142ghTs].
- **Oral health**: Monitor during antiresorptive therapy [^1161vCqA].

---

## Potential complications of untreated hypercalcemia

- **Renal**: Nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, renal failure [^117NS27X].
- **Cardiac**: Arrhythmias, hypertension [^1158y4CC].
- **Neurologic**: Confusion, coma [^117NS27X].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis [^112BrMNH].
- **Skeletal**: Osteoporosis, fractures [^114NPRLk].

---

Effective management of high serum calcium requires rapid assessment, supportive care, and targeted pharmacologic therapy, with **definitive treatment of the underlying cause** to prevent recurrence and complications [^1154nhGm].

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^111nwcmz]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Preventing signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, maintaining serum calcium levels in the low normal range or slightly below normal, preventing hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, keeping the calcium-phosphate product below 55 mg/dL, and preventing renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis) and other extraskeletal calcifications are the main objectives of treatment. Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPTH) includes not only the emergency management of acute and severe hypocalcemia with intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, but also the management of chronic hypocalcemia with calcium, calcitriol, and magnesium supplements, whenever required.

The normalization of serum calcium levels through traditional treatment involving calcium and active vitamin D fails to fully restore normal calcium homeostasis physiology. Instead, it leads to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia because it lacks renal calcium reabsorption and phosphaturia typically stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Consequently, this standard approach heightens the risk of extraskeletal calcifications and long-term kidney complications. Moreover, the absence of PTH results in abnormal bone remodeling and contributes to reduced quality of life for many hypoparathyroidism patients despite adhering to conventional therapy.

These challenges have prompted scientific exploration into alternative therapeutic avenues. Since the mid-1990s, synthetic PTH (1–34) has been proposed for the management of refractory HypoPTH, with promising results. Recombinant human PTH (rhPTH 1–84) has been approved for the treatment of adults with HypoPTH refractory to conventional therapy.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112iiP6s]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Calcium metabolism in cancer and hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumors that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

- **Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy**: Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates (which are administered intravenously) are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the mainstay of treatment, whereas denosumab (which is administered subcutaneously) may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

- **Hypocalcaemia: Treatment and prevention**: Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but it can occur in patients with a variety of tumor types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim; at-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption and closely monitored during at least the first few months.

### Lithium-associated hypercalcemia: Pathophysiology, prevalence, management [^115V5AeX]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

We studied hypercalcemia in bipolar disorder. The prevalence of hypercalcemia in the entire study population is 15.5%, with hypercalcemia remaining strongly associated with lithium treatment, even when adjusted for sociodemographic factors and medications. This study demonstrates that a causal relationship between lithium treatment and the development of hypercalcemia may be presumed. Amid the plethora of possible mechanisms of action, the exact mechanism in the individual is difficult to ascertain. While polypharmacy, which was higher in the bipolar patients with lithium, may at the clinical level have a bearing on the occurrence of hypercalcemia, it does not explain the statistically higher levels of calcium at the group level. In addition, all seven lithium-treated bipolar patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for lithium-associated hypercalcemia were not cured at the initial operation; one patient had persistent disease, and six patients showed clear biochemical signs of recurrence at follow-up.

- **How common is lithium-associated hypercalcemia?** Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine condition, with a prevalence of approximately 0.5% in the general population, rising to 2–3% in postmenopausal women. Lithium-associated hypercalcemia is characterised by mildly elevated calcium levels, which occur chronically or intermittently. Despite numerous articles highlighting the credible association between lithium and the development of hypercalcemia, the monitoring of parathyroid function has only recently been included in the revised recommendations of NICE and the International Society for Bipolar Disorders.

### Pamidronate disodium [^116DARnd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The indications and usage of Pamidronate disodium include the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and Paget's disease.

- **Hypercalcemia of malignancy**: Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP, when combined with adequate hydration, is indicated for treating moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Both patients with epidermoid and non-epidermoid tumors respond to this treatment. It is crucial to initiate vigorous saline hydration promptly as an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy and to aim for restoring urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Conservative measures, such as saline hydration with or without loop diuretics, can be used for mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia. Patients must remain adequately hydrated throughout the treatment, but overhydration should be avoided, particularly in patients with cardiac failure. Diuretic therapy should not be used before correcting hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in treating hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or other non-tumor-related conditions have not been established.

- **Paget's disease**: Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP is indicated for treating patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of this treatment was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase levels that are three or more times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP therapy has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase levels in patients with Paget's disease.

### Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with circulating PTH, phosphate and calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^114osHtk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite NIH clinical recommendations, many clinicians are reluctant to replace vitamin D in patients with hypercalcemia due to concerns over exacerbating the condition. Additionally, the optimal level of vitamin D replacement for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a large retrospective study to ascertain whether a relationship exists between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium, and other important biochemical markers in patients with PHP. Biochemical measurements from serum, plasma, and urine were collected from 251 patients diagnosed with hypercalcemia associated with PHP.

- **Results**: When examining mean circulating levels during clinical follow-up, a strong correlation was found between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) (r = -0.23, P = 0.0003), as well as serum phosphate (r = 0.16, P = 0.0119). No significant relation was observed between serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.002, P = 0.98). It was noted that mean plasma PTH during follow-up was 51% lower in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels > 60 nm compared to those with lower levels. Furthermore, patients maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels > 60 nm experienced significantly reduced PTH hypersecretion without demonstrating worsened hypercalcemia compared to those with deficient levels.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114bM9tf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypercalcemia of malignancy, with specific emphasis on antiresorptive therapies, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend initiating treatment with an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab in adult patients with HCM. It is advised to consider preferring denosumab over intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Breast cancer: Bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic bone disease [^113Au5MX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

The indications of bisphosphonate therapy in breast cancer patients range from the correction of hypercalcemia to the prevention of cancer treatment-induced bone loss. Bisphosphonates are part of our therapeutic armamentarium against metastatic bone pain, and at least 50% of the patients benefit from a clinically relevant analgesic effect. Placebo-controlled trials with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates have shown that prolonged administration can reduce the frequency of skeletal-related events by 30% to 40%. The superiority of zoledronic acid compared with pamidronate has been demonstrated by a multiple-event analysis in a large randomized trial. The short infusion time of zoledronic acid also constitutes a convenient therapy. Where available, oral ibandronate offers an interesting alternative, especially for patients receiving hormone therapy.

There are some toxicity concerns with the prolonged use of bisphosphonates. The occasional renal toxicity of zoledronic acid has led to the recommendation to monitor renal function before each infusion and to adjust the dose according to creatinine clearance. Osteonecrosis of the jaw could occur in up to 2.5% of breast cancer patients during long-term bisphosphonate therapy. It is often a significant complication that seems to be linked with the duration of therapy.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^1179PD2p]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Following intravenous saline hydration, zoledronic acid or denosumab is the standard treatment for PTH-independent hypercalcemia. In contrast, calcimimetics such as cinacalcet and etelcalcetide are typically used to treat PTH-dependent hypercalcemia (e.g. primary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism) or to reduce PTH in secondary hyperparathyroidism.

In both cases, calcimimetics are thought to reduce PTH secretion by parathyroid cells through activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). If this is the sole mechanism of action, calcimimetics would seem to have little role in the treatment of PTH-independent hypercalcemia, in which the PTH is already suppressed. However, animal studies show that calcimimetics can reduce the hypercalcemia induced by teriparatide, suggesting a role for calcimimetics in the treatment of PTH-independent hypercalcemia.

Furthermore, several case reports suggest that cinacalcet can be used in PTH-independent hypercalcemia that is refractory to antiresorptive therapy. However, the exact mechanism of action is unknown. We report a case of hypercalcemia due to increased PTHrP that responded well to cinacalcet therapy without previous bisphosphonate therapy, and we demonstrate that increased renal excretion of calcium may play a role.

### Onco-nephrology: The pathophysiology and treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^11436HwS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia complicates the course of 10%-30% of all patients with malignancies and can be a sign of very poor prognosis and advanced malignancy. Prompt recognition of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and the institution of therapy can be lifesaving, affording the opportunity to address the underlying etiology. The mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia generally fall into three categories: humoral hypercalcemia due to secreted factors (such as parathyroid-related hormone), local osteolysis due to tumor invasion of bone, and absorptive hypercalcemia due to excess vitamin D produced by malignancies.

The mainstays of therapy for hypercalcemia are aggressive intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, and perhaps loop diuretics. Adjunctive therapy may include calcitonin and corticosteroids. In refractory cases, gallium nitrate and denosumab are alternatives. In patients presenting with severe AKI, hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath can be effective. In most cases, therapy normalizes calcium levels and allows for palliation or curative therapy of the malignancy.

### Hypoparathyroidism: Less severe hypocalcemia with treatment with vitamin D2 compared with calcitriol [^117RpiVm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

Options for chronic treatment of hypoparathyroidism include calcitriol, recombinant human parathyroid hormone, and high-dose vitamin D (D2). D2 is used in a minority of patients because of fear of prolonged hypercalcemia and renal toxicity. There is a paucity of recent data about D2 use in hypoparathyroidism.

- **Objective**: Compare renal function, hypercalcemia, and hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism treated chronically with either D2 (D2 group) or calcitriol.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A retrospective study of patients with hypoparathyroidism treated at the University of Maryland Hospital. Participants were identified by a billing record search with diagnosis confirmed by chart review. Thirty patients were identified; 16 were treated chronically with D2, and 14 with calcitriol. Data were extracted from medical records.

- **Main outcome measures**: Serum creatinine and calcium, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits for hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia.

- **Results**: D2 and calcitriol groups were similar in age (58.9 ± 16.7 vs. 50.9 ± 22.6 years, P = 0.28), sex, and treatment duration (17.8 ± 14.2 vs. 8.5 ± 4.4 years, P = 0.076). Hospitalization or ED visits for hypocalcemia occurred in none of the D2 group vs. four of 14 in the calcitriol group (P = 0.03); three in the calcitriol group had multiple ED visits. There were no differences between D2 and calcitriol groups in hospitalizations or ED visits for hypercalcemia, serum creatinine or calcium, or kidney stones.

- **Conclusion**: We found less morbidity from hypocalcemia in hypoparathyroid patients treated with D2 compared to those treated with calcitriol.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112WBYfC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within four hours of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be administered at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 hours. The duration of dosing is limited to 48 hours due to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy involves rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. Additionally, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease in high serum calcium levels.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, specifically concerning treatment targets, the UKKA 2011 guidelines recommend maintaining serum calcium, adjusted for albumin concentration, within the normal reference range for the laboratory used. This measurement should be taken before a 'short-gap' dialysis session in patients on hemodialysis. It is advised to maintain adjusted serum calcium in the range of 2.2–2.5 mmol/L, while avoiding episodes of hypercalcemia.

### Pamidronate disodium [^1167AdQ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In a third multicenter, randomized, parallel double-blind trial, a group of 69 cancer patients with hypercalcemia were enrolled to receive 60 mg of pamidronate disodium as a 4- or 24-hour infusion, which was compared to a saline-treatment group. Patients with a corrected serum calcium level of ≥ 12.0 mg/dL after 24 hours of saline hydration were eligible for this trial.

The mean baseline-corrected serum calcium levels for pamidronate disodium 60-mg 4-hour infusion, pamidronate disodium 60-mg 24-hour infusion, and saline infusion were 14.2 mg/dL, 13.7 mg/dL, and 13.7 mg/dL, respectively.

By Day 7 after the initiation of treatment, 78%, 61%, and 22% of the patients had normal-corrected serum calcium levels for the 60-mg 4-hour infusion, 60-mg 24-hour infusion, and saline infusion, respectively. At Day 14, 39% of the patients in the pamidronate disodium 60-mg 4-hour infusion group and 26% of the patients in the pamidronate disodium 60-mg 24-hour infusion group had normal-corrected serum calcium levels or maintenance of a partial response.

### Hypercalcemia: A review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L), or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease, such as sarcoidosis; endocrinopathies, such as thyroid disease; immobilization; genetic disorders; and medications, such as thiazide diuretics and supplements, including calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A.

Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause.

For patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, particularly those with renal insufficiency, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend administering zoledronic acid or pamidronate with renal dosing. Zoledronic acid should be infused over 30–60 minutes, while pamidronate should be administered over 2–24 hours. This applies to adult patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 60 mL/min who are treated with intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Rare causes of hypercalcemia: 2021 update [^116b7eai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the etiology of hypercalcemia, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis of rare causes of hypercalcemia, extending the observations of the original article.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive, extensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology", as well as examining the references in the identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults versus pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definite assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanisms with discussion of likely etiology.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause of hypercalcemia is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology.

- **Conclusions**: The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.

### Zemplar [^113t9rjH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including Zemplar capsules, can cause over-suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10)]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with Zemplar may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination, and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Zemplar treatment to avoid hypercalcemia.

- **Digitalis toxicity**: Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Zemplar capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds.

- **Laboratory tests**: During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium levels should be monitored regularly to prevent complications associated with hypercalcemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage that progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, but even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and to those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and monitoring for the development of organ damage should be offered.

### Calcium acetate [^112j3etJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Overdosage of calcium acetate can occur when administered in amounts exceeding the recommended daily dosage, leading to hypercalcemia [see warnings and precautions (5.1)].

---

### Calcium acetate [^117SJqvZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting calcium acetate and Vitamin D. Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of calcium acetate.

Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Patients with end-stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate.

An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the calcium acetate dosage or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcifications. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in the early detection of soft tissue calcification.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^1162YY3B]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The most effective therapy for patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy is treating the underlying cancer to reduce tumor production of factors promoting bone resorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption; however, this may not always be possible or effective in patients with advanced cancer. Therefore, therapies that inhibit bone resorption and promote renal calcium excretion become important.

Most patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy are dehydrated at presentation, making rehydration often the first step of treatment. Saline should be administered at a maximal initial rate of 200–300 mL/h, then adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h. This approach relieves symptoms rather than addressing the underlying disease, thus rehydration alone rarely resolves hypercalcaemia. Nearly all patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy exhibit increased osteoclastic bone resorption; hence, the inhibition of bone resorption is a key target for managing the condition.

### Targeting serum calcium in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease: Is normal too high [^1152xPwf]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia is common in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and it is standard practice to correct this back to the normal range, presumably to prevent symptomatic hypocalcemia and help control hyperparathyroidism. However, there are few studies to support this approach, and recent data suggest that this promotes vascular calcification and adynamic bone disease. Whether setting a lower target will improve outcomes has not been tested, but existing data suggest that this may have minimal risks and substantial potential benefits and should be explored.

Hypercalciuria is an important, identifiable, and reversible risk factor in stone formation. The foremost and most fundamental step in dissecting the genetics of hypercalciuria is understanding its pathophysiology. Hypercalciuria is a complex trait. This article outlines the various factors that compromise the attempt to dissect the genetics of hypercalciuria, summarizes the clinical and experimental monogenic causes of hypercalciuria, and outlines the initial results from attempts in studying polygenic hypercalciuria. Finally, the problem is set in perspective of the database, technological advances and limitations are highlighted, and prospects of further advances in the field are speculated upon.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition known as hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria and anuria, as well as somnolence and coma. Once a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program must be followed to either prove or exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In cases where primary hyperparathyroidism is confirmed, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid a fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours; during this time, serum calcium levels should be lowered. The treatment of choice is hemodialysis with a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates may be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### Acute management of hypercalcemia of malignancy - a review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115pY2Q7]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

- **Recent findings**: We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Calcium acetate [^111uFSBL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is discussed elsewhere [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The most common (> 10%) adverse reactions are hypercalcemia, nausea, and vomiting. In clinical studies, patients have occasionally experienced nausea during calcium acetate therapy.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical studies, calcium acetate has been generally well tolerated. Calcium acetate was studied in a 3-month, open-label, non-randomized study of 98 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients, and an alternate liquid formulation of calcium acetate was studied in a two-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 69 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients. Adverse reactions (> 2% on treatment) from these trials are presented in Table 1. Mild hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic or manifest itself as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. More severe hypercalcemia is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of calcium acetate-induced hypercalcemia. Isolated cases of pruritus have been reported, which may represent allergic reactions.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1154nhGm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is the most common metabolic complication of malignancies, though its incidence may be declining due to potent chemotherapeutic agents. The high mortality associated with HCM has significantly decreased due to increasingly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. Despite the widespread availability of efficacious medications to treat HCM, evidence-based recommendations for managing this debilitating condition are lacking.

- **Objective**: To develop guidelines for the treatment of adults with HCM.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in systematic literature review, identified and prioritized eight clinical questions related to the treatment of HCM in adult patients. The systematic reviews (SRs) queried electronic databases for studies relevant to the selected questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. An independent SR was conducted in parallel to assess patients' and physicians' values and preferences, costs, resources needed, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and other domains relevant to the Evidence-to-Decision framework to enable judgements and recommendations.

- **Results**: The panel strongly recommends the treatment of adults with HCM using denosumab (Dmab) or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP). The following recommendations are based on a low certainty of the evidence. The panel suggests a conditional recommendation for adults with HCM.

### The use of zoledronic acid, a novel, highly potent bisphosphonate, for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy [^116381pj]. The Oncologist (2002). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a serious complication of cancer that affects patients with and without bone metastases. A single infusion of pamidronate disodium, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, effectively normalizes serum calcium in the majority of patients treated for up to one month. Zoledronic acid is a new-generation, heterocyclic nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and the most potent inhibitor of bone resorption identified at the time of writing.

- **Methods**: The natural history, clinical presentation, and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy are reviewed, with a focus on the mechanisms of action and relative efficacy and safety of bisphosphonate therapies.

- **Results**: The improved efficacy of zoledronic acid compared with pamidronate disodium has been demonstrated in a pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. In these trials, both zoledronic acid and pamidronate disodium were safe and well tolerated; however, zoledronic acid treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of complete responses, more rapid calcium normalization, and more durable responses compared with pamidronate disodium.

- **Conclusions**: Given the superior efficacy and comparable safety profile of zoledronic acid compared with pamidronate disodium, zoledronic acid is likely to become the treatment of choice for hypercalcemia of malignancy.

### The efficacy and safety of denosumab for treating hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: A retrospective study [^111jkTeL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Denosumab is approved for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy, but data on its efficacy for hypercalcemia related to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are limited. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of denosumab with zoledronic acid in PHPT-related hypercalcemia.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively collected data from 29 PHPT patients with moderate/severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium [CSC] ≥ 3.0 mmol/L) treated with denosumab (60 or 120 mg; Dmab group) and CSC-matched 29 PHPT patients treated with zoledronic acid (4 mg; ZA group). The primary efficacy outcome was the change of CSC (ΔCa), while secondary outcomes included the response proportion, time to response, and duration of response. Safety data were also collected.

- **Results**: Both groups showed significant reductions in CSC levels (Dmab: 3.37 ± 0.37 mmol/L to 2.64 ± 0.33 mmol/L, p < 0.01; ZA: 3.41 ± 0.32 mmol/L to 2.57 ± 0.23 mmol/L, p < 0.01), with similar ΔCa. In the Dmab group, 82.8% (24/29) responded with CSC levels below 3.0 mmol/L, and 72.4% (21/29) achieved complete response (CR, serum CSC less than 2.7 mmol/L), comparable to the ZA group. The time to CR was shorter for ZA (3.0 vs. 7.0 days, p < 0.01), while Dmab had a longer duration of response (19.0 vs. 13.0 days, p = 0.02). Hypocalcemia occurred in 6.9% (2/29, both with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3b) of Dmab patients, while none in the ZA group.

- **Conclusion**: A single 60 mg dose of denosumab effectively reduces serum calcium levels in PHPT patients with moderate/severe hypercalcemia, at least maintaining efficacy for a median of nearly 3 weeks.

### Denosumab for treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy [^117LBWPR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) in patients with advanced cancer is often caused by excessive osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Patients may not respond to or may relapse after IV bisphosphonate therapy.

We investigated whether denosumab, a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, reduces serum calcium in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory HCM. In this single-arm international study, participants had serum calcium levels corrected for albumin (CSC) > 12.5 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) despite bisphosphonates given > 7 and ≤ 30 days before screening.

Patients received 120 mg SC denosumab on days 1, 8, 15, and 29 and then every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with CSC ≤ 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L) (response) by day 10. Secondary endpoints included response by visit, duration of response, and the proportion of patients with a complete response (CSC ≤ 10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L]) by day 10 and during the study.

Patients (N = 33) had solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. By day 10, 21 patients (64%) reached CSC ≤ 11.5 mg/dL, and 12 patients (33%) reached CSC ≤ 10.8 mg/dL. During the study, 23 patients (70%) reached CSC ≤ 11.5 mg/dL, and 21 patients (64%) reached CSC ≤ 10.8 mg/dL. Estimated median response duration was 104 days. The most common serious adverse events were hypercalcemia worsening (5 patients, 15%) and dyspnea (3 patients, 9%).

In conclusion, in patients with HCM despite recent IV bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab lowered serum calcium.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116DmzkM]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca++ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild-to-moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol-mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia. Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways.

- **Transcellular pathway**: This is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D.
- **Paracellular pathway**: This can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin 12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport.

The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption. In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years. When the hypercalcemia is mild (i.e. less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]), patients often have relatively few symptoms. When the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely, a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, known as parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism.

Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low-normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in a patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described for patients with cancer.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, typically identified during the assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcemia must be evaluated by calculating adjusted calcium, and a thorough history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. Measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is warranted, with replacement initiated if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH levels were measured. This brief review describes the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Effects on calcium metabolism involve a risk of hypercalcemia. If aberrations in parameters of calcium metabolism are noted, discontinue VECTICAL Ointment until these normalize. Increased absorption may occur with occlusive use. VECTICAL Ointment should be used with caution in patients receiving medications known to increase the serum calcium level, such as thiazide diuretics, and in patients receiving calcium supplements or high doses of vitamin D.

- **Effects on calcium metabolism**: In controlled clinical trials, hypercalcemia was observed in subjects exposed to VECTICAL Ointment. If aberrations in parameters of calcium metabolism occur, treatment should be discontinued until these parameters have normalized. The effects of VECTICAL Ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations greater than 52 weeks have not been evaluated. Increased absorption may occur with occlusive use. VECTICAL Ointment should be used with caution in patients receiving medications known to increase the serum calcium level, such as thiazide diuretics, and in patients receiving calcium supplements or high doses of vitamin D.

### Management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism: The efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid [^115m17sh]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Severe hypercalcaemia in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism is known as a hyperparathyroid crisis. Its incidence ranges from 1.6% to 6%. Presentations of hyperparathyroid crisis are heterogeneous, including neurological alteration, dehydration, hypovolaemia, anorexia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, impaired cardiac and renal functions, and, if untreated, can lead to death. Thus, managing the parathyroid crisis urgently is imperative. Parathyroidectomy, to date, remains the only curative treatment option. However, preoperative medical antihypercalcaemic therapy is warranted as a holding measure. It consists of intravenous saline hydration, a loop diuretic, and intravenous administration of bisphosphonates and calcimimetics. Data evaluating the efficacy of these treatments are very limited.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid in the management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Calcitriol [^112Nbuvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage: Administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are the same as for an overdose of vitamin D (see adverse reactions). High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with calcitriol may lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg²/dL². High levels of calcium in the dialysate bath may contribute to the hypercalcemia (see warnings).

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**: General treatment of hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range) consists of immediate discontinuation of calcitriol therapy, institution of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia ensues. Hypercalcemia frequently resolves in 2 to 7 days. When serum calcium levels have returned to within normal limits, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose of 0.25 mcg/day less than prior therapy. Serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly after all dosage changes and subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate.

Bisphosphonates are effective for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HOM). However, efficacy and safety data for bisphosphonates in parathyroid hormone-related hypercalcemia (PTHRH) are rare, including pamidronate (Pam), which is not indicated for this condition.

- **Objective**: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pam for moderate-to-severe PTHRH.

- **Methods**: This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care medical center. Patients included adults hospitalized with serum calcium levels greater than 12 mg/dL from October 29, 2013, to December 17, 2019. Etiology was categorized as PTHRH or PTH-independent. Clinical and laboratory data of PTHRH patients treated with Pam (PTHRH-Pam+) were compared to Pam-untreated counterparts (PTHRH-Pam-).

- **Results**: Thirty-four patients with 37 hospitalizations for PTHRH (Pam-treated and untreated) met the inclusion criteria. Pam was administered in 24 of 37 cases (64.8%). Admission serum calcium levels for the PTHRH-Pam+ group were higher than for the PTHRH-Pam- group (14.4 mg/dL vs. 13.0 mg/dL, P = 0.005). The median total Pam dose was 60 mg (range, 30–180 mg) in the treated group. Serum calcium decreased by 3.5 mg/dL for PTHRH-Pam+ compared to 1.6 mg/dL for PTHRH-Pam- (P = 0.003). No PTHRH-Pam+ patients developed hypocalcemia or acute kidney injury. Nadir serum phosphorus levels were lower in the PTHRH-Pam+ vs. PTHRH-Pam- group (1.7 mg/dL vs. 2.4 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.004). Three PTHRH-Pam+ patients developed severe hypophosphatemia, which resolved with intravenous and oral supplementation. Seventeen patients underwent parathyroidectomy.

### Rapid fire: Hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The two most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, the acuity of treatment will depend on the severity of calcium level and symptoms.

In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116bnFg4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypercalcemia of malignancy, more specifically with respect to patients with calcitriol-secreting tumors, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab in adult patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) from tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, such as lymphomas, who are already receiving corticosteroid therapy but continue to experience severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia.

### Prognosis and phenotypes of advanced head and neck carcinoma associated with hypercalcemia [^111diyfJ]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is the most common life-threatening metabolic disorder observed in cancer patients, affecting approximately 10%–20% of individuals with advanced-stage malignancies. While the incidence of hypercalcemia is relatively low at the early stages of cancer (1%–5%), it increases significantly in patients with advanced disease, reaching rates of up to 30%–50%. Hypercalcemia in cancer patients mainly results from increased bone resorption, where calcium release from the bone exceeds the kidneys' excretory capacity.

- **Mechanisms of hypercalcemia**: Four mechanisms are responsible for hypercalcemia in cancer patients: local osteolysis, humoral hypercalcemia driven by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP), hypercalcemia mediated by 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and ectopic hyperparathyroidism, though the latter two are rare. Local osteolysis occurs when malignant cells disrupt calcium regulation through osteoclastic bone resorption, further promoted by tumor cells interacting with bone cells and cytokine secretion. PTH-rP secretion by tumors mimics parathyroid hormone action, increasing bone resorption and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.

- **Clinical symptoms and management**: Hypercalcemia presents a wide range of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia. However, more severe manifestations can occur, such as progressive mental impairment, renal failure, and, in extreme cases, coma or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest. The management of hypercalcemia typically involves aggressive rehydration and the administration of bone resorption inhibitors, primarily bisphosphonates.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^111qToPL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumours that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

- **Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy**: Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates, which are administered intravenously, are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the mainstay of treatment. Denosumab, administered subcutaneously, may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

- **Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia**: Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but can occur in patients with a variety of tumour types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim. At-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption and be closely monitored during at least the first few months of treatment.

### Active Crohn disease and hypercalcemia treated with infliximab: Case report and literature review [^112HFaG5]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To report a case of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia caused by active Crohn disease that improved with infliximab therapy, we present the clinical and laboratory findings and describe the clinical course of a patient who had hypercalcemia during Crohn disease exacerbations. The literature is reviewed regarding 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in Crohn disease, and the three cases of hypercalcemia in individuals with Crohn disease reported in the literature are described.

A 50-year-old man with long-standing Crohn disease, treated with multiple bowel resections, presented for take-down ileostomy. He was hypercalcemic and had suppressed parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide levels. Histopathology of the resected ileostomy site and adjacent small bowel indicated active Crohn disease. Hypercalcemia promptly resolved following a few days of treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids. One month later, hypercalcemia recurred in the presence of an inappropriately high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and increased urinary calcium and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. The serum and urinary calcium levels became normal with infliximab therapy. Three previous reports of hypercalcemia caused by active Crohn disease describe effective treatment with glucocorticoids. This is the first report of successful response to infliximab in this setting.

Hypercalcemia mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the setting of Crohn disease may respond to glucocorticoid-sparing immunomodulators.

### Zoledronic acid is superior to pamidronate in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy: a pooled analysis of two randomized, controlled clinical trials [^111M18QY]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). High credibility.

Two identical, concurrent, parallel, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials were conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid and pamidronate for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM).

Patients with moderate to severe HCM (corrected serum calcium [CSC] ≥ 3.00 mmol/L [12.0 mg/dL]) were treated with a single dose of zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg) via 5-minute infusion or pamidronate (90 mg) via 2-hour infusion. A protocol-specified pooled analysis of the two parallel trials was performed. Clinical endpoints included rate of complete response by day 10, response duration, and time to relapse.

Two hundred eighty-seven patients were randomized and evaluated for safety; 275 were evaluated for efficacy. Both doses of zoledronic acid were superior to pamidronate in the treatment of HCM. The complete response rates by day 10 were 88.4% (P = 0.002), 86.7% (P = 0.015), and 69.7% for zoledronic acid 4 mg and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg, respectively. Normalization of CSC occurred by day 4 in approximately 50% of patients treated with zoledronic acid and in only 33.3% of the pamidronate-treated patients. The median duration of complete response favored zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg over pamidronate 90 mg with response durations of 32, 43, and 18 days, respectively.

Zoledronic acid is superior to pamidronate; 4 mg is the dose recommended for the initial treatment of HCM and 8 mg for relapsed or refractory hypercalcemia.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^111mUUWb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. In the pivotal trial, three patients randomized to NATPARA required administration of IV fluids to correct hypercalcemia during treatment with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases of hypocalcemia that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest when NATPARA is withheld, missed, or abruptly discontinued, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D or calcium supplements or both if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity with concomitant use of digitalis compounds**: The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia of any cause may predispose to digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1161Kmkz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 Endocrine Society (ES) guidelines specifically address circumstances related to hypercalcemia of malignancy, particularly for patients with parathyroid carcinoma. The guidelines recommend considering the administration of a calcimimetic in adult patients with hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid carcinoma when it is not adequately controlled with intravenous bisphosphonates or denosumab.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^115tWxh6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia.

It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer. On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents.

Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### Non-malignant causes of hypercalcemia in cancer patients: A frequent and neglected occurrence [^1115vWCR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a frequent finding in cancer patients and can be observed in any type of cancer. Physicians in charge of cancer patients often overlook non-malignant causes of hypercalcemia. Our objective was to review the causes of hypercalcemia in a large series of cancer patients.

We conducted a retrospective study at a Cancer Centre, examining all consecutive hypercalcemic (Ca > 10.5 mg/dl) patients over an 8-year period. Of the 699 evaluated patients, 642 were analyzed after excluding those whose hypercalcemia resolved after rehydration or who had a normal Ca level after correction for protein concentrations. Clinical information was gathered on the type of cancer, its histology, whether the disease was active or in complete remission, and on the presence of bone metastases. Biochemical data included serum Ca, P(i), proteins in all patients; PTH in most patients; and PTHrP, 25OH-Vitamin D, 1,25(OH)(2)-Vitamin D, TSH, and T4 in selected cases.

By order of decreasing frequency, the main causes of hypercalcemia were:

- **Cancer (69.0%)**:
	- Bone metastases accounted for 53.0% of the cases.
	- Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) for 35.3% of the cases.
	- There were 11.7% of cases apparently due to both HHM and bone metastases.

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism (24.6%)**.
- **Hyperthyroidism (2.2%)**.
- **Milk alkali syndrome (0.9%)**.
- **Sarcoidosis (0.45%)**.

In patients who were in complete remission, 97% (84/87) experienced hypercalcemia not due to cancer. Even among patients with active neoplastic disease, the number of patients whose hypercalcemia was not due to the cancer itself was significant.

### Diagnosis and management of pseudohypoparathyroidism and related disorders: First international consensus statement [^116xt1RE]. Nature Reviews. Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of conventional management of PTH resistance include maintaining serum levels of calcium and phosphorus within the normal range while avoiding hypercalciuria (age and size corrected) and lowering PTH levels as permitted by serum and urinary levels of calcium. We recommend the use of the active vitamin D metabolite, calcitriol, or the active vitamin D analogue, alfacalcidol, with or without calcium supplementation as the mainstay of treatment for chronic hypocalcaemia. Patients should not be treated with PTH or PTH analogues. During treatment, levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus should be monitored every six months in asymptomatic patients and more frequently when clinically indicated. Patients and/or their families should be instructed about the symptoms and signs of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia.

- **Renal imaging**: We recommend appropriate renal imaging to evaluate nephrocalcinosis at transition.

- **Monitoring nephrocalcinosis**: We recommend age-appropriate renal imaging to monitor for the development or worsening of nephrocalcinosis in patients with persistent hypercalciuria upon repeated measurements and as clinically indicated.

- **Neurological and ophthalmological evaluation**: For the evaluation of long-term consequences of hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, a brain CT scan is indicated only when neurological manifestations are present. An ophthalmological examination is recommended to diagnose or exclude cataracts.

- **Phosphate binders**: Phosphate binders (other than calcium) are rarely, if ever, indicated in the management of severe and long-term persistent hyperphosphataemia.

### Physicians' attitude toward recurrent hypercalcemia in terminally ill cancer patients [^1169TikR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

There is no consensus regarding whether cancer-induced hypercalcemia should be treated up until the patient's death. The primary aim of this study was to clarify physicians' attitudes toward treating hypercalcemia in terminally ill cancer patients and associated factors.

- **Methods**: A nationwide, cross-sectional survey was performed involving 757 physicians of the Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine. Physicians' attitudes toward treating hypercalcemia in terminally ill patients were assessed based on the response to the question: do you agree that you provide medical treatment for hypercalcemia up until a patient's death? As potential determinants of physicians' attitudes, we examined their characteristics, beliefs about hypercalcemia, and beliefs about a good death.

- **Results**: We obtained a total of 380 (50.2%) analyzable responses. A total of 163 physicians (43%) agreed that hypercalcemia should be treated up until the patient's death, while the remaining 217 physicians (57%) disagreed. The independent determinants of the attitude included the following: physicians' specialty, belief that hypercalcemia treatment improves pain, belief that hypercalcemia treatment improves nausea, belief that hypercalcemia treatment improves quality of life, belief that hypercalcemia treatment prolongs life, belief that the effect of hypercalcemia treatment reduces gradually, belief that death with hypercalcemia is less distressing, and the perception that being mentally clear is important for a good death.

- **Conclusion**: Japanese physicians had different attitudes toward treating hypercalcemia in terminally ill cancer patients, influenced by various beliefs and perceptions.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones.

In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range, but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by the removal of the parathyroid gland or glands, but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^112Vx68p]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Responses to treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab:

- **Proportion of patients demonstrating a complete response at day 10**: In a pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind phase 3 trials involving patients with moderate-to-severe hypercalcaemia of malignancy, 275 patients received either zoledronic acid or pamidronate. A complete response was defined as CSC ≤ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L).

- **Response or complete response at day 10 in a single-arm, open-label study**: In this study, patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy (CSC levels > 12.5 mg/dL [3.125 mmol/L]) who did not respond to bisphosphonates received denosumab 120 mg s.c. A response was defined as CSC < 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L; CTCAE grade 0 or 1), and a complete response as CSC ≤ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L). ✱ p = 0.002 versus pamidronate.

- **Ethical considerations**: CSC is albumin-corrected serum calcium; CTCAE stands for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) routes were used in different treatments.

More than 90% of patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy can be successfully treated with rehydration and bisphosphonates; however, some patients do not respond or experience relapse on bisphosphonate therapy. Persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy remains challenging to manage. Denosumab, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against RANKL, disrupts signaling through RANK and prevents tumor-mediated activation of osteoclasts. It has been shown to be effective in treating patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation; however, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategies. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking.

Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Hypercalcemia of malignancy and acute pancreatitis [^112BrMNH]. Pancreas (2021). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy confers a poor prognosis. This systematic review evaluated published cases of hypercalcemia of malignancy presenting with acute pancreatitis (AP), in terms of clinical presentation and outcomes.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of PubMed and Embase until March 18, 2020, was conducted. Studies were included if they reported on patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy and AP, with attempts to exclude other etiologies of hypercalcemia and AP. Two independent reviewers selected and appraised studies using the Murad tool.

- **Results**: Thirty-seven cases were identified. The mean (standard deviation) age was 44.8 (2.46) years, and the mean (standard deviation) presenting corrected calcium was 14.5 (0.46) mg/dL. Parathyroid carcinoma (21.6%) and multiple myeloma (21.6%) were the most common malignancies. Cases were classified as severe (37.8%), mild (21.6%), and moderately severe (18.9%), whereas 21.6% did not report severity. Necrotizing pancreatitis developed in 21.6% of cases. Most cases were treated with intravenous hydration and bisphosphonates or calcitonin/calcitonin analogues. Mortality was 32.4% during the same presentation of AP; among mortality cases, 10 of 12 had severe AP, and 5 of 12 had necrotizing pancreatitis. Degree of hypercalcemia did not influence mortality.

- **Conclusion**: Acute pancreatitis associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy is rare. One in three patients with this presentation may not survive AP.

### Ganite [^113QsNFm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Ganite is indicated for the treatment of clearly symptomatic cancer-related hypercalcemia that has not responded to adequate hydration. In general, patients with a serum calcium (corrected for albumin) less than 12 mg/dL would not be expected to be symptomatic. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures, such as saline hydration with or without diuretics.

In the treatment of cancer-related hypercalcemia, it is important first to establish adequate hydration, preferably with intravenous saline, to increase the renal excretion of calcium and correct dehydration caused by hypercalcemia.
