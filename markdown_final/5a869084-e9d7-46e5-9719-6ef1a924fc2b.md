## Question

What is medh vent dyssynchrony and how do we treat it?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "medh vent dyssynchrony" means and how to treat it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "medh" is a typographical error and what the intended term should be. Then, I should define patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and its major subtypes. Next, I will review the clinical consequences, especially lung and diaphragm injury. After that, I should outline a stepwise diagnostic approach, including waveform analysis and adjunct monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize treatment strategies by subtype, consider sedation and neuromuscular blockade, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Medh vent dyssynchrony" does not map to a standard term in the mechanical ventilation literature; wait, let me verify the likely intended phrase. Given context and common ICU usage, this almost certainly refers to "patient-ventilator dyssynchrony", which denotes a mismatch between the patient's neural respiratory timing/effort and the ventilator's delivery across trigger, target, and cycle phases, leading to asynchronous breaths and potentially harmful loading conditions [^111qCBMU] [^116LKBEr].

> I will now define the construct precisely. Patient-ventilator dyssynchrony encompasses several subtypes: ineffective triggering, double triggering, auto-triggering, reverse triggering, premature or delayed cycling, and flow starvation, each reflecting a different phase mismatch and with distinct physiologic consequences. Hold on, I should verify that these are the canonical categories used in contemporary reviews and studies, which they are [^116LKBEr] [^115ZjScr] [^1164Z15G].

> Next, I should review why dyssynchrony matters clinically. Mechanistically, dyssynchrony can amplify lung stress and strain via breath stacking and high transpulmonary pressures, and it can injure the diaphragm through eccentric loading when muscle activation persists into expiration; let me double-check the evidence linking specific patterns to higher tidal volumes and dynamic transpulmonary pressures, which is supported by cohort data showing double triggering, flow-limited, and early reverse-triggered breaths increase Vt and ΔPL, dyn despite low set Vt strategies [^1144pECP] [^117WT7uR] [^111yi3Xf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outcomes. I should confirm the association data. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that overall asynchrony, and particularly ineffective and double triggering, correlate with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay; interestingly, some analyses suggest reverse triggering may not share the same negative association, though causality remains uncertain and heterogeneity is high, so I need to be cautious in overinterpreting this [^116oYNWF] [^111imS4m] [^112hsunK].

> Now, I need to check the diagnostic approach. Bedside waveform inspection of pressure, flow, and volume tracings remains foundational, but I should confirm that expert visual review misses a substantial fraction of events; indeed, more than half of dyssynchronies can be undetected by routine waveform inspection, so adjuncts such as esophageal pressure (Pes) for transpulmonary pressure estimation, electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) for neural timing, and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for regional mechanics and pendelluft can improve detection and phenotyping, especially for reverse triggering and breath stacking [^1163iDU4] [^113vAkF4] [^117TFG6b].

> Let me consider subtype-specific management, starting with ineffective triggering. I should confirm that the usual drivers are dynamic hyperinflation with intrinsic PEEP and over-assistance. Strategies include matching extrinsic PEEP to intrinsic PEEP when appropriate, reducing ventilator assist, and optimizing trigger sensitivity, with attention to underlying obstruction and expiratory flow limitation [^113sEZKB] [^115SWNZ2].

> For double triggering and breath stacking, I need to ensure I'm addressing both timing and volume. Increasing inspiratory time or using decelerating flow to better match neural inspiration, lowering the cycling threshold in pressure support, and, when necessary, increasing set tidal volume modestly to meet demand can reduce stacking; wait, I should verify that breath stacking can deliver supra-target volumes even during "protective" settings, which is well documented and supports active mitigation or, if refractory, neuromuscular blockade to eliminate stacking [^116LKBEr] [^114b4YHV] [^1144pECP].

> Reverse triggering deserves special attention. Let me think about mechanism and risk. Reverse triggering occurs when passive insufflation entrains diaphragmatic effort, often in sedated patients, and can lead to breath stacking and eccentric myotrauma; management ranges from reducing sedation to restore spontaneous control, to using proportional modes that improve neural coupling, to neuromuscular blockade if stacking and injurious efforts persist; I should confirm that low-effort reverse triggering may be diaphragm-sparing in some contexts, whereas high-effort reverse triggering is injurious, which is supported by animal and human data [^115kBKDc] [^116LKBEr] [^111PZ2JC].

> For premature or delayed cycling, I should double-check that adjustments to inspiratory time, flow delivery profile, and cycling-off criteria in pressure support can align mechanical and neural inspiration. Proportional modes such as PAV+ or NAVA can further improve synchrony by adapting assist to patient effort in real time, though availability and signal quality can be limiting factors in some settings [^116LKBEr] [^11296qrL] [^115CPbkm].

> Flow starvation is common in volume-targeted modes with fixed flow. Let me verify that switching to a pressure-targeted mode with decelerating flow or increasing the set flow rate can mitigate this mismatch and reduce dyspnea and accessory muscle use, which aligns with physiologic principles and bedside observations [^116LKBEr] [^1138ZfZs].

> I need to ensure sedation strategy supports synchrony rather than worsens it. Deep sedation can promote reverse triggering and ineffective efforts, whereas light, analgesia-first sedation preserves drive and facilitates ventilator adjustments; opioids may reduce dyspnea and improve synchrony without suppressing consciousness as much as sedatives, but I should confirm that routine opioid infusions can also worsen asynchrony in some contexts, reinforcing the need to titrate to effect and prioritize ventilator optimization first [^116kqe1e] [^1121aWZ2] [^111a4vGm].

> But wait, what if dyssynchrony persists despite these measures and the patient is at high risk of VILI. In early severe ARDS, particularly with P/F ratio less than about 100–150 mmHg, short-course neuromuscular blockade can reduce dyssynchrony, lower transpulmonary pressures, and may improve mortality, albeit with a probable increase in ICU-acquired weakness; I should confirm guideline positions and typical durations, which suggest cisatracurium for up to 48 hours in early severe ARDS when other strategies fail, with prompt de-escalation thereafter [^1164ARDL] [^112eHX7R] [^111rT7ze].

> Let me reconsider the overall framework to ensure internal consistency. The safest approach is to screen continuously for dyssynchrony using waveforms and, when available, Pes/Edi/EIT, classify the dominant subtype, apply mode- and parameter-specific corrections, modulate sedation to preserve appropriate respiratory drive, and escalate to neuromuscular blockade only when indicated and time-limited, all while maintaining lung- and diaphragm-protective targets for effort and transpulmonary pressure [^116LKBEr] [^113vAkF4] [^114CeQC9].

> In summary, I should confirm that "medh vent dyssynchrony" is best interpreted as patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, a common and consequential mismatch between patient effort and ventilator support that increases the risks of lung stress, diaphragm injury, and prolonged ventilation. Management hinges on accurate detection, subtype-specific ventilator adjustments, judicious sedation emphasizing analgesia, and selective, time-limited neuromuscular blockade in high-risk scenarios, with proportional modes offering additional synchrony benefits when available [^111qCBMU] [^116LKBEr] [^1164ARDL].

Medh vent dyssynchrony refers to **mechanical ventilation asynchrony** — a mismatch between patient respiratory effort and ventilator support [^111qCBMU] — causing discomfort, increased work of breathing, and potential lung or diaphragm injury [^114CeQC9]. It includes ineffective triggering, double triggering, auto-triggering, reverse triggering, and flow asynchrony [^115ZjScr] [^1164Z15G]. Management centers on **ventilator adjustments** (trigger sensitivity, flow, cycling, PEEP, mode) [^111qCBMU], sedation optimization [^116kqe1e], and selective neuromuscular blockade for severe cases [^1164ARDL]. Proportional modes (NAVA/PAV) [^112Gj3es] and close waveform monitoring [^113vAkF4] improve synchrony and outcomes [^112r1KAP].

## Types of medh vent dyssynchrony

Several **distinct patterns** of asynchrony are recognized:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Ineffective triggering | Patient effort fails to trigger a breath | - Auto-PEEP <br/> - Weak effort <br/> - High trigger threshold [^115SWNZ2] |
| Double triggering | Two ventilator breaths per patient effort | - Short inspiratory time <br/> - High respiratory drive [^1138ZfZs] |
| Auto-triggering | Ventilator triggers without patient effort | - Leaks <br/> - Cardiac oscillations <br/> - Sensitive trigger [^115SWNZ2] |
| Reverse triggering | Ventilator-initiated breath triggers patient effort | - Sedation <br/> - Controlled ventilation [^112A85aU] |
| Flow asynchrony | Ventilator flow mismatches patient demand | - Fixed flow modes <br/> - High demand [^1138ZfZs] |

---

## Clinical consequences

Medh vent dyssynchrony is associated with **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Increased work of breathing**: Higher respiratory muscle load and fatigue [^111qCBMU].
- **Discomfort and dyspnea**: Poor patient-ventilator interaction [^113ER32f].
- **Prolonged mechanical ventilation**: Delayed weaning and ICU stay [^116oYNWF].
- **Lung injury**: Barotrauma, volutrauma, and atelectrauma from excessive tidal volumes or pressures [^1144pECP].
- **Diaphragm injury**: Eccentric myotrauma from asynchronous contractions [^117WT7uR].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical observation and waveform analysis** [^116VUBrx]. Key methods include:

- **Waveform analysis**: Visual inspection of pressure, flow, and volume tracings for asynchrony patterns [^111qCBMU].
- **Esophageal pressure monitoring**: Assesses transpulmonary pressure and effort [^111Shntn] [^111aUwwU].
- **Electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi)**: Detects neural inspiratory activity and timing [^117HTUqn].
- **Automated detection algorithms**: Software-based tools for continuous asynchrony detection [^115JLN3G].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multimodal approach**:

### Ventilator adjustments

- **Trigger sensitivity**: Adjust to reduce ineffective efforts or auto-triggering [^1138ZfZs] [^113sEZKB].
- **Flow delivery**: Use decelerating flow or proportional modes to match demand [^116LKBEr].
- **Cycling criteria**: Modify inspiratory time to prevent double triggering or premature cycling [^116LKBEr].
- **PEEP optimization**: Counteract auto-PEEP and improve trigger synchrony [^113sEZKB].
- **Mode selection**: NAVA or PAV+ improve synchrony vs. pressure support [^11296qrL] [^115SWNZ2].

---

### Sedation and neuromuscular blockade

Sedation should be **light, analgesia-first** to reduce dyssynchrony while preserving drive [^116kqe1e]. Neuromuscular blockade is reserved for **severe dyssynchrony** that persists despite optimization, especially in ARDS [^1164ARDL].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Address underlying respiratory mechanics, including **obstructive disease** and **auto-PEEP** [^113sEZKB], and manage **respiratory drive** by correcting metabolic disturbances and anxiety [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **proactive strategies**:

- **Regular waveform monitoring**: Early detection and correction [^113vAkF4].
- **Proportional modes**: NAVA or PAV+ to enhance synchrony [^1166VC6Q].
- **Team training**: Educate clinicians on asynchrony recognition and management [^113vAkF4].
- **Individualized ventilation**: Tailor settings to patient mechanics and drive [^112A7GuP].

---

Medh vent dyssynchrony reflects a mismatch between patient effort and ventilator support, with **significant clinical consequences**. Management requires ventilator adjustments, sedation optimization, and selective neuromuscular blockade, with proportional modes and vigilant monitoring to improve synchrony and outcomes [^113vAkF4].

### Reverse triggering, the rhythm dyssynchrony: potential implications for lung and diaphragm protection [^112A85aU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Understanding predisposing factors and clinical effects will be essential to determining the clinical relevance of reverse triggering (injurious and beneficial) and possible management strategies. Modifiable factors such as ventilator settings, respiratory drive, level of consciousness, and prescribed sedatives and opiates may predispose differentially to reverse triggering depending on the mechanism. Regarding clinical significance, some degree of permissive dyssynchrony is probably benign or even beneficial for patients at low risk of lung or diaphragm injury. For patients at highest risk, including those with moderate and severe ARDS, clinical consequences of reverse triggering likely depend on the subtype, duration of exposure, and tradeoffs of interventions such as neuromuscular blockade.

Despite the uncertainties surrounding reverse triggering, the following is clear: a rapidly expanding literature indicates reverse triggering occurs often in mechanically ventilated patients at risk of injury and might be underrecognized at the bedside. What, if anything, should be done clinically remains to be determined.

Invasive and noninvasive phenotyping of RV function — current state of knowledge describes multimodal assessment, noting that comprehensive assessment of the RV requires a combination of RHC and RV imaging via echocardiography or CMR with biomarkers and exercise testing as additional tools; RHC estimates preload, afterload, and contractility, while imaging offers additional information, with both modalities providing estimates of pressures, cardiac output, derived calculations of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial compliance, and indices of RV systolic and diastolic function, dimensions, dyssynchrony, asynchrony, and volumes.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^115SWNZ2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another dyssynchrony occurring in patients with absent or low respiratory drive is auto-triggering, i.e. the delivery of a ventilator-assisted breath in the absence of patient effort. Auto-triggering due to strong cardiac oscillations transmitted to the Paw or airflow signal is more likely to occur when the respiratory system time constant is low, such as in ARDS. Air leaks and moisture in the ventilator circuit are also common causes of auto-triggering.

Ineffective triggering (or ineffective efforts) develops when a patient's effort fails to trigger a ventilator-delivered breath. Ineffective triggering is generally the consequence of weak inspiratory efforts, either from low respiratory drive due to sedation, metabolic alkalosis or excessive ventilatory assist, or because of diaphragm weakness. When the respiratory system time constant is high, (i.e. obstructive lung disease), ventilator over-assistance results in delayed cycling, dynamic hyperinflation, and increased intrinsic PEEP, predisposing to ineffective triggering. Decreasing the level of assist can therefore alleviate ineffective efforts. Over-assistance in assisted ventilation can also induce apneas during sleep.

Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that NAVA improves patient-ventilator interaction, especially reducing the risks of ineffective efforts and over-assist. Whether the reduced duration of mechanical ventilation reported in some NAVA trials results from improved patient-ventilator interaction remains to be investigated.

### Ventilator waveforms and the physiology of pressure support ventilation [^115HpXLR]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a commonly used mode. It is patient-triggered, pressure-limited, and (normally) flow-cycled. Triggering difficulty occurring during PSV is usually due to intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. The airway pressure generated at the initiation of inhalation is determined by the pressure support setting and the pressure rise time (pressurization rate) settings on the ventilator. The rise-time setting is clinician-adjustable on many current-generation ventilators. Flow delivery during PSV is determined by the pressure support setting, the pressure generated by the respiratory muscles, and respiratory system mechanics. The delivered tidal volume is determined by the area under the flow-time curve. Patient-ventilator dyssynchrony may occur during PSV if the flow at which the ventilator cycles to exhalation does not coincide with the termination of neural inspiration. The newer generation ventilators offer clinician-adjustable flow-termination during PSV. Ventilator waveforms may be useful to appropriately adjust the ventilator during PSV.

Continuous assessment and quantification

A major asset of the technique is the possibility to quantify RT continuously with no additional catheter or invasive device. Paw and Flow are readily available on all ventilators, and the system can communicate and capture data from all ventilators for online analysis or subsequent review. Continuous assessment of RT is relevant to identify the changes along the patients' course of mechanical ventilation and to quantify clusters of dyssynchrony that might have an impact on the outcome. It would also allow to obtain reliable epidemiologic data and to examine relationship between RT and treatments or relationship with other biological phenomena in a continuous manner. A few other studies have previously evaluated the accuracy of automatic detections of some types of dyssynchronies but only one evaluated RT. The latter found excellent algorithm performance but only evaluated patients with volume-controlled ventilation for ARDS during a very short period (20 consecutive breaths per patient) with only 27% of the breaths of this validation study having Pes available for the evaluation by a single expert. For the remaining breaths (72.6%) evaluated by a group of 7 experts, they did not reach complete agreement in 27% of the breaths and did not have access to Pes or EAdi signals to confirm their classification.

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several unanswered questions about NMBAs in ARDS. Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also be of benefit in sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is also unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. after a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

Question 4: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Higher Compared with Lower PEEP, with or without LRMs?

Recommendation

We suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H 2 O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Background

Higher PEEP can facilitate alveolar recruitment and prevent cyclic opening/closing injury, which may in turn improve gas exchange by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and reduce lung stress. However, PEEP can also cause injurious overdistension in aerated lung and hemodynamic compromise via increased right ventricular afterload and decreased venous return. The net balance of benefit to harm is reliant on the proportion of recruitment to overdistension in an individual patient. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline previously issued conditional recommendations suggesting higher versus lower PEEP and the use of LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Since that time, several large RCTs evaluating various PEEP strategies have been published. Some have included cointerventions of prolonged LRMs, defined as incremental increases in PEEP to achieve airway pressures ⩾35 cm H 2 O for ⩾60 seconds. Thus, it was important to incorporate these most recent studies into an updated recommendation.

### Cardiac resynchronization for advanced heart failure… [^113GK5vk]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does cardiac resynchronization improve outcomes in patients with moderately severe to severe heart failure. Setting: Inpatient with outpatient follow-up Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Synopsis: Cardiac resynchronization is thought to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and interventricular conduction delay by improving left ventricular systolic function. The authors studied a select subset of patients with heart failure who had a New York Heart Association functional classification of III or IV, an ejection fraction of less than 35 percent, a QRS interval of at least 120 milliseconds, a PR interval of at least 150 milliseconds, sinus rhythm, hospitalization for heart failure within the past year, and no other indication for a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator.

Patients were randomized to receive optimal medical management, optimal medical management plus pacemaker, or optimal medical management plus pacemaker/defibrillator. Allocation concealment was not described, and outcomes were adjudicated by researchers not blinded to treatment assignment. The mean age of the participants was 67 years, two thirds were men, and groups were balanced at the start of the study; analysis was by intention to treat. All-cause mortality was lower in the two pacemaker groups: 19 percent for medication only, 15 percent for pacemaker.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1166VC6Q]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation

Sleep deficiency may impair respiratory function in ICU patients. Several studies in healthy volunteers have shown that respiratory and peripheral muscle endurance is reduced after sleep deprivation and that changes in the chemoreflex control system can occur. In addition, the subjective experience of dyspnea, especially air hunger, can be intensified by sleep deprivation. ICU studies have shown that sleep disturbances are associated with failure to liberate from noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that the degree of wakefulness, as assessed by the odds ratio product, was significantly higher in patients with a successful spontaneous breathing trial.

Relatedly, mechanical ventilation is associated with sleep disruption. Contributing factors to sleep disruption relevant to mechanical ventilation include increased work of breathing, ineffective triggering of the ventilator (i.e. patient–ventilator asynchronies), and ventilatory over-assistance (Figure 3). Several studies describe sleep improvements attributable to the optimization of ventilator settings. In patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, sleep quality was improved when patients were supported by noninvasive ventilatory support at night. Respiratory muscle rest using pressure control ventilation titrated to achieve passive ventilation was found to improve sleep quality, efficiency, and REM sleep compared with low-pressure support. However, ventilatory support in excess of a patient's metabolic need can result in hyperventilation, decreased carbon dioxide concentrations, and central apneas; central apneas can in turn result in frequent awakenings and arousals, leading to sleep fragmentation. Proportional modes of ventilation (e.g. proportional assist ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist) can be used to deliver pressure proportional to the patient's instantaneous efforts in terms of amplitude and timing, which avoids over- and under-assistance and improves synchrony. Proportional assist ventilation has been shown to decrease patient–ventilator dyssynchrony and improve sleep quality because of the combined effects of fewer arousal per hour, fewer awakenings per hour, and greater proportion of REM sleep, though this result is not consistent across studies. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist has been shown to be superior to pressure support ventilation, resulting in increased REM and lesser sleep fragmentation, possibly because of a lack of ineffective efforts or central apnea events.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^116LKBEr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Resolving dyssynchrony

Patient-ventilator dyssynchronies may cause lung and/or diaphragm injury by increasing dynamic lung stress and/or injurious diaphragmatic contractions, respectively. Dyssynchronies may occur during inspiration (flow starvation, short cycles, prolonged insufflation and reverse triggering), during expiration (auto-triggering, ineffective effort) or both during inspiration and expiration (reverse triggering and double triggering). We will briefly discuss dyssynchronies most relevant for lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation; for more extensive discussion of dyssynchronies we refer to other reviews.

Reverse triggering, a diaphragmatic contraction triggered by mechanical inflation, is common in fully sedated patients (in whom drive is abolished). Reverse triggering can induce breath stacking resulting in excessive tidal volumes and high dynamic lung stress, and it may create eccentric diaphragm loading conditions with resultant muscle injury. When necessary to avoid breath stacking, reverse triggering can be abolished by neuromuscular blocking agents. Alternatively, the development of reverse triggering may indicate that sedation should be stopped to allow the patient to take control of ventilation.

In patients with relatively high respiratory drive and a low respiratory system time constant, the neural inspiration time may exceed the mechanical inflation (premature cycling). In such cases, the contraction of the inspiratory muscles continues during mechanical expiration and the diaphragm is forced to contract while lengthening (eccentric contraction). In volume-targeted modes, unmet high demands appear as 'flow-starvation', a downward curvature of inspiratory Paw, and the patient may experience dyspnea and distress, which can be resolved by increasing inspiratory flow rate using a decelerating flow pattern. Strong inspiratory efforts may result in double-triggering, breath stacking and, therefore, delivery of high tidal volumes. A better match of mechanical and neural inspiratory time can be achieved by increasing ventilator inspiratory time and using a decelerating flow pattern in volume-assist control mode, by decreasing the cycling-off criterion in pressure support mode, or using proportional modes of assist. Importantly, in patients with high respiratory drive, modification of inspiratory time may not suffice to resolve dyssynchrony. Increasing the level of assist to match the patient's demands should be considered, but, if that results in an injurious high ventilation, other means to decrease the patient's respiratory drive, such as sedation, may be required.

### Physiology of the respiratory drive in ICU patients: implications for diagnosis and treatment [^112NPn6M]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Diaphragm Load-Induced Injury

In non-ventilated patients, excessive inspiratory loading can result in diaphragm fatigue and injury as demonstrated by sarcomere disruption in diaphragm biopsies. Whether this occurs in critically ill ventilated patients is less clear, although we have reported evidence of diaphragm injury, including sarcomere disruption. The concept of load-induced diaphragm injury may explain recent ultrasound findings demonstrating increased diaphragm thickness during the course of mechanical ventilation in patients with high inspiratory efforts. In addition to high breathing effort, patient-ventilator dyssynchronies, especially eccentric (lengthening) contractions, may promote load-induced diaphragm injury. Whether eccentric contractions are sufficiently severe and frequent to contribute to diaphragm injury in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is not yet known.

Weaning and Extubation Failure

During ventilator weaning, high ventilatory demands with high respiratory drive increase dyspnea, which is associated with anxiety and impacts weaning outcome. "Air hunger" is probably the most distressing form of dyspnea sensation, which occurs in particular when inspiratory flow rate is insufficient ("flow starvation"), or when tidal volumes are decreased under mechanical ventilation while the PaCO 2 level is held constant. In patients with decreased respiratory muscle strength and excessive respiratory drive, the muscle's ability to respond to neural demands is insufficient; dyspnea is then characteristically experienced as a form of excessive breathing effort. Activation of accessory respiratory muscles was found to be strongly related to the intensity of dyspnea, and can lead to weaning and/or extubation failure. In addition, dyspnea impacts ICU outcome and may contribute to ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorders.

Consequences of Low Respiratory Drive

In ventilated patients, a low respiratory drive due to excessive ventilator assistance and/or sedation is a critical contributor to diaphragm weakness. The effects of diaphragm inactivity have been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro in the form of myofibrillar atrophy and contractile force reduction. Diaphragm weakness is associated with prolonged ventilator weaning and increased risks of ICU readmission, hospital readmission, and mortality. In addition, low respiratory drive can lead to patient-ventilator dyssynchronies, such as ineffective efforts, central apneas, auto-triggering, and reverse triggering. Excessive ventilator assistance may result in dynamic hyperinflation, particularly in patients with obstructive airway diseases. Dynamic hyperinflation reduces respiratory drive and promotes ineffective efforts (i.e. a patient's effort becomes insufficient to overcome intrinsic PEEP). Although asynchronies have been associated with worse outcome, whether this is a causal relationship requires further investigation.

Role of prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade and corticosteroids

Prone positioning leads to a relieve of severe hypoxemia due to reduction of overinflated lung areas, promoting of alveolar recruitment and decreasing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. The Proning Severe ARDS Patients (PROSEVA) trial, performed by Guerin et al. demonstrated a significant decrease in 28-day and 90-day mortality in patients with severe ARDS. Prone positioning has been advocated in intubated patients with CARDS. Pan et al. demonstrated increased lung recruitability and PaO2/FiO2 improvement after prone positioning in patients with moderate CARDS. The main obstacle continues to be its implementation and generalization among each institution. Trained and qualified nursing and respiratory therapy staff is the most important factor to obtain successful results, as severe life-threatening events may occur at any given time (self-extubation, hemodynamic instability, lack of adequate sedation, pressure ulcers).

In regards to neuromuscular blockade, in an effort to avoid ventilator dyssynchrony, adjust tidal volumes and decrease airway resistance with the goal to decrease lung parenchyma inflammation, neuromuscular blocking agents were introduced as part of the alternative therapies for severe ARDS. No formal clinical trial or body of evidence has been published yet regarding the use of neuromuscular blockade in patients with CARDS. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends the use of intermittent doses of neuromuscular blocking agents to facilitate lung protective ventilation in COVID-19 patients.

In regards to inflammatory attenuators for patients with CARDS, the RECOVERY trial, a large multicenter, randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that patients in the intervention group (receiving Dexamethasone 6 mg for 10 days, either enterally or intravenously) reduced death by up to one-third in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory complications from COVID-19. The effect seemed to be more prominent in patients on mechanical ventilation (number needed to treat: 8) and intermediate in those who required supplemental oxygen only (number needed to treat: 25). The trial did not show any benefit from Dexamethasone in patients who did not required respiratory support.

Weaning

When applied during the spontaneous breathing trial, monitoring regional TIV, de-recruitment and regional inhomogeneities may inform about weaning success. For instance, a reduction in EELI, higher global inhomogeneity index and pendelluft have been associated with spontaneous breathing trial and/or extubation failure. The predictive role of these parameters to guide weaning remains to be assessed.

Patient-ventilator interaction

Utilizing the temporal and spatial ventilation distribution information, EIT enables patient-ventilator interaction monitoring and dyssynchronies diagnosis. When combined with flow and/or airway pressure signals, the regional impact of dyssynchronies can be quantified, e.g. in terms of ventilation distribution and regional overdistension.

Pendelluft

Pendelluft, is 'the volume of gas passing back and forth between two pathways' and the consequence of inhomogeneities in regional resistances and/or compliances. EIT revealed the occurrence of pendelluft which was correlated with regional inflammation; both could be modulated by PEEP. Negative associations with outcome have been reported but the causal clinical impact remains to be investigated.

EIT is the only technique capable of identifying pendelluft in real-time. Pendelluft measurements during spontaneous breathing have been used to: (1) describe how different ventilatory settings may affect regional time constants, regional resistances and compliances, (2) describe the air movement between dependent and non-dependent lung regions during inspiration, and (3) compute the difference between global and regional redistribution of gas during the respiratory cycles. Various EIT-based definitions/computations have been proposed in different scenarios (Additional file 2).

Newer techniques for weaning include advanced closed loop ventilation modes, such as proportional assist ventilation (PAV) and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). Both of which are proprietary and not available on all ventilator brands. PAV uses the Equation of Motion (P airway − P musc = Flow · Resistance + Volume/Compliance + PEEP) to estimate work of breathing during each breath. Clinicians dictate the percent work of breathing per breath that they wish the ventilator to perform. In NAVA, an esophageal probe measures the electrical activity of the diagram, which allows the clinician to titrate the level of pressure the ventilator delivers per patient effort. These advanced ventilatory modes have been compared favorably to more traditional pressure support trials and can be helpful in determining if the patient is ready for extubation. In a systematic review of studies comparing closed loop ventilation modes to the traditional pressure support, utilization of NAVA was associated with lower in-hospital and ICU mortality as well as a lower likelihood of NIPPV use in the first 48 hours after extubation. Meanwhile, PAV utilization was associated with a higher likelihood of successful liberation from the ventilator, shorter IMV duration, and ICU length of stay.

Regardless of the modality chosen, it is critical that a readiness assessment and SBT, if the patient is eligible, be conducted daily. For the CICU patient that fails their SBT, they should immediately be placed on a non-fatiguing ventilator mode (typically set to volume/pressure-control or pressure support, as per European guidelines), which minimizes work of breathing and ventilator dyssynchrony.

### Neurally adjusted non-invasive ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does patient-ventilator synchrony matter? [^116D1YZ6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

A lot of emphasis has been placed recently on the problem of patient–ventilator interaction during non-invasive ventilation (NIV). This issue is particularly important in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

In their elegant study, Doorduin and colleagues show that the use of non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) improved patient–ventilator synchrony compared with pressure support ventilation (PSV), delivered either by a dedicated NIV platform or by an ICU ventilator with dedicated software. Indeed, they demonstrated that automated analysis of ventilator pressure and diaphragm electrical activity waveforms allowed an objective detection of patient–ventilator interaction.

This study largely confirmed the results already described in other investigations performed in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients. There is no doubt nowadays that NAVA is the most effective mode of improving the synchrony between patient and machine, but the key question for the clinician is whether or not this will make a difference to the patient's outcome.

In other words, does patient–ventilator synchrony matter? In invasively ventilated patients, a high incidence of asynchrony is associated with a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and a higher rate of tracheotomy during assisted mechanical ventilation. This association was mainly due to a nonappropriate setting of the ventilator parameters (that is, a high inspiratory pressure or a less sensitive trigger), rather than the patient's clinical severity or ventilatory modes. A higher discomfort in patients receiving NIV for acute and even chronic respiratory failure was reported, but apparently did not influence gas exchange or any other clinical parameter. Comfort is a main goal to achieve during NIV since it may determine the tolerance of the patient, which is still one of the main causes of NIV failure and therefore of intubation. NIV is a semi-open system and air leaks around the mask are very likely to occur, particularly in the first few hours of ventilation when the patient needs to adapt to this non-natural breathing. Air leaks are the major cause of poor synchrony during NIV and therefore dedicated NIV platforms and ICU ventilators using a specific module have been developed to minimize this problem. In vivo and bench assessment showed that these ventilators, particularly the former, are able to almost avoid the occurrence of mismatching. In contrast, the study by Doorduin and colleagues showed a considerable amount of dyssynchrony especially using the NIV platform during PSV.

Ventilatory dyssynchrony

Patient–ventilator dyssynchronies are common during mechanical ventilation and are usually related to adverse events such as weaning prolongation and increased mortality. Despite this, the vast majority of dyssynchronies (more than 60%) remain undetected by experts on inspection of ventilator waveforms. In this scenario, the information contained in the EIT plethysmogram may assist the intensivist in the early identification of potentially harmful dyssynchronies, such as breath stacking and pendelluft.

Breath stacking is usually secondary to reverse triggering or double-triggering, when a second respiratory cycle is imposed by the ventilator on top of an incomplete exhalation. Figure 9 shows airway pressure, flow, and volume (found in the mechanical ventilator) and EIT waveforms during a synchronous cycle (A) and during breath stacking dyssynchrony (B). During breath stacking, the volume waveform shows an inspired volume of approximately 8 ml/kg of predicted weight; however, the inspired volume detected by EIT is nearly twice that of a regular cycle, which indicates injurious deformation of the lung.

Pendelluft is an intrapulmonary dyssynchrony described in the presence of intense diaphragmatic contraction, in which there is gas movement between different pulmonary regions (Fig. 10). Pendelluft causes tidal recruitment of dependent regions (local atelectrauma) by concomitant deflating nondependent regions. This transferred volume also causes excessive stretching of the alveoli in the dependent region (local volutrauma). Both injurious mechanisms worsen local pulmonary inflammation. This regionally amplified transpulmonary pressure due to a strong inspiratory effort is usually undetected. The clinical hazard related to such amplification effect is "hidden" as the ventilators only measure airway-opening pressures. Only EIT is capable of detecting, tracking, locating, and quantifying pendelluft continuously and at the bedside.

Analgesics, sedatives, and neuromuscular blocking agents — introduction for ICU management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — emphasizes supportive indications and physiologic rationale: analgesics and sedatives are needed for comfort and tolerance; neuromuscular blocking agents are not needed routinely except at rapid sequence intubation or when severe acute lung injury mechanics complicate ventilation; appropriate analgesia and sedation mitigate pain or distress and patient–ventilator dyssynchrony that may result in episodic rise in CBV and raise ICP, and routine care while the patient is awake or aware may lead to unanticipated rises in ICP; pediatric practice is limited by the small number of sedative/analgesics and differs from adult practice, particularly given the frequent adult use of propofol, which in pediatrics has a U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning.

### Automated patient-ventilator interaction analysis during neurally adjusted non-invasive ventilation and pressure support ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1158kx4U]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) plays an important role in managing patients with acute respiratory failure, in particular in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In patients with acute hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD, NIV improves outcome. Accordingly, NIV utilization has increased over time among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, whereas the need for intubation has declined. Despite these positive reports, some patients treated with NIV fail and require invasive mechanical ventilation. Poor patient-ventilator interaction may contribute to NIV failure. Delivering synchronous non-invasive assist is challenging with flow- or pressure-controlled systems, especially when using excessively leaky or highly compliant interfaces. Using ventilators not dedicated to NIV, up to 46% of patients exhibit severe asynchrony. The introduction of dedicated NIV ventilators and NIV algorithms in ICU ventilators improved patient-ventilator interaction, yet their performance varies and the inherent limitations of using flow or pressure to control assist remain.

As recommended, patient-ventilator interaction can be evaluated by using the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi). Besides its monitoring capabilities, EAdi is used during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) as a controller signal for ventilatory assist. Recent studies in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients show that non-invasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA) improves patient-ventilator interaction relative to non-invasive pressure support ventilation (NIV-PSV).

To our knowledge, there are no studies of patient-ventilator interaction strictly in COPD patients receiving NIV-NAVA, while these patients are more likely to exhibit severe patient ventilator asynchrony. In addition, no study has used the EAdi signal to evaluate patient-ventilator interaction with dedicated NIV ventilators. Moreover, a new automated analysis method has recently been introduced in this journal for quantifying patient-ventilator interaction in a standardized fashion. This automated analysis allows detection of asynchronies, such as wasted efforts, but also makes it easy to detect the more subtle dyssynchronies, such as trigger delays and cycling-off errors. The present study is the first to use this analysis method to quantify patient-ventilator interaction during non-invasive ventilation.

For the above-stated reasons, the aim of the present study was to evaluate patient-ventilator interaction, using an automated analysis, in COPD patients with NIV-PSV delivered by a dedicated NIV ventilator, and NIV-PSV and NIV-NAVA delivered by an ICU ventilator.

### Fundamentals of aerosol therapy in critical care [^1143B3gz]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Breath characteristics

Ventilator breath characteristics have an important effect on the efficacy of aerosol delivery. Slower inspiratory flows, long inspiratory times and tidal volumes > 500 mL (using a pMDI) correlate well with improved aerosol delivery. Higher bias flow is seen to reduce the delivery efficacy of nebulizers. Decelerating flow pattern is considered inferior to constant flow pattern for drug delivery. The effect of ventilation mode is negligible for pMDIs. The delivery efficiency in patients on NIV is seen to be comparatively less. However, it must be remembered that specific techniques of ventilation may in themselves produce a greater benefit than the relative detriment of drug delivery (e.g. in NIV and asthma). Hence, in acute asthma, NIV plus nebulization is more effective than nebulization alone.

A prescribed ventilatory pattern may not be practical in the critically ill patient. The most effective combination of tidal volume, flow and other ventilator parameters for aerosol delivery can be calibrated to the drug and delivery device using in-vitro models.

Significance — Tidal volumes > 500 mL may enhance aerosolized drug delivery. NIV results in effective therapy despite reduced drug delivery in conditions like asthma. Ventilator settings optimal for nebulization, however, could lead to patient–ventilator dyssynchrony in severely hypoxemic patients (e.g. due to severe pneumonia) — thus requiring deep sedation, which may increase the duration of MV.

Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a commonly used ventilator setting as part of the lung protective ventilatory strategy in severe lung diseases. PEEP has significant effects on regional ventilation and perfusion and hence could influence the PK of an aerosolized drug. In an animal model using radiotracers, PEEP was found to enhance aerosol clearance. This could be due to the stretching of the alveolar epithelium and enhancing the distribution of aerosol into the bloodstream.

Significance — PEEP is potentially beneficial, although further data are needed to quantify the effect on aerosolized drug delivery.

Airway pressure release ventilation

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is an alternative mode of mechanical ventilation used to treat refractory hypoxemia and ARDS. APRV is a pressure-limited mode that cycles between two levels of CPAP. A higher airway pressure (P-high) is set for a certain time (T -high) and a lower airway pressure (P -low) (often set at 0 cm H 2 O) is set for a shorter time (T -low). APRV utilizes an inverted inspiration:expiration ratio, as the majority of spontaneous breathing is accomplished during T -high, with the higher pressure P -high theoretically allowing for recruitment of collapsed alveoli, and T -low allowing for ventilation and complete exhalation. The proposed benefits to APRV include allowing for spontaneous breathing, decreased work of breathing, and less dyssynchrony (and therefore less use of sedatives and paralytics). It is also thought that higher mean airway pressures may improve oxygenation when compared to more conventional modes of mechanical ventilation. While APRV may increase mean airway pressures there is less control over tidal volume and minute ventilation. Some patients may also require deep sedation and/or paralysis, thereby eliminating spontaneous breathing, compromising adequate ventilation. These issues may be overcome using time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV), where T-low is set to terminate at 75% of the expiratory flow peak, maintaining adequate alveolar inflation during the release phase. If a patient requires a higher minute ventilation, T -high is reduced to increase the frequency of releases while T -low remains set based on expiratory flow dynamics. Despite its use in ARDS, high quality evidence favoring APRV is lacking, and the available studies reported mixed results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies found that use of APRV in critically ill adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was associated with improved mortality and oxygenation, although the studies were small, single-center studies. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of six studies with 375 patients found that APRV was associated with improved oxygenation and decreased ICU length of stay, but had no effect on mortality. More recently, a randomized controlled trial of 90 adult patients with COVID-19 related ARDS compared APRV to conventional low tidal volume ventilation and found that APRV was not associated with improvements in ventilator-free days or mortality. Larger, multicenter, randomized studies are needed to further clarify if APRV is beneficial in patients with severe ARDS (or in ARDS subgroups) compared with conventional ventilation.

### Asynchrony: clinical relevance, detection, and resolution [^115SVwsY]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient-ventilator asynchrony is defined as a mismatch between the patient's intrinsic timing of inspiratory and expiratory efforts and the ventilator's insufflation and exhalation, reflecting a discrepancy between the patient's needs and the support delivered by the ventilator. Although asynchrony is frequently observed in mechanically ventilated patients, it remains unclear whether patient-ventilator asynchrony directly contributes to adverse outcomes, under what conditions some degree of asynchrony may be tolerated or beneficial, and how this knowledge should guide clinical management. The relationship between asynchronies and clinical outcomes is complex, influenced by multiple factors that may act as mechanisms of harm or benefit. These include the timing of asynchrony (ie, during inspiration or expiration), the magnitude of patient effort, ventilator mode or settings, and patient-specific factors such as lung compliance. Importantly, patient-ventilator asynchrony can also serve as a marker of a patient's underlying clinical condition, offering insight into the patient's respiratory drive. Some forms of asynchrony are associated with high respiratory drive, whereas others occur in the context of low drive or overassistance. This review outlines the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of patient-ventilator asynchronies. It also offers practical strategies for bedside detection and management and highlights future directions to improve recognition and resolution of patient-ventilator asynchrony in clinical practice.

### Dyspnea and mechanical ventilation: the emperor has No clothes [^111a4vGm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For the past 20 years, with the report of the ARDSNet (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network) study, critical care physicians have assiduously adhered to a low-Vstrategy, sometimes necessitating permissive hypercapnia and acute respiratory acidosis, to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury not only for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome but for most patients with acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation. The restriction of Vin patients with acute lung disease and a strong drive to breathe is likely to cause an intense sense of "air hunger". Management of the ventilator in these patients may also be complicated by dyssynchrony. Although there are multiple types of dyssynchrony associated with different mechanisms, patient discomfort may play a role. Of those individuals who survive mechanical ventilation, a significant percentage will have emotional and behavioral problems, including symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in the months and years after extubation, and a case has been made for dyspnea as a contributing factor for this outcome.

Sedation is commonly used to treat patients with acute respiratory failure, often triggered by apparent discomfort. When selecting medications, however, we need to distinguish drugs such as benzodiazepines, which may be anxiolytics but have little effect on dyspnea, from analgesics, such as opiates, which will reduce the intensity of dyspnea. Although an individual may be unconscious with sedation, experimental studies with propofol suggest that painful stimuli may still be "perceived", as evidenced by activation of the insular cortex, a part of the limbic system in which noxious experiences are processed, on brain imaging.

Can we assess dyspnea in a patient who is mechanically ventilated? Dyspnea, as with any symptom, is ideally reported by the individual. Yet, we suspect that unconscious patients can perceive pain based on their behavior (e.g. withdrawing from a noxious stimulus) and on the results of neural imaging. With respect to dyspnea, clinicians frequently make inferences from findings on physical exam that indicate "respiratory distress", although these findings are generally reflecting an increase in respiratory drive (e.g. use of accessory muscles of ventilation or nasal flaring). Validated instruments have been developed to incorporate facial expressions and associated clinical observations into the assessment of dyspnea in patients unable to communicate directly. Furthermore, patients with endotracheal tubes in place may not be able to speak, but often they can communicate in other ways if we would just ask the question.

### Mechanical ventilation: past lessons and the near future [^113d5n9z]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The importance of improved monitoring and mode flexibility became evident throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as laboratory and clinical investigations revealed the full potential for the ventilator to cause both obvious and hidden forms of lethal injury. Awareness of the key roles of maximum transalveolar pressure and high tidal volume led to the approach of accepting higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (permissive hypercapnia) as a necessary consequence of using smaller and safer tidal volumes to support, first, intubated asthmatics and later those with ARDS. High-frequency jet ventilation and high-frequency oscillation were developed and tested as strategies for limiting the lung-damaging potential of maximum tidal pressure while recruiting the unstable lung units of infants with infant respiratory distress syndrome. Although jet ventilators were available early on, adult use of high-frequency oscillation awaited the development of capable machines in the late 1990s. Inhalation of vasodilatory gas mixtures (nitric oxide) that promoted gas exchange through patent lung units first gained popularity in the 1990s.

Pressure-regulated modes of ventilation (pressure support, pressure control, and their modern variants) were developed to address with relative safety the varying flow demands of the patient with cardiopulmonary disease. The ability to respond to the patient's changing flow demands, as well as the need to cycle in timely fashion into the exhalation phase, was introduced to machinery developed in the mid-1970s in the form of pressure support (pressure support ventilation). At first, time-cycled pressure control (pressure control ventilation) was often implemented as inverse-ratio ventilation in the treatment of ARDS, an approach that has since faded from favor. In contrast, pressure support, assist-control, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with either flow-controlled or pressure-controlled breaths have become entrenched as the flexible standard modes of ventilation for more than 30 years.

Observational studies and clinical trials testing the worth of traditional and innovative approaches to lung protection and gas exchange efficiency characterized scientific efforts in mechanical ventilation through the 1990s and into the first decade of the 21st century. Current-generation technology has responded admirably to emerging knowledge concerning iatrogenic upper airway damage, lung parenchymal injury, and the consequences of dys-synchrony. Present-day approaches - for example, proportional assist ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist - are immeasurably more effective than before, but still need to eliminate imperfect integration with the patient's neural demands and underlying physiologic needs. Safety and coordination remain the frontiers for scientific investigation and technological development in this field.

### Regional distribution of acoustic-based lung vibration as a function of mechanical ventilation mode [^117WqK8o]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Patients who are mechanically ventilated may demonstrate ventilator dysynchrony, in which the desired breathing patterns do not match the ventilator and patient discomfort occurs. Among the three modes, PS is the closest to spontaneous breathing in that the patient controls the length of inspiration and RR and, in turn, the V T and inspiratory flow rate are more adaptable to the patient's own ventilatory demand.

The physiologic explanation for the increase in vibration in the lower lungs during PS in our study could be the increase in diaphragm-generated negative intrapleural pressure during inspiration. Evidence has accumulated that diaphragmatic displacements during spontaneous and mechanical breaths are different. The increased use of muscles of inspiration in modes that are more amenable to this interaction, such as PC and PS (in which inspiratory flow is affected by the degree of inspiratory muscle activity), could produce increased vibrations in lower lung fields due to increased diaphragm activity. Because this effect was also observed in PC, in which the breaths above a set rate were not different than with VC, it is unlikely to be a 'triggering'-produced effect only. Although ventilator-triggered breaths were not differentiated from the patient-triggered breaths in VC and PC, the lack of difference in breaths above a set rate between these two modes supports this premise. In VC, ventilated patients have limited capability to produce effects on inspiration other than changing frequency (no changes in inspiratory flow with changes in inspiratory muscle activity). In PS and PC, increased diaphragm activity increases flow. Among the types of mechanical ventilation breaths tested here, PS most mirrors spontaneous breathing. Spontaneous breaths are associated with a predominant movement of the posterior diaphragm, which contains more muscle fibers, whereas controlled mechanical breaths cause diaphragm displacement mainly in the anterior diaphragm. Most of the lung is seated on this dorsal region of the diaphragm. It would be anticipated that diaphragm activity would be greatest with PS (greatest patient interaction), least with VC (least patient interaction with synchronous ventilation), and intermediate with PC (in which patient diaphragm activity can influence flow). This gradation of anticipated diaphragm activity is consistent with our results.

### Noninvasive pressure support versus proportional assist ventilation in acute respiratory failure [^111gJsNk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although conventional pressure ventilation (PSV) decreases the rate of intubation in acute respiratory failure, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is a frequent cause of failure. In proportional assist ventilation (PAV), pressure is applied by the ventilator in proportion to the patient-generated volume and flow; therefore, there is automatic synchrony between the patient's effort and the ventilatory cycle.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of PSV and PAV during noninvasive ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure.

Design

Prospective randomised study.

Setting

A multidisciplinary 24-bed intensive care unit of an acute-care teaching hospital in Alicante, Spain. PATIENTS. This study included 117 consecutive adult patients with acute respiratory failure randomised to noninvasive ventilation delivered by PSV (n = 59) or PAV (n = 58).

Measurements and Results

There were no statistically significant differences between patients assigned to each mode of ventilation with regard to baseline parameters and aetiological diagnoses of acute respiratory failure. With regard to outcome data, no significant differences were observed between PSV and PAV in the frequency of intubation (37% vs 34%), mortality rate (29% vs 28%), and mean length of stay. Subjective comfort (0–10 visual analogue scale) was rated higher and intolerance occurred less frequently (3.4% vs 15%, P = 0.03) in the PAV than in the PSV mode.

Conclusions

Although PAV seems more comfortable and intolerance occurred less frequently, no major differences exist in terms of physiological improvement or in terms of outcomes when comparing PSV and PAV.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^116rhYsZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, ventilator mode is an important covariate. The results of the included studies and the results are presented in Appendix I. Future studies should account for these confounding factors. This includes the recommendation that future studies should also investigate whether asynchrony is common in certain groups of patients.

Second, the presence of heterogeneity among the included studies in this review should be taken into account, particularly within the studies included in the meta-analysis that investigated the association between asynchrony and clinical outcome measures. All the studies in the meta-analysis used the AI. However, methodological variation exist in the determination of asynchrony, ranging from continuous software-based measurements to manual analysis of flow, pressure, and volume curves over different time intervals. Additionally, heterogeneity is observed in the types of asynchrony considered among the studies in the meta-analysis. Specifically, the inclusion of different types of asynchronies in the calculation of the AI contributes to this heterogeneity. Furthermore, variations in asynchrony occurrence between day and night contribute to the observed heterogeneity. Based on these findings, we recommend that in future studies only continuous monitoring of PVA should be considered.

### Navigating hypoxemic respiratory failure in critically ill cardiac patients [^116gDGSS]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiologically, volutrauma, atelectotrauma, and barotrauma all increase concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and may perpetuate ongoing multi-organ failure. The inflammatory cascade of CS is profound and a growing area of exploration in CS management. Optimization of tidal volumes to minimize secondary sources of inflammation may provide an additional avenue for therapeutic benefit. Conversely, permissive hypercapnia from LTVV can cause acidosis, a myocardial depressant, so acid-base status should be monitored. Currently, LTVV is recommended for intubated patients with CS mostly based on expert opinionwith no randomized trial data yet showing benefit.

Lung protective ventilation aims to minimize the risk of ventilator-associated lung and diaphragm injury. Another major cause of ventilator-associated lung injury remains patient-ventilator dyssynchrony. Asynchrony can occur at each stage of breath triggering, delivery, and termination. Patient ventilation dyssycnhrony is associated with worse clinical outcomes and in some cases contributes to ongoing lung injury. Strategies to minimize dyssychrony include changing ventilation parameters to match patient demand, optimizing sedation and occasionally, paralysis. A full overview of all patient-ventilator dyssycnhrony has been well covered in prior reviews.

### Neuromuscular blockade in ARDS | NEJM resident 360… [^111rT7ze]. resident360.nejm.org (2019). Medium credibility.

2: FIO 2 ratio of 100. We placed her on low-tidal volume ventilation and despite increasing propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses, she kept "bucking the vent". The patient also had hypoxemia refractory to positive end-expiratory pressure and Fio 2 titration. The decision was made to add an infusion of cisatracurium, a neuromuscular blocking agent, to maximize her oxygenation by decreasing metabolic demand and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and in turn, reduce the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury. Cisatracurium is one of the few pharmacologic agents that was thought to improve mortality in ARDS, based on the ACURASYS trial conducted about 10 years ago.

The results indicated that early NMB use was associated with significantly improved 90-day survival, when compared with placebo, in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, early NBM blockade was never widely adopted because it requires deep sedation and the effect on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes is uncertain. Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups. Although these results may prove to be an epitaph for routine early NMB use in ARDS, editorialists argue that NMB agents can sometimes be used when physiologically indicated, as in the patient described above. Comment: The high mortality seen in this study is perplexing. Some people have proposed that higher PEEP was not helpful but potentially harmful.

Despite this, the results mean that patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS should not be treated uniformly with early NMB. However, I agree with the editorialists' position that NMB still should be considered on an individual basis, particularly for patients with ventilator dyssynchrony. In other patients, early, "moderate-to-severe" ARDS might resolve relatively quickly, mitigating the need for NMB and the downsides of deep sedation.

### Reverse triggering during controlled ventilation: from physiology to clinical management [^115kBKDc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Reverse triggering dyssynchrony is a frequent phenomenon recently recognized in sedated critically ill patients under controlled ventilation. It occurs in at least 30–55% of these patients and often occurs in the transition from fully passive to assisted mechanical ventilation. During reverse triggering, patient inspiratory efforts start after the passive insufflation by mechanical breaths. The most often referred mechanism is the entrainment of the patient's intrinsic respiratory rhythm from the brainstem respiratory centers to periodic mechanical insufflations from the ventilator. However, reverse triggering might also occur because of local reflexes without involving the respiratory rhythm generator in the brainstem. Reverse triggering is observed during the acute phase of the disease, when patients may be susceptible to potential deleterious consequences of injurious or asynchronous efforts. Diagnosing reverse triggering might be challenging and can easily be missed. Inspection of ventilator waveforms or more sophisticated methods, such as the electrical activity of the diaphragm or esophageal pressure, can be used for diagnosis. The occurrence of reverse triggering might have clinical consequences. On the basis of physiological data, reverse triggering might be beneficial or injurious for the diaphragm and the lung, depending on the magnitude of the inspiratory effort. Reverse triggering can cause breath-stacking and loss of protective lung ventilation when triggering a second cycle. Little is known about how to manage patients with reverse triggering; however, available evidence can guide management on the basis of physiological principles.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^1114AQU1]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Distribution of diaphragm loading conditions during mechanical ventilation

Edi and estimated Pmus varied substantially among patients and over time (Fig. 1). The observed prevalence of different levels of diaphragm activity and respiratory effort is reported in Additional file 1: Table E2. Edi was low or absent (≤ 5 µV) in 51% of study hours (median 71 h per patient, interquartile range 39–101 h). Edi was elevated (> 20 µV) in 10% of study hours (median 1 h per patient, interquartile range 0–17 h).

Fig. 1
Distribution of diaphragm activity levels and respiratory effort levels during the first week of mechanical ventilation. Left panel: categories of mean hourly diaphragm electrical activity (Edi). Right panel: categories of estimated respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus). Pmus was estimated from the product of hourly diaphragm electrical activity and the daily measurement of neuromuscular coupling

Similar results were obtained with time series spline extrapolation (Additional file 1: Figure E3). The evolution of diaphragm activity over time was similar between patients intubated for acute lung injury in comparison with those intubated for other reasons (Additional file 1: Figure E4).

Burden of exposure to dyssynchrony and post-inspiratory loading during mechanical ventilation

Patient-ventilator dyssynchrony was common during mechanical ventilation and increased with time (Fig. 2). The most common forms of dyssynchrony were premature cycling and reverse triggering (Additional file 1: Figure E5), but patients not infrequently manifested multiple forms of dyssynchrony in the same recordings (Fig. 2). Post-inspiratory loading (restrictive definition) was present in 12.6% of study hours (median 7 h per patient, interquartile range 2–22 h) (Additional file 1: Table E2), and its prevalence increased progressively over time (Fig. 2). In a sensitivity analysis employing a less restrictive (more sensitive) definition of post-inspiratory loading, it was present in 57% of study-hours (Additional file 1: Table E2, Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows representative tracings of post-inspiratory loading during reverse triggering and premature cycling.

### Reverse trigger phenotypes in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114wDy5a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Reverse triggering is an underexplored form of dyssynchrony with important clinical implications in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Objectives: This retrospective study identified reverse trigger phenotypes and characterized their impacts on Vt and transpulmonary pressure. Methods: Fifty-five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome on pressure-regulated ventilator modes were included. Four phenotypes of reverse triggering with and without breath stacking and their impact on lung inflation and deflation were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: Inflation volumes, respiratory muscle pressure generation, and transpulmonary pressures were determined and phenotypes differentiated using Campbell diagrams of respiratory activity. Reverse triggering was detected in 25 patients, 15 with associated breath stacking, and 13 with stable reverse triggering consistent with respiratory entrainment. Phenotypes were associated with variable levels of inspiratory effort (mean 4–10 cm H 2 O per phenotype). Early reverse triggering with early expiratory relaxation increased Vts (88 [64–113] ml) and inspiratory transpulmonary pressures (3 [2–3] cm H 2 O) compared with passive breaths. Early reverse triggering with delayed expiratory relaxation increased Vts (128 [86–170] ml) and increased inspiratory and mean-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (7 [5–9] cm H 2 O and 5 [4–6] cm H 2 O). Mid-cycle reverse triggering (initiation during inflation and maximal effort during deflation) increased Vt (51 [38–64] ml), increased inspiratory and mean-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (3 [2–4] cm H 2 O and 3 [2–3] cm H 2 O), and caused incomplete exhalation. Late reverse triggering (occurring exclusively during exhalation) increased mean expiratory transpulmonary pressure (2 [1–2] cm H 2 O) and caused incomplete exhalation. Breath stacking resulted in large delivered volumes (176 [155–197] ml). Conclusions: Reverse triggering causes variable physiological effects, depending on the phenotype. Differentiation of phenotype effects may be important to understand the clinical impacts of these events.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^111yi3Xf]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-clinical studies suggest that dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions during mechanical ventilation may cause acute diaphragm dysfunction. We aimed to describe the variability in diaphragm contractile loading conditions during mechanical ventilation and to establish whether dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions are associated with the development of impaired diaphragm dysfunction.

Methods

In patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for pneumonia, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute brain injury, airway flow and pressure and diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) were recorded hourly around the clock for up to 7 days. Dyssynchronous post-inspiratory diaphragm loading was defined based on the duration of neural inspiration after expiratory cycling of the ventilator. Diaphragm function was assessed on a daily basis by neuromuscular coupling (NMC, the ratio of transdiaphragmatic pressure to diaphragm electrical activity).

Results

A total of 4508 hourly recordings were collected in 45 patients. Edi was low or absent (≤ 5 µV) in 51% of study hours (median 71 h per patient, interquartile range 39–101 h). Dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading was present in 13% of study hours (median 7 h per patient, interquartile range 2–22 h). The probability of dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading was increased with reverse triggering (odds ratio 15, 95% CI 8–35) and premature cycling (odds ratio 8, 95% CI 6–10). The duration and magnitude of dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading were associated with a progressive decline in diaphragm NMC (p < 0.01 for interaction with time).

Conclusions

Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions may impair diaphragm function during mechanical ventilation.

### Minimizing asynchronies in mechanical ventilation: current and future trends [^113ER32f]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Patient-ventilator asynchrony exists when the phases of breath delivered by the ventilator do not match those of the patient. Asynchronies occur throughout mechanical ventilation and negatively affect patient comfort, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stays, and mortality. Identifying asynchronies requires careful attention to patients and their ventilator waveforms. This review discusses the different types of asynchronies, how they are generated, and their impact on patient comfort and outcome. Moreover, it discusses practical approaches for detecting, correcting, and preventing asynchronies. Current evidence suggests that the best approach to managing asynchronies is by adjusting ventilator settings. Proportional modes improve patient-ventilator coupling, resulting in greater comfort and less dyspnea, but not in improved outcomes with respect to the duration of mechanical ventilation, delirium, or cognitive impairment. Advanced computational technologies will allow smart alerts, and models based on time series of asynchronies will be able to predict and prevent asynchronies, making it possible to tailor mechanical ventilation to meet each patient's needs throughout the course of mechanical ventilation.

### Automated detection and quantification of reverse triggering effort under mechanical ventilation [^116doopw]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient–ventilator dyssynchrony is often associated with poor patient-centered outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality. The causality has not been demonstrated, and it is not clear yet whether and when some types of dyssynchrony can directly cause harm or discomfort, or whether others are simply markers of suboptimal ventilator settings or more severe underlying conditions. Poor patient–ventilator interaction is, however, a major reason for administering sedation in the ICU, and therefore this phenomenon deserves attention and a more granular description than referring to dyssynchrony in general. Of major interest, reverse triggering (RT) is a specific form of dyssynchrony defined by the presence of a respiratory muscle contraction following a passive mechanical insufflation as if the contraction was "triggered by" the ventilator. It has been described in intubated patients receiving sedation under controlled ventilation and seems to be very frequent. This phenomenon might constitute a regular entrainment (phase locking) of the respiratory rhythm to periodic insufflation, as described in animals and healthy humans, but it may also be more irregular and can even occur in brain-dead patients. When the effort generated is strong enough, it induces breath stacking, often misinterpreted to be caused by double triggering (in which the same patient's inspiratory effort would trigger the first and second mechanical insufflation). Reverse triggering could impact patients' outcomes through several mechanisms, such as increased tidal volume during inspiration, breath stacking, or through pendelluft during the inspiratory phase. On the one hand, it can generate diaphragm injury when generating strong eccentric contractions during exhalation, but on the other hand, when small, diaphragmatic contractions related to RT could be beneficial by preventing muscle disuse and atrophy in sedated patients.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1164ARDL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs): We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty). In seven RCTs that included 1,598 patients, NMBAs may decrease mortality versus no NMBA (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; low certainty), with mortality reduction when compared with deep sedation (n = 3 studies, 431 patients; RR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.58–0.91) but not light sedation (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15). NMBAs were probably associated with a reduced incidence of barotrauma (n = 4 studies, 1,437 patients; RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85) and a possible increase in ventilator-free days (n = 5 studies; MD, 0.89 more; 95% CI, 0.38 fewer to 2.18 more), but also probably increased the rates of ICU-acquired weakness (n = 4 studies, 885 patients; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98–1.37). The panel specified timing and severity qualifiers: the balance of benefits might be greatest when treatment is targeted to early (< 48 h since ARDS onset) and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ratio < 100 mm Hg) ARDS; no recommendation could be made for later initiation or less severe ARDS. Although this guideline does not recommend a specific NMBA, cisatracurium was used in the two largest RCTs and was noted as possibly preferable; with regard to duration, NMBAs were administered for as long as 48 hours in the majority of study patients, and NMBA duration should be limited to a maximum of 48 hours whenever possible; an appropriate strategy may involve reserving use for early severe ARDS in deeply sedated patients or, under light sedation, when significant ventilator dyssynchrony or clinical deterioration persists despite ventilator or sedation adjustments.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^113TMshk]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

Between January 2014 and January 2020, 209 patients were screened and found to be potentially eligible (Additional file 1: Figure E2). Of these, 49 were enrolled, including 5 patients by deferred consent. Two participants enrolled by deferred consent asked to withdraw from study participation upon regaining capacity and were excluded from analysis; two additional patients were excluded from analysis because very few recordings with acceptable quality were obtained, leaving 45 patients for analysis.

Monitoring was initiated within a median of 23 h after intubation (interquartile range 18–33 h, range 4–42 h). The median duration of monitoring in the study was 5 days (IQR 3–7 days). A total of 4508 hourly recordings were collected (median 105 study-hours per participant, IQR 48–141 study-hours per participant). After appraising signal quality, 3669 hourly recordings were accepted for analysis. Data could be imputed for an additional 389 study hours (total 4058 study-hours for analysis). After extrapolating Edi, Pmus, dyssynchrony rates, and post-inspiratory loading from all available data to hours in the first 48 h after intubation when these measurements were not obtained, measurements for analysis were available for 5102 patient-hours. NMC measurements were obtained in 41 patients, allowing Pmus to be estimated for 4918 patient-hours.

Clinical characteristics of study participants at baseline are reported in Table 1. Most participants were intubated for pneumonia or septic shock; a minority were intubated for acute brain injury. One patient was transferred out of the ICU to another hospital before extubation and was lost to follow-up. Thirty-one patients (67%) survived to extubation and ICU discharge. The median duration of ventilation was 5 days (IQR 3–10 days).

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112Gj3es]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation — sleep disruption evidence indicates that ICU sleep disturbances are associated with failure to liberate from noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation itself is associated with sleep disruption with contributing factors including increased work of breathing, ineffective triggering of the ventilator, and ventilatory over‑assistance. Sleep improvements have been attributed to ventilator setting optimization, including improved sleep quality with noninvasive ventilatory support at night in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and improved sleep quality, efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with pressure control ventilation targeted to achieve passive ventilation compared with low‑pressure support. Ventilatory support can also provoke hyperventilation, decreased carbon dioxide, and central apneas that lead to frequent awakenings, arousals, and sleep fragmentation. Proportional assist ventilation has been shown to decrease patient–ventilator dyssynchrony and improve sleep quality, though results are not consistent across studies, and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist has been shown to be superior to pressure support ventilation with increased REM and lessened sleep fragmentation. Overall, studies are small with inconsistent findings, and it remains to be proven that promoting sleep will positively affect respiratory outcomes; future study design concerns include selecting the phase of critical illness and integrating alternative ventilator modes with recommended parameters such as low‑Vt ventilation.

### Quantifying unintended exposure to high tidal volumes from breath stacking dyssynchrony in ARDS: the BREATHE criteria [^114b4YHV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Breath stacking dyssynchrony generates higher tidal volumes than intended, potentially increasing lung injury risk in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lack of validated criteria to quantify breath stacking dyssynchrony contributes to its under-recognition. This study evaluates performance of novel, objective criteria for quantifying breath stacking dyssynchrony (BREATHE criteria) compared to existing definitions and tests if neuromuscular blockade eliminates high-volume breath stacking dyssynchrony in ARDS.

Methods

Airway flow and pressure were recorded continuously for up to 72 h in 33 patients with ARDS receiving volume-preset assist-control ventilation. The flow-time waveform was integrated to calculate tidal volume breath-by-breath. The BREATHE criteria considered five domains in evaluating for breath stacking dyssynchrony: ventilator cycling, interval expiratory volume, cumulative inspiratory volume, expiratory time, and inspiratory time.

Results

The observed tidal volume of BREATHE stacked breaths was 11.3 (9.7–13.3) mL/kg predicted body weight, significantly higher than the preset volume [6.3 (6.0–6.8) mL/kg; p < 0.001]. BREATHE identified more high-volume breaths (≥ 2 mL/kg above intended volume) than the other existing objective criteria for breath stacking [27 (7–59) vs 19 (5–46) breaths/h; p < 0.001]. Agreement between BREATHE and visual waveform inspection was high (raw agreement 96.4–98.1%; phi 0.80–0.92). Breath stacking dyssynchrony was near-completely eliminated during neuromuscular blockade [0 (0–1) breaths/h; p < 0.001].

Conclusions

The BREATHE criteria provide an objective definition of breath stacking dyssynchrony emphasizing occult exposure to high tidal volumes. BREATHE identified high-volume breaths missed by other methods for quantifying this dyssynchrony. Neuromuscular blockade prevented breath stacking dyssynchrony, assuring provision of the intended lung-protective strategy.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^112i8FBL]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading of the diaphragm is common in mechanically ventilated patients and may contribute to ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction.

### Monitoring asynchrony during invasive mechanical ventilation [^113vAkF4]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients must effectively unload inspiratory muscles and provide safe ventilation (ie, enhancing gas exchange, protect the lungs and the diaphragm). To do that, the ventilator should be in synchrony with patient's respiratory rhythm. The complexity of such interplay leads to several concerning issues that clinicians should be able to recognize. Asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator may induce several deleterious effects that require a proper physiological understanding to recognize and manage them. Different tools have been developed and proposed beyond the careful analysis of the ventilator waveforms to help clinicians in the decision-making process. Moreover, appropriate handling of asynchrony requires clinical skills, physiological knowledge, and suitable medication management. New technologies and devices are changing our daily practice, from automated real-time recognition of asynchronies and their distribution during mechanical ventilation, to smart alarms and artificial intelligence algorithms based on physiological big data and personalized medicine. Our goal as clinicians is to provide care of patients based on the most accurate and current knowledge, and to incorporate new technological methods to facilitate and improve the care of the critically ill.

### Monitoring patient respiratory effort during mechanical ventilation: lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation [^114CeQC9]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Diaphragm Injury During Spontaneous Breathing: Myotrauma

The inappropriate use of mechanical ventilation can injure not only the lung (barotrauma and volutrauma) but also respiratory muscles (myotrauma). Mechanical ventilation causes myotrauma by various mechanisms, leading to a final common pathway of VIDD.

Mechanisms of myotrauma are summarized in Fig. 2:
Excessive unloading. Over-assistance from mechanical ventilation and suppression of respiratory drive from sedation leads to acute disuse atrophy and diaphragm weakness. Diaphragmatic unloading caused by over-assisted ventilation (both in control or assisted mode) is frequent during mechanical ventilation, in particular during the first 48 h. Of note, the low level of respiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator is not sufficient to avoid disuse atrophy, such that diaphragm atrophy can occur under pressure support ventilation.
Excessive concentric loading. The diaphragm is sensitive to excessive respiratory load. Higher inspiratory patient effort, dyssynchronies, and under-assistance due to an insufficient level of support are frequent in assisted mechanical ventilation. Vigorous concentric contractions provoke high muscular tension resulting in muscle inflammation, proteolysis, myofibrillar damage, and sarcolemma disarray. In critically ill patients, systemic inflammation renders muscle myofibrils more vulnerable to mechanical injury (.
Eccentric loading. Eccentric contractions occur when a muscle generates contractile tension while it is lengthening (rather than shortening); such contractions are much more injurious than concentric (shortening) contractions. When a low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and excessive reduction in end-expiratory lung volume are present, the diaphragm contracts even as it lengthens during the expiratory ("post-inspiratory") phase to avoid atelectasis ("expiratory braking" phenomenon). Specific forms of dyssynchrony (reverse triggering, short cycling, ineffective effort) can generate eccentric contractions because the diaphragm is activated during the expiratory phase.
Excessive PEEP. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that maintaining the diaphragm at a shorter length with the use of excessive PEEP may cause sarcomeres to "drop out" of the muscle and shorten its length (longitudinal atrophy). This could theoretically disadvantage the length-tension characteristics of the muscle once PEEP is reduced, impairing diaphragm performance.

The first three of these injury mechanisms can be detected by monitoring respiratory effort, emphasizing the potential for such monitoring to help clinicians ensure safe spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation. We now proceed to review a range of monitoring techniques to achieve this goal.

### Application progress of machine learning in patient-ventilator asynchrony during mechanical ventilation: a systematic review [^111aUwwU]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical ventilation (MV) serves as a vital life-support intervention in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), providing stable respiratory assistance to patients by maintaining oxygenation, alleviating respiratory muscle fatigue, and mitigating respiratory distress. It plays a pivotal role in the management of critically ill patients. Treatment typically commences with controlled ventilation, where respiration is entirely regulated by the ventilator. As patients regain their autonomous breathing capacity, the therapeutic approach transitions to assisted ventilation. In this case, the interaction between the patient and the ventilator constitutes a critical element of the MV process, necessitating that the ventilator responds appropriately to the patient's respiratory demands. Any discrepancy between the patient's respiratory needs and the support delivered by the ventilator during MV is termed patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA).

Among patients undergoing MV while retaining spontaneous breathing, the reported incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is as high as 10–85%. Frequent occurrences of PVA have been implicated in the development of ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI), failed weaning from mechanical ventilation, prolonged ventilation duration, and increased mortality. Currently, PVA monitoring primarily relies on real-time visual inspection of respiratory waveforms by skilled clinicians. While fundamental, this method is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and impractical for comprehensive, continuous bedside assessment across the tens of thousands of respiratory cycles patients experience daily. More advanced physiological modalities, such as electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) and esophageal pressure (Pes) measurement, offer higher accuracy in detecting specific PVA types by directly assessing patient respiratory effort. However, these techniques are invasive, require specialized equipment and expertise, and are not universally available or suitable for continuous, automated monitoring. Furthermore, ventilator-integrated rule-based methods (RBMs), though offering some automation, are limited by fixed thresholds and lack adaptability to diverse patient conditions or novel asynchrony patterns.

### Impact of reverse triggering dyssynchrony during lung-protective ventilation on diaphragm function: an experimental model [^111PZ2JC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Reverse triggering dyssynchrony (RT) is a patient-ventilator interaction where a respiratory muscle contraction is triggered by a passive mechanical insufflation. Its impact on diaphragm structure and function is unknown. Objectives: To establish an animal model of RT with lung injury receiving lung-protective ventilation and to assess its impact on the structure and function of the diaphragm. Methods: Lung injury was induced by surfactant depletion and high-stress ventilation in 32 ventilated pigs. Animals were allocated to receive passive mechanical ventilation (Vt: 10 ml/kg; respiratory rate [RR]: 30–35 breaths/min; n = 8) or a more lung-protective strategy (Vt: 6–8 ml/kg; n = 24) with adjustments in RR to facilitate the occurrence of RT for 3 hours. Diaphragm function (transdiaphragmatic pressure [Pdi] during phrenic nerve stimulation [force/frequency curve]) and structure (biopsies) were assessed. The impact of RT on diaphragm function was analyzed according to the breathing effort assessed by the pressure-time product. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with passive ventilation, the protective ventilation group with RT received significantly lower Vt (7 vs. 10 ml/kg) and higher RR (45 vs. 31 breaths/min). An entrainment pattern of 1:1 was the most frequently occurring in 83% of the animals. Breathing effort induced by RT was highly variable across animals. RT with the lowest tercile of breathing effort was associated with 23% higher twitch Pdi compared with passive ventilation, whereas RT with high breathing effort was associated with a 10% lower twitch Pdi and a higher proportion of abnormal muscle fibers. Conclusions: In a reproducible animal model of RT with variable levels of breathing effort and entrainment patterns, RT with high effort is associated with impaired diaphragm function, whereas RT with low effort is associated with preserved diaphragm force.

### Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the mode of ventilation during critical illness (MODE) trial [^115wj5Zb]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In the study ICU, respiratory therapists typically have primary responsibility for determining the initial settings for invasive mechanical ventilation and titrating the settings to achieve clinical goals (eg, arterial oxygen saturation, PCO 2, target tidal volume, target plateau pressure). To set and titrate mechanical ventilators, respiratory therapists use standard-of-care clinical protocols jointly developed by respiratory therapy and physician leaders. For patients enrolled in the MODE trial, respiratory therapists employ preexisting clinical protocols dictating how each study group (volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control) should be set and titrated (e-Appendix 1, section 5).

Ventilator Mode Modification Sheet:

If at any time, any member of the clinical team, such as a respiratory therapist, advanced practice provider, or physician, determines a specific mandatory mode of ventilation is needed for the optimal treatment of any specific patient, they may use that mode of mechanical ventilation. In these cases, a one-page mode modification sheet is completed documenting the date, time, reason for modification, and the mode of ventilation chosen. Anticipated examples of conditions for which treating clinicians may elect to override the assigned mode include refractory hypoxemia, persistently high peak pressures (> 40 cm H 2 O), dyssynchrony not amenable to changes within the assigned mode, excessive work of breathing, barotrauma, inability to limit tidal volumes delivered, or intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. If the condition that precipitated the mode modification sheet resolves, clinicians are encouraged to return to the assigned study mode and complete a new mode modification sheet if subsequent changes to the ventilator mode are required. Strategies used to monitor and improve adherence to the assigned study mode are included in e-Appendix 1 (sections 3, 4).

### Scheduled intravenous opioids [^1121aWZ2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Opioid use in the ICU raises important safety concerns. Constipation, common with opioid use, causes nausea and vomiting, increased abdominal distension and pressure, and reduced capacity for enteral feeding, in addition to esophageal motility abnormalities. Stool softeners and osmotic laxatives are often ineffective. The histamine release associated with natural opioids (e.g. morphine) can provoke bronchospasm and hypotension. Muscle rigidity is common with fentanyl; this, in turn, may compromise early exercise and mobility goals. Opioids increase delirium risk in a dose-related fashion independently from pain. As a drug class, opioids disrupt sleep, are immunosuppressive, trigger hormonal abnormalities like adrenal axis and pituitary hormone pathway suppression and hypogonadism in both sexes, alter bone metabolism and may worsen despondency through their kappa and delta receptor effects.

The controlled evidence supporting the use of analgesia-based sedation (i.e. opioid infusions to manage sedation in lieu of anxiolytic medications) is older, flawed, heterogeneous, and not applicable to current pain and sedation goals for most mechanically ventilated adults. Current evidence supports focusing on light (or even no) sedation, and the managing agitation primarily through symptom reduction and non-pharmacological approaches. IV opioids exacerbate ventilator dyssynchrony (rather than treat it). Ventilator adjustment and other strategies to reduce respiratory drive are preferred over IV opioid infusions in ICU populations at risk for asynchrony.

### An automated and standardized neural index to quantify patient-ventilator interaction [^117HTUqn]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Comparison of NeuroSync definitions to previous asynchrony definitions

The group of Thille et al. was the first to describe and quantify major asynchronies, such as wasted efforts and auto-triggering, using only airway pressure and flow waveforms, albeit without the EAdi as a reference.

The NeuroSync event defined as EAdi-without-assist corresponds to ineffective triggering with the AI Thille. An inspiratory effort not rewarded by a ventilator breath is a failure for a triggered mode and is the asynchrony predominantly associated with adverse patient outcomes. As ineffective triggering typically relates to a failure of the conventional ventilator flow and pressure sensors to detect an inspiratory effort, it is not surprising that the prevalence of ineffective triggering is greatly underestimated by airway flow and pressure detection.

The NeuroSync event defined as assist-without-EAdi resembles auto-triggering with AI Thille. If not induced by backup modes during apnea, auto-triggering is another faulty condition where the ventilator triggers and cycles off uncontrollably, and hyperventilates the patient. Auto-triggering is a very difficult asynchrony to detect with AI Thille, because there is no true patient reference to validate the ventilator triggering.

To describe dyssynchrony, the method of Thille et a l. involved detection of short and prolonged cycles (Table 1). Considering the natural variability in breathing, however, the significance of detecting these remains unclear. The closest comparison to the NeuroSync index for short cycles would be late triggering and early cycling-off values, which would fall outside the box, that is, in the upper left quadrants in Figures 1 and 3. Long cycles (Figure 1 and Table 1) are likely to be associated with early trigger (lower quadrants) and/or delayed cycling-off (right-side quadrants) or repeated EAdi during assist (asynchrony).

The AI Thille index also includes double-triggering, an event corresponding to multiple-assist-during-EAdi with the NeuroSync index. Multiple-assist-during-EAdi reflects repeated trigger and cycling-off errors during the same neural effort, which are classified as dyssynchrony. It should be noted that in assist-volume control, double triggering is a severe asynchrony associated with excessive tidal volumes. In non-flow and volume-regulated modes, double triggering would only cause a timing error with a short interruption of the inspiratory assist during an inspiratory effort.

### Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors in critically ill patients: comparison with pressure support [^11296qrL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

It is not known if proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) may be used as a mode of support in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of sustained use of PAV+ in critically ill patients and compare it with pressure support ventilation (PS).

Design and Setting

Randomized study in the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Methods

A total of 208 critically ill patients mechanically ventilated on controlled modes for at least 36 h and meeting certain criteria were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Specific written algorithms were used to adjust the ventilator settings in each mode. PAV+ or PS was continued for 48 h unless the patients met pre-defined criteria either for switching to controlled modes (failure criteria) or for breathing without ventilator assistance.

Results

Failure rate was significantly lower in PAV+ than that in PS (11.1 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.040, OR 0.443, 95% CI 0.206–0.952). The proportion of patients exhibiting major patient-ventilator dyssynchronies at least during one occasion and after adjusting the initial ventilator settings, was significantly lower in PAV+ than in PS (5.6 vs. 29.0%, P < 0.001, OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06–0.4). The proportion of patients meeting criteria for unassisted breathing did not differ between modes.

Conclusions

PAV+ may be used as a useful mode of support in critically ill patients. Compared to PS, PAV+ increases the probability of remaining on spontaneous breathing, while it considerably reduces the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchronies.

### Reverse triggering dyssynchrony 24 h after initiation of mechanical ventilation [^114NNbuc]. Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reverse triggering is a delayed asynchronous contraction of the diaphragm triggered by passive insufflation by the ventilator in sedated mechanically ventilated patients. The incidence of reverse triggering is unknown. This study aimed at determining the incidence of reverse triggering in critically ill patients under controlled ventilation.

Methods

In this ancillary study, patients were continuously monitored with a catheter measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm. A method for automatic detection of reverse triggering using electrical activity of the diaphragm was developed in a derivation sample and validated in a subsequent sample. The authors assessed the predictive value of the software. In 39 recently intubated patients under assist-control ventilation, a 1-h recording obtained 24 h after intubation was used to determine the primary outcome of the study. The authors also compared patients' demographics, sedation depth, ventilation settings, and time to transition to assisted ventilation or extubation according to the median rate of reverse triggering.

Results

The positive and negative predictive value of the software for detecting reverse triggering were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98). Using a threshold of 1 μV of electrical activity to define diaphragm activation, median reverse triggering rate was 8% (range, 0.1 to 75), with 44% (17 of 39) of patients having greater than or equal to 10% of breaths with reverse triggering. Using a threshold of 3 μV, 26% (10 of 39) of patients had greater than or equal to 10% reverse triggering. Patients with more reverse triggering were more likely to progress to an assisted mode or extubation within the following 24 h (12 of 39 [68%]) vs. 7 of 20 [35%]; P = 0.039).

Conclusions

Reverse triggering detection based on electrical activity of the diaphragm suggests that this asynchrony is highly prevalent at 24 h after intubation under assist-control ventilation. Reverse triggering seems to occur during the transition phase between deep sedation and the onset of patient triggering.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^112A7GuP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation may have adverse effects on both the lung and the diaphragm. Injury to the lung is mediated by excessive mechanical stress and strain, whereas the diaphragm develops atrophy as a consequence of low respiratory effort and injury in case of excessive effort. The lung and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation approach aims to protect both organs simultaneously whenever possible. This review summarizes practical strategies for achieving lung and diaphragm-protective targets at the bedside, focusing on inspiratory and expiratory ventilator settings, monitoring of inspiratory effort or respiratory drive, management of dyssynchrony, and sedation considerations. A number of potential future adjunctive strategies including extracorporeal CO 2 removal, partial neuromuscular blockade, and neuromuscular stimulation are also discussed. While clinical trials to confirm the benefit of these approaches are awaited, clinicians should become familiar with assessing and managing patients' respiratory effort, based on existing physiological principles. To protect the lung and the diaphragm, ventilation and sedation might be applied to avoid excessively weak or very strong respiratory efforts and patient-ventilator dysynchrony.

### Sleep cycle in children with severe acute bronchopneumonia during mechanical ventilation at different depths of sedation [^111uUJQo]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to frequent awakenings and abnormal sleep architecture, abnormal circadian rhythms are among the sleep disorder manifestations in PICU patients. EEG monitoring of children on mechanical ventilation in the PICU has revealed lower daytime than nighttime slow-wave activity and reduced nighttime sleep efficiency. In our study, night sleep duration in children on mechanical ventilation under sedation was significantly reduced. The total sleep duration normalized within 1 day after weaning from mechanical ventilation and sedative discontinuation; however, the night sleep duration accounted for only 40–50% of the total sleep duration. Circadian rhythm disturbances in children can cause decreased ventilation and dysfunction in the immune and endocrine systems. Critically ill adult patients with severe REM sleep deprivation and interrupted circadian sleep cycles are more likely to develop delirium. Abnormal sleep cycles and structures in critically ill patients prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and increase sedative-related short- and long-term psychiatric abnormalities.

Nursing care procedures are crucial for treating critically ill patients in the PICU; however, frequent nursing care procedures increase pain and stress and affect the sleep architecture. Studies have shown that adult ICU inpatients suffer from sleep interruptions while under nursing care, with increased NREM-1 stage sleep and decreased NREM-3 and REM stage sleep. In our study, the deep sedation group had more nursing care events and fewer awakenings during mechanical ventilation. In both groups, sedation depth was inversely associated with the effects of nursing care stimulation on sleep. Deep sedation in the acute phase can reduce stress response and sleep interruptions caused by stimulation. Additionally, it inhibits airway protective responses, reduces expectoration, increases airway secretions, and increases the requirement for sputum suctioning and other nursing care procedures. This explains the higher number of nursing care events in the deep sedation group than in the light sedation group. Although light sedation facilitates brain function evaluation in patients, it is more likely to cause patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and accidental extubation during mechanical ventilation. For critically ill patients requiring frequent nursing care procedures, a corresponding level of deep sedation is recommended. Although deep sedation has a greater effect on sleep architecture, it can reduce the stress response and decrease sleep interruptions caused by nursing care stimulation.

### Reverse triggering, the rhythm dyssynchrony: potential implications for lung and diaphragm protection [^112JmfLP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient–ventilator dyssynchrony occurs when mechanical support from the ventilator does not match the neuromechanical output from the patient's respiratory center. Classically, dyssynchrony subtypes have been characterized breath to breath by mismatch in the timing and/or force of patient effort relative to machine support (e.g. ineffective efforts, double triggering, delayed cycling, flow dyssynchrony, etc.). The concept of reverse triggering does not fit within this construct but rather describes one or more overarching mechanisms by which many of these breath-to-breath dyssynchronies can occur.

Reverse triggering is a patient inspiratory effort that is delayed in timing relative to the passive expansion of the lungs and chest wall by machine-initiated breaths. It often occurs in a repetitive, stereotyped pattern. Thus, reverse triggering might best be understood as a rhythm dyssynchrony, a recurring time lag between the ventilator and the patient's inspiratory effort, with the patient effort initiated slightly "off-beat" and appearing as though it was "triggered" by the ventilator.

In this issue of the Journal, Baedorf Kassis and colleagues (pp.) evaluate the effects of reverse triggering on lung mechanics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Using the Campbell diagram (pressure–volume loop of the chest wall), they detected reverse triggering in 25 of 55 patients with early ARDS, with waveform recordings with a mean of 7 minutes in duration. During reverse triggering, the maximum pressure generated by the respiratory muscles averaged between 4 and 10 cm H 2 O, which is comparable with that of healthy subjects breathing at rest, although more extreme values were observed. They further classified reverse triggering into four subtypes distinguished by the timing of reverse triggering relative to mechanical insufflation and deflation. Lung mechanical effects varied by subtype. Reverse trigger–associated effort occurring during insufflation increased Vand inspiratory transpulmonary pressures. When reverse trigger–associated effort occurred during deflation, mean expiratory transpulmonary pressure was increased.

### Assisted mechanical ventilation: the future is now! [^115SniQE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Global approaches to mechanical ventilation (MV) are usually categorized as controlled or assisted. During controlled MV the patient has no role is the process of gas delivery. As a result of pharmacological control of neural/muscular drive, each breath is programmed and delivered without active patient interaction. For this reason, controlled mechanical ventilation is generally considered a relatively simple process. Assisted ventilation, on the other hand, is a highly complex process that requires an intimate interaction between the ventilator and the patient. The complexity of this form of ventilation is frequently underappreciated by the bedside clinician. In assisted mechanical ventilation, regardless of the specific mode, the ventilator's gas delivery pattern and the patient's breathing pattern must match near perfectly or asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator occurs.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: a systematic… [^111gY2Dr]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context Left ventricular systolic dysfunction causes substantial morbidity and mortality, even with optimal pharmacotherapy. Atrial-synchronized biventricular pacemakers received US Food and Drug Administration approval for use in selected patients with LV systolic dysfunction in 2001. During a median 11-month follow-up,
6. 6% of CRT devices exhibited lead problems and 5% malfunctioned. Conclusions CRT reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with LV systolic dysfunction, prolonged QRS duration, and NYHA class 3 or 4 symptoms when combined with optimal pharmacotherapy. The incremental benefits of combined CRT plus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices vs CRT-alone devices in patients with LV systolic dysfunction remain uncertain.

Thus, there is increasing enthusiasm for the therapeutic potential of atrial-synchronized biventricular pacemakers in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. CRT is designed to eliminate the delay in activation of the LV free wall found in many patients with LV systolic dysfunction and thereby improves mechanical synchrony, which in turn increases LV filling time, reduces mitral regurgitation, and reduces septal dyskinesis. The RCTs attempted to ensure participants were treated with optimal pharmacotherapy at baseline, and all comparisons were thus of CRT plus pharmacotherapy vs pharmacotherapy alone. The mean age of trial participants was 65. 4 years; 72% were male and 5% had atrial fibrillation.

Survival over time in recipients of CRT or combined CRT-ICD devices was similar in the 95 observational studies that reported this outcome as in the 14 RCTs. CRT is an efficacious and cost-effective therapy for patients with NYHA class 3 or 4 heart failure despite optimal medical management, an LVEF of 35% or less, sinus rhythm, and ventricular dyssynchrony. CRT improves ventricular function and remodelling, symptoms, and exercise capacity, while also reducing frequency of heart failure hospitalizations by 37% and death by 22%.

### Driving pressure is not associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS [^111CzNnc]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes may damage the lung through alveolar overdistension (volutrauma and barotrauma) and by releasing inflammatory cytokines (biotrauma) into the systemic circulation. Lung-protective ventilation limits tidal volume and distending pressure on the alveolus in order to prevent mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury and improves survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In a randomized clinical trial performed by the National Institutes of Health, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NIH/NHLBI) ARDS Network, mortality in patients with ARDS was decreased with volume control ventilation using tidal volume of 6 mL/kg versus 12 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and targeting a plateau pressure (P PL) of ≤ 30 cm H 2 O versus ≤ 50 cm H 2 O. Consequently, professional societies have recommended lung-protective ventilation strategies for patients with ARDS.

Lung-protective ventilation in patients without ARDS may decrease the development of ARDS, pulmonary complications, and mortality. A meta-analysis of mechanically ventilated non-ARDS patients demonstrated that a mean tidal volume of 6.5 mL/kg versus 10.6 mL/kg PBW resulted in less development of acute lung injury or ARDS, fewer pulmonary infections, and lower mortality. Further evidence of benefit from lung-protective ventilation is supported by a systematic review and patient-level analysis that demonstrated a lower incidence of ARDS and fewer pulmonary complications in non-ARDS patients treated with a tidal volume of < 7 mL/kg PBW. However, lung-protective ventilation may not be optimal for all non-ARDS patients. In non-ARDS patients, the functional lung volume is greater, and lung-protective ventilation may cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch, alveolar hypoventilation, and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, a recent prospective randomized clinical trial found no benefit to targeting a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW versus 10 mL/kg PBW while keeping P PL below 25 cm H 2 O in non-ARDS patients.

### Is proportional-assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors a user-friendly mode? [^1167B6ox]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the number of interventions (ventilator settings and sedatives, analgesics and vasoactive medication dose manipulations) between critically ill patients on proportional-assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) and those on pressure support (PS).

Design

Retrospective analysis of data from a previous randomized clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 208 patients who were mechanically ventilated on controlled modes and met criteria for assisted breathing were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Changes in ventilator settings and in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications were identified during the period in which the patients were ventilated either with PS (30.4 ± 17.4 h) or PAV+ (30.0 ± 18.1 h) and classified as changes to facilitate weaning (CFW) or changes to respond to deterioration (CD).

Results

The mean number of changes in ventilator settings was significantly higher with PS than that with PAV+ (10.7 ± 5.7 vs. 8.9 ± 4.6). With PS the proportion of these changes classified as CFW was significantly lower than that with PAV+ (59.8% vs. 69.2%). Dyssynchrony as a cause of CD was more likely to occur with PS than with PAV+ (42 vs. 3%). The mean number of changes in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications was higher with PS than with PAV+, the difference being significant only for sedatives (4.06 ± 3.8 vs. 2.82 ± 3.4).

Conclusions

Compared to PS, PAV+ is associated with fewer intervention in terms of ventilator settings and sedative dose changes.

### Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist versus pressure support ventilation: a randomized controlled feasibility trial performed in patients at risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation [^115CPbkm]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The main reasons for crossover in the NAVA arm were Edi signal noise or interference causing loss of synchrony (8/28, 22.2%), clinical team preference for use of PSV during deterioration or instability (7/28, 19.4%), lack of trial awareness (5/28, 3.6%), and clinical inexperience leading to delayed application of NAVA (4/28, 14.3%). The three cross-overs in the PSV arm were due to perceived ventilator dyssynchrony (Table 2).

### Neuromuscular blockade is associated with the attenuation of biomarkers of epithelial and endothelial injury in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1157erXr]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Second, we demonstrated that the addition of NMB to LTVV has an effect to reduce markers of lung injury in patients who have moderate-severe ARDS. These effects of NMB on epithelial and endothelial biomarkers were not observed in patients receiving HTVV. It is possible that the deleterious effects of HTVV overwhelm any potential benefit of NMB. Alternatively, in patients with severe ARDS and likely reduced compliance, ensuring LTVV with NMB may be of critical importance. If NMB improves outcomes by reducing lung injury from ventilator dyssynchrony, respiratory demand, or atelectrauma, it is possible that the negative effects of HTVV cannot be attenuated by NMB alone.

Third, we demonstrated that the addition of NMB to LTVV reduced markers of lung injury in patients with an initial P/F ratio of less than or equal to 120. Remarkably, our results closely mirror those of Papazian et al. who saw a significant improvement in mortality in a subgroup of patients with an initial P/F ratio less than or equal to 120 and who received 48 h of neuromuscular blockade. These findings are particularly important considering a recently published epidemiological study which demonstrated that 35% of patients with ARDS receive a tidal volume greater than 8 ml/kg ideal body weight. Nearly one-third of patients with severe ARDS were treated with tidal volumes over 8 ml/kg. Moreover, 38% of severe ARDS patients, 18% of moderate ARDS patients, and 7% of mild ARDS patients are treated with NMB. Although our data compare tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg to 12 ml/kg, extrapolating our results suggests that a substantial portion of patients with ARDS who may not derive benefit but are consequently subjected to the negative side-effects of NMB, including prolonged sedation or intensive care unit-associated weakness, may be treated with NMB.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^11474qSG]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU recommendations — mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies are as follows: For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy over a lower PEEP strategy, and clinicians should monitor for barotrauma if using higher PEEP (i.e. PEEP > 10 cm H2O). For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we suggest using a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours over no prone ventilation. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest using as-needed intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) over continuous NMBA infusion to facilitate protective lung ventilation, and in the event of persistent ventilator dyssynchrony or the need for ongoing deep sedation, prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures, we suggest using a continuous NMBA infusion for up to 48 hours. In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 ARDS, we recommend against the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide, whereas in those with severe ARDS and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation and other rescue strategies, we suggest a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator as a rescue therapy and, if no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed, the treatment should be tapered off. For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, we suggest using recruitment maneuvers over not using recruitment maneuvers, but if recruitment maneuvers are used, we recommend against using staircase (incremental PEEP) recruitment maneuvers. In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, use of rescue therapies, and proning, we suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), if available, or referring the patient to an ECMO center, noting the remark that because of the resource-intensive nature of ECMO and the need for experienced centers, healthcare professionals, and infrastructure, ECMO should be considered only for carefully selected patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^112hsunK]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate associations between patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and clinical outcome measures.

Data Sources

For this systematic review, the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Emcare were screened until June 20, 2024.

Study Selection

The main inclusion criterion was the assessment of the association of PVA with clinical outcome measures (length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality).

Data Extraction

All forms of PVA subtypes reported in the articles were systematically collected. Furthermore, the method used to identify asynchrony and the clinical outcomes described were recorded from each study.

Data Synthesis

A total of 19 studies were included with a total of 2672 patients. The results of the meta-analysis show that overall PVA and ineffective triggering and double triggering are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 3.29 d; 95% CI, 0.13–6.44 d), and with a longer ICU length of stay (mean difference, 3.65 d; 95% CI, 1.20–6.11 d). No association was found between PVA and mortality. In addition, reverse triggering appears to have a potential positive association with outcome.

Conclusions

PVA and specifically ineffective triggering and double triggering, are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer ICU length of stay.

### An epidemic of dyssynchrony: but what does it mean? [^111VjoXw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used to treat a subset of heart failure patients with discoordinate wall motion. Defining appropriate patients is important, and, although electrical delay (wide QRS) is commonly used, recent data show that measures of mechanical dyssynchrony improve the sensitivity and specificity of predicting responders (including patients with narrow QRS complexes). This has stimulated studies of dyssynchrony per se, and the phenomenon now appears to be very common in virtually all forms of heart failure. However, what all this dyssynchrony means clinically, and how or whether it should be treated by CRT or other means, remains unclear.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^117WT7uR]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical ventilation may cause diaphragm dysfunction by a variety of postulated mechanisms, including overassistance myotrauma, underassistance myotrauma, and eccentric myotrauma. Eccentric myotrauma is thought to occur when the diaphragm contracts while lengthening, resulting in high shear stresses that induce acute injury and weakness. In mechanically ventilated patients, eccentric contractions can occur when the ventilator cycles into the expiratory phase before the neural inspiratory phase is complete, resulting in "post-inspiratory" loading of the muscle. Such post-inspiratory loading occurs during multiple forms of patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and under conditions of expiratory braking, where prolonged diaphragm contractions slow the rate of decrease in lung volume during the early course of expiration to prevent atelectasis. Recent data suggest that post-inspiratory loading may be common in critically ill patients.

The hypothesis of eccentric myotrauma as a mechanism of ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction is intriguing, but its clinical relevance remains uncertain. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions are associated with acute diaphragm injury and dysfunction and that eccentric loading results in acute diaphragmatic weakness. Diaphragm biopsies in humans including mechanically ventilated patients manifest evidence of acute load-induced injury and inflammation, suggesting that load-induced injury occurs in this setting. It remains unclear however whether dyssynchrony and associated post-inspiratory loading — apart from elevated inspiratory load per se — contribute to the development of diaphragm weakness in the clinical setting. Clinical evidence for eccentric myotrauma would imply that achieving synchrony is critical to diaphragm-protective ventilation.

To characterize in detail the evolution of diaphragm activity over time and to evaluate the influence of inspiratory loading and dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading on diaphragm function during mechanical ventilation, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study with hourly recordings of diaphragm activity and daily measurements of diaphragm neuromuscular coupling for up to 7 days in mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of requiring prolonged ventilation.

### Expiratory muscle relaxation-induced ventilator triggering: a novel patient-ventilator dyssynchrony [^1129a9k9]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation, expiratory muscles are recruited with high respiratory loading and/or low inspiratory muscle capacity, or with pulmonary hyperinflation. Critical illness is associated with time-dependent changes in expiratory muscle mass, and coordination of activation between inspiratory muscles and expiratory muscles in ventilated patients may be disturbed. Herein, we present a previously unrecognized patient-ventilator dyssynchrony characterized by ventilator triggering by expiratory muscle relaxation.

### Patient-ventilator asynchronies: may the respiratory mechanics play a role? [^114WRsCC]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In stable patients ready to be discharged with a home non-invasive ventilatory program there is a high incidence of asynchrony.

- Thirty percent of patients showed severe asynchrony, most of which were represented by ineffective efforts (detected in 20% of patients).

- The occurrence of asynchrony is not correlated to any variable of respiratory mechanics and does not differ between patients with obstructive or restrictive disease.

- A high incidence of asynchrony is associated with a poorer tolerance of NIV.

### Effects of sedatives and opioids on trigger and cycling asynchronies throughout mechanical ventilation: an observational study in a large dataset from critically ill patients [^116kqe1e]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to present data relating asynchronies and treatment with sedatives and opioids throughout the complete MV period. The overall rate of asynchronies did not differ between days classified as opioids-only, sedatives-only, and sedatives-plus-opioids. Patients receiving sedatives had a lower level of consciousness than those receiving opioids-only; sedatives-plus-opioids decreased the level of consciousness, but did not result in fewer asynchronies than the other treatments. Interestingly, in sedatives-plus-opioids days, the sedative dose was directly associated with the rate of asynchronies and with a lower level of consciousness, whereas higher opioid doses were associated with a lower AI without worsening level of consciousness. Thus, opioid administration seems a clinically sound approach to improve patient-ventilator synchrony while preserving consciousness.

Patients with shock or severe respiratory failure often require sedatives. Moreover, sedatives are sometimes administered in attempts to improve patient-ventilator interaction. However, deep sedation has been associated with worse outcomes. Lighter or no-sedation is favored in partial ventilatory support modes, where patient-ventilator synchrony is crucial. Physiological studies show that sedatives have varying effects on asynchronies. Increasing sedatives/analgesia is relatively ineffective in abolishing severe breath-stacking. Deep sedation with propofol increases asynchronies during pressure support ventilation, whereas light sedation does not; deeper sedation is associated with increased ineffective triggering events and with increased mortality. Thus, sedative management in MV is a modifiable variable that could improve outcomes.

Associations between sedatives and asynchronies are probably confounded by many factors, especially by clinicians' ventilator adjustments. In our study, the incidence of asynchronies was associated with the drugs used (sedatives and opioids), irrespective of the ventilatory mode. However, sedatives lowered patients' level of consciousness without decreasing asynchronies beyond opioids alone. Inadequate pain control worsens patient-ventilator synchrony and is associated with agitation, which negatively affects outcomes. Richman et al. found that patients receiving midazolam-plus-opioids had fewer asynchronies/day over a 3-day period than those receiving midazolam alone. Our results support these findings, showing that opioids could help improve asynchronies beyond sedatives, although prospective trials are necessary to determine whether appropriate opioids favor better synchrony by ensuring adequate analgesia without depressing consciousness and without affecting respiratory drive or minute ventilation.

### Patient-ventilator interactions. implications for clinical management [^111qCBMU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Assisted/supported modes of mechanical ventilation offer significant advantages over controlled modes in terms of ventilator muscle function/recovery and patient comfort (and sedation needs). However, assisted/supported breaths must interact with patient demands during all three phases of breath delivery: trigger, target, and cycle. Synchronous interactions match ventilator support with patient demands; dyssynchronous interactions do not. Dyssynchrony imposes high pressure loads on ventilator muscles, promoting muscle overload/fatigue and increasing sedation needs. On current modes of ventilation there are a number of features that can monitor and enhance synchrony. These include adjustments of the trigger variable, the use of pressure versus fixed flow targeted breaths, and a number of manipulations of the cycle variable. Clinicians need to know how to use these modalities and monitor them properly, especially understanding airway pressure and flow graphics. Future strategies are emerging that have theoretical appeal but they await good clinical outcome studies before they become commonplace.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HdGqf]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and life-threatening condition that complicates a variety of critical illnesses, including sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma. Characterized by intense lung inflammation, consolidation, and progressive microatelectasis, ARDS is associated clinically with severe hypoxemia, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and high susceptibility to barotrauma and ventilator-induced lung injury. Approximately 140,000 patients are affected by ARDS annually in the United States alone. Despite advances in the relevant technology and research methods, mortality from ARDS remains as high as 26% to 58%.

Although relatively few interventions may improve survival for patients with ARDS, the interventions with most supportive research findings are ventilation strategies that aim to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. In a landmark clinical trial, low-tidal-volume ventilation was found to improve survival for critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS, and a systematic review of 10 related randomized trials supports this finding. Whereas a lung-protective role for high levels of PEEP in adult ARDS is less clear, a patient-level meta-analysis including 2,299 participants from three trials suggests lower mortality, particularly for moderate to severe ARDS. Prone ventilation may also have a lung-protective effect. Similarly, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may have an important role in the management of critically ill adults with ARDS.

Clinicians commonly rely on NMBAs in the management of ARDS to prevent patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, to minimize the work of breathing, and to improve oxygenation. Indeed, an early, small, randomized trial demonstrated improved oxygenation with continuous cisatracurium therapy. In a subsequent trial, the same group of investigators found a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory biomarkers in both the blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of patients treated with cisatracurium, along with improved oxygenation. Recently, they reported a trial of 339 patients that did not show a statistically significant reduction in crude hospital mortality. These potential benefits must be weighed against prevailing concerns about NMBA therapy, including progressive atelectasis due to loss of diaphragmatic tone (with resultant hypoxemia) and, most important, ICU-acquired weakness. Those concerns previously led one guideline panel to suggest NMBAs as a consideration only in the setting of severe hypoxemia, and another to recommend avoiding NMBAs.

### How often does patient-ventilator asynchrony occur and what are the consequences? [^116DvCXY]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation can be life-saving for patients with acute respiratory failure. In between the 2 extremes of complete and no ventilatory support, both patient and machine contribute to ventilatory work. Ideally, ventilator gas delivery would perfectly match patient demand. This patient-ventilator interaction depends on how the ventilator responds to patient respiratory effort and, in turn, how the patient responds to the breath delivered by the ventilator. It is now evident that the interaction between patient and ventilator is frequently suboptimal and that patient-ventilator asynchrony is common. Its prevalence depends on numerous factors, including timing and duration of observation, technique used for detection, patient population, type of asynchrony, ventilation mode and settings (eg, trigger, flow, and cycle criteria), and confounding factors (eg, state of wakefulness, sedation). Patient-ventilator asynchrony is associated with adverse effects, including higher/wasted work of breathing, patient discomfort, increased need for sedation, confusion during the weaning process, prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer stay, and possibly higher mortality. Whether asynchrony is a marker of poor prognosis or causes these adverse outcomes remains to be determined.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^111AygvJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, our review aims to address these gaps by examining the effects of each type of asynchrony separately. Also, the most recent articles will be included to provide an updated and comprehensive analysis. To achieve this, systematic review with meta-analysis is conducted to investigate if there is an association between PVA and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. This approach will help to clarify the specific impacts of different types of asynchrony on clinical outcomes, potentially offering more precise guidance for clinical practice.

### Mechanical dyssynchrony in advanced decompensated heart failure: relation to hemodynamic responses to intensive medical therapy [^113Vnjxe]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with heart failure, the degree of intraventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (intra-VMD) at baseline may predict reversal of cardiac remodeling with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of intra-VMD in patients admitted for advanced decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 50 patients with ADHF without previous CRT implantation who had been admitted to a specialized heart failure intensive care unit because of hemodynamic derangements. All patients underwent comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 12 hours of admission and after 48 hours from baseline evaluation after intensive medical therapy. Intra-VMD was assessed by the opposing wall time-to-peak myocardial velocity intervals in a four-segment model using color-tissue Doppler imaging.

Results

In our study cohort (mean age 57 ± 11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 26 ± 10%, QRS width 127 ± 31 ms, cardiac index 2.0 ± 0.6 L/min/m(2)), significant intra-VMD (≥ 65 ms) was present in 44% of subjects at baseline, and 56% of patients presented with QRS > 120 ms. There was no correlation between QRS width and extent of intra-VMD. Intensive medical therapy was associated with a significant reduction in intra-VMD (85 ± 23 ms vs. 39 ± 19 ms; P < .001). Significant hemodynamic improvement in cardiac index, filling pressures, and systemic and pulmonic vascular resistance was seen only in patients with intra-VMD.

Conclusion

A substantial subset of patients admitted with ADHF and hemodynamic derangements demonstrate evidence of intra-VMD, which is reduced at follow-up and independent of underlying QRS width. Nevertheless, the presence of significant intra-VMD is associated with a more reversible hemodynamic profile.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^111imS4m]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Is there an association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcome measures?

Findings: This systematic review investigates the association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcome measures. Patient-ventilator asynchrony is significant associated with a prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.

Meaning: The occurrence of patient-ventilator asynchrony can have a negative effect on outcome and should possibly be avoided.

In the ICU, complex care is provided to critically ill patients. Many of these patients are mechanically ventilated. When there is a lack of synchronization between the ventilator assistance and the patient's breathing patterns, we speak of patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA). PVA is a common problem encountered in the management of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV). There are different types of PVAs occurring during the respiratory cycles. Currently, there is no widely accepted gold standard for detecting PVA. The most commonly used method for PVA detection is according to visualization of flow, pressure, and volume waveforms, but this approach has limited accuracy. Therefore, additional signals such as esophageal pressure and electrical activity of the diaphragm can be used to provide more detailed information and improve detection.

Asynchrony can lead to a higher work of breathing, which leads to excessive strain on the respiratory muscles. This, in turn, can lead to more dyspnea and discomfort.

Several studies have been published describing the effect of PVA on clinical outcomes, but the results are inconsistent. One review by Kyo et al examined the effect of asynchrony in general and ineffective triggering in particular on the duration of MV, ICU and hospital mortality, reintubation, and tracheostomy placements. Their results indicated that patients with more than 10% asynchrony are at risk of prolonged MV and increased ICU and hospital mortality. However, the certainty of evidence for these results is low, and the study dates from 2021.

Furthermore, there are studies, such as those by Blanch et al and Ge et al, that show inconsistent results, particularly regarding mortality. Additionally, Kyo et al did not examine different types of asynchronies separately, which recent literature suggest is significant.

### Mechanical ventilation: past lessons and the near future [^111Shntn]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Recent progress and future prospects

Emerging technologies

Important challenges remain in current practice (Table 2). Although we have learned important lessons much too slowly regarding the dangers of protracted endotracheal intubation, ventilator-induced lung injury, sedation issues, and breathing dys-synchrony, our cumulative experience has given rise to advances with potential for better care of the ventilated patient. Greatly improved noninvasive ventilation may obviate the need for more invasive approaches in many patients. For the foreseeable future, however, intubation will continue to be required to protect the airway, to extract retained secretions, to allow deep sedation, and to control ventilation for purposes of manipulating the airway or performing cardiothoracic surgery.

Table 2
Continuing challenges relative to ventilator management

Secretion retention will therefore probably remain a vexing source of complications so long as invasive intubation is required. The unperfused biofilm that lines the tube is inaccessible to host defenses, providing a safe haven for large infective inoculums to form and later seed the lung. Nonetheless, approaches that minimize or remove the infective endotracheal biofilm, visualize the proximal airways, reduce secretion impaction, and assist with sputum elimination by attention to inspiratory flow modification, percussive vibration of the air column, and mechanically aided coughing promise to minimize secretion-related complications.

Genuine progress has also been made in the attempt to link appropriate patient demands for ventilatory assistance with synchronous triggering and power. Initial benefits from pressure support and pressure control have paved the way for recently released innovations such as proportional assist ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist. With better monitoring of mechanics and gas exchange, automated goal-directed algorithms integrated into the machine circuitry may enable automated upregulation and downregulation of power assistance, fraction of inspired oxygen, and PEEP, according to demands and patient response. These algorithms have only recently gained traction in the clinical setting but clearly are steps in the right direction.

Concerns regarding ventilator-induced lung injury continue, of course, but deployment of the laboratory-proven and venerated esophageal balloon monitoring of pleural pressure may now enable routine determination of transpulmonary pressure - a value that comes a step closer to the calculation of effective stress upon the lung itself during spontaneous breathing and that helps select the PEEP that must be applied to keep it positive so as to avoid collapse (Figure 7). Direct measurement of functional residual capacity allows estimation of the size of the baby lung, which does not always coincide with estimates based on transpulmonary pressure.

### Respiratory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an expert opinion [^111kaZEU]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In moderate/severe ARDS, neuromuscular blocking agents may be useful in the acute phase

Rationale and literature findings

Deep sedation alone cannot totally exclude generation of a high transpulmonary pressure and, paradoxically, can also favor certain forms of asynchrony, such as reverse triggering. Neuromuscular blocking agents may be required to avoid possible dyssynchrony and the generation of excessive transpulmonary pressure by the inspiratory muscles in moderate to severe ARDS. Although the benefit of this strategy may relate in part to decreased VILI as a result of lower transpulmonary pressures and reduced dyssynchrony and breath stacking, this speculation remains unproven. By maintaining expiratory transpulmonary pressure, neuromuscular blocking agents can prevent expiratory efforts causing derecruitment. Cisatracurium can also have anti-inflammatory properties by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, use of neuromuscular blocking agents should be reserved for patients with the most severe ARDS, mainly in the acute phase and during the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Neuromuscular blockade requires sustained deep sedation. Adverse effects of prolonged use of these drugs include myopathy, deleterious effects on the diaphragm and ICU-acquired weakness, especially in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids.

Sedation should be reduced and partial ventilator support can be used to promote respiratory muscle activity whenever gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic status have improved

Rationale and literature findings

Sedation should be titrated according to local protocols, including regular drug interruption. As soon as a patient's oxygenation improves so that the FiO 2 and PEEP can be reduced, efforts should be taken to stop or reduce sedation and assess for weaning readiness. If the patient's ventilatory drive causes high tidal volumes, an excessive respiratory rate, a profound decrease in inspiratory intrathoracic pressure or breathing discoordination, then it may be necessary to resume sedation.

Partial ventilatory support requires less sedation than fully controlled mechanical ventilation, can reduce ventilation − perfusion mismatch and can decrease the duration of ventilator support and ICU stay. However, patient − ventilator synchrony is of paramount importance, and even assisted ventilation can induce VILI because of the generation of high tidal volumes and transpulmonary pressures, which if unrecognized can negatively impact patient outcome.

### Asynchrony and dyspnea [^117XTMmB]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Patient-ventilator synchrony and patient comfort are assumed to go hand in hand, yet few studies provide support for this common sense idea. In reality, synchrony between the patient and ventilator is complex and can be affected by the ventilator settings, type of ventilator, patient-ventilator interface, and sedation. Inspections of airway pressure and flow waveforms are reliable methods for detecting asynchrony, and automated detection seems accurate. A number of types of asynchronies have been defined, and asynchrony during invasive and noninvasive ventilation have different calling cards. There is a clear association between asynchrony, ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Whether these are cause and effect or simply associated remains to be determined.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^1164Z15G]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines were followed and can be found in Appendix A.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were included if the effect of the occurrence of PVA on at least one clinical outcome measure was described in mechanically ventilated patients.

Studies were excluded if they involved noninvasive ventilation, and studies performed on neonatal, pediatric, and brain-injured patients were excluded. The search was limited to English articles. In addition, reviews, editorials, and case-studies were excluded.

Outcomes of Interest

The outcome measures were mortality both in the hospital and the ICU, duration of MV, and ICU length of stay. Weaning failure was considered as an extra outcome measure.

Definitions

The different types of PVA were defined as follows.

Ineffective triggering is defined as failure to recognize a patient's breathing attempt by the ventilator. Double triggering means that the ventilator delivers two breaths in response to one effort inspiration of the patient. This occurs when the duration of initial support provided by the ventilator is insufficient, leading to the occurrence of two triggers. Short cycling or early cycling occurs when the ventilator ends flow delivery, but the patient's inspiratory effort continues. Prolonged cycling or delayed cycling is defined as mechanical insufflation that continues after inspiration has ceased or even during expiration. With auto-triggering, the ventilator triggers an unscheduled breath that was not initiated by the patient. In reverse triggering, a first breath is initiated by the ventilator and the second by the patient. This usually occurs in patients on controlled ventilation and in sedated patients. The occurrence of reverse triggering can lead to breath stacking. Flow starvation is defined as inadequate gas delivery, this occurs when the ventilator flow is too low for the patient's needs. This can lead to excessive muscle strain, this is most often seen in volume assist-controlled ventilation due to the fact that flow is controlled.

The asynchrony index (AI) is a common metric used in many studies to quantify the degree of asynchrony. A threshold of 10% has been commonly adopted to define significant asynchrony, based on its association with clinical outcomes.

Burden of exposure to patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and post-inspiratory diaphragm contractile loading over time

Fig. 3
Post-inspiratory loading during reverse triggering and premature cycling. A Post-inspiratory loading during reverse triggering. Persistent mechanical effort during the "post-inspiratory" period is evident from the flow tracings, which reveal an attenuated expiratory flow signal indicative of continued diaphragmatic contractile effort. The Pmus waveform is estimated from the Edi waveform and measurement of respiratory neuromuscular coupling (see text for details). The area subtended by the Pmus waveform during the post-inspiratory period (ventilator has cycled off, patient persists with inspiratory effort) is taken as the post-inspiratory effort. In this case, the post-inspiratory loading is attributable to reverse triggering of the patient by the ventilator. B In these tracings, the ventilator cycles off at approximately the peak of diaphragm electrical activity, more than 200 ms prior to the end of neural inspiration in most breaths (red vertical lines). Evidence of persistent mechanical effort during this "post-inspiratory" period is evident from the flow tracings, which reveal an attenuated expiratory flow signal indicative of continued diaphragmatic contractile effort. In this case, the post-inspiratory loading is attributable to premature cycling of the ventilator

Post-inspiratory diaphragm contractile loading was more likely to occur in hourly recordings where dyssynchronies were observed including reverse triggering (OR 15 for presence of post-inspiratory loading during controlled ventilation, 95% CI 8–35), premature cycling (OR 7.9, 95% CI 6.3–10.0), breath stacking without reverse triggering (OR 4.9, 95% CI 3.1–7.8), and ineffective triggering (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.2–3.8) (Additional file 1: Figure E6). Pressure support mode was associated with higher Edi, higher estimated Pmus, and greater post-inspiratory loading compared to volume control and pressure control (Additional file 1: Figure E7). Post-inspiratory loading was minimal during CPAP mode (Additional file 1: Figure E7). Post-inspiratory loading was correlated with inspiratory effort (Additional file 1: Figure E8).

### The ventilator of the future: key principles and unmet needs [^111oRFFC]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the missing pieces?

Given the primary objectives of respiratory assistance outlined earlier in this discussion, it seems clear that even the most sophisticated current ventilators do not provide optimized support to the patient with life-threatening respiratory failure. Specifically, positive pressure ventilation simultaneously impacts other vital organ systems with potential for adverse consequences. As a rule, PEEP and mean airway pressures should be minimized to their lowest effective values consistent with the key objectives of the clinician. Doing so lowers ventilatory demand and reduces mechanical stress, strain and power while helping to avoid the needs for unneeded compensatory fluids and vasoactive drugs (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Desired characteristics of the ventilator of the future. Integrated monitoring and awareness of influential variables would ideally allow the machine to optimize and regulate the ventilatory prescription to comply with the goals of care on an ongoing basis. Trend analysis and timely communication with the caregiver track progress and forewarn of problems before they worsen

Monotony of V T and cycling intervals, which encourages atelectasis and seldom occurs during health, would ideally be avoided by more natural breathing patterns and sighs, especially when very low tidal volumes are targeted. Moreover, alterations of body position that affect global and regional transpulmonary pressures should be taken into account. An ideal machine of the future would monitor functional residual capacity, transpulmonary pressures, cardiovascular variables, and the energetics that drive ventilation and gas exchange, as well as track carbon dioxide (CO 2) production and dead space fraction through analysis of exhaled gas. To confront physiologic complexity and variations of caregiver availability and interpretive expertise, automated, goal-guided corrective adjustments would narrow the gaps between targeted and observed values in a 'semi-closed' form of closed loop ventilation, alerting the caregiver when intervention is clearly needed necessary to avert deterioration.

### Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions impair diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients [^113ZRJV4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading of the diaphragm was common during mechanical ventilation and was associated with a progressive impairment in diaphragm function. By contrast, elevated inspiratory loading of the diaphragm was not associated with adverse changes in diaphragm function over time. These observations support the hypothesis that eccentric myotrauma may be an important mechanism of ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction in the clinical setting.

Diaphragm disuse leads to rapid muscle atrophy during mechanical ventilation. We found that diaphragm contractility was very low or absent in a majority patients over the first 48–72 h of mechanical ventilation, similar to previous observations by Sklar et al. highlighting the need for timely intervention to maintain diaphragm activity and prevent diaphragm atrophy. Both decreases and increases in diaphragm thickness on ultrasound were associated with impaired diaphragm neuromuscular coupling, suggesting that as previously hypothesized these rapid changes in the diaphragm are indicative of deleterious structural changes in the muscle, possibly including disuse atrophy, inflammation, edema, or replacement fibrosis.

In the context of acute systemic illness, the diaphragm may be exquisitely sensitive to injury from excessive loading. We found that elevated inspiratory loading and post-inspiratory loading were common during mechanical ventilation and that various dyssynchronies (especially reverse triggering and premature cycling) increased the probability of post-inspiratory loading. The observation that dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading — and not (synchronous) inspiratory loading — was associated with impaired diaphragm function suggests that attention to synchrony between patient and ventilator, rather than limiting respiratory effort, should be a priority in order to protect the diaphragm from load-induced injury. Post-inspiratory loading might be attenuated during assisted ventilation by the use of proportional assistance modes (which have better cycling synchrony) or by optimizing the cycling threshold in pressure support. It is possible that post-inspiratory loading may, in some contexts, be of theoretical benefit, as during expiratory braking where the diaphragm acts to maintain lung volume and limit atelectasis during the expiratory phase.

### Neuromuscular blockade resistance during therapeutic hypothermia [^117Ja9An]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of neuromuscular blockade resistance to multiple agents during therapeutic hypothermia and discuss possible mechanisms of this resistance.

Case Summary

A 64-year-old man with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer and respiratory distress developed cardiac arrest in the emergency department. The man was quickly resuscitated and treated with therapeutic hypothermia. A chest tube was inserted for pleural drainage of a large right-sided effusion that collapsed the right lung; this was unsuccessful in reinflating the lung. A bronchopleural fistula developed and independent lung ventilation was initiated due to persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade was initiated after sedation and analgesia did not control shivering and was continued due to patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and persistent hypoxemia. Despite large doses of 3 different neuromuscular blocking agents and negligible response to train-of-four tests, clinical neuromuscular blockade, represented by ventilator synchrony, was not achieved until the patient was warmed.

Discussion

Resistance to neuromuscular blocking agents has been reported in critically ill patients. Our case of neuromuscular blockade resistance occurred in a patient treated with therapeutic hypothermia, which generally requires a dose reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents. Resistance to neuromuscular blockade was quickly reversed upon warming of the patient as patient-ventilator synchrony was achieved at lower neuromuscular blocking agent doses.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of a potential blunted response to neuromuscular blocking agents during therapeutic hypothermia and difficulty with paralysis monitoring since train-of-four response may correlate poorly with clinical neuromuscular blockade during hypothermia. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of this interaction, identify patients at risk, and evaluate alternative strategies to neuromuscular blockade for controlling shivering in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.

### Patient-ventilator interaction [^116VUBrx]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Patient-ventilator interaction has been the focus of increasing attention from both manufacturers and researchers during the last 25 years. There is now compelling evidence that passive (controlled) mechanical ventilation leads to respiratory muscle dysfunction and atrophy, prolonging the need for ventilatory support and predisposing to a number of adverse patient outcomes. Although there is consensus that the respiratory muscles should retain some activity during acute respiratory failure, patient-ventilator asynchrony is now recognized as a cause of ineffective ventilation, impaired gas exchange, lung overdistention, increased work of breathing, and patient discomfort. Far more common than previously recognized, it also predisposes to respiratory muscle dysfunction and other complications, leads to excessive use of sedation, increases the duration of ventilatory support, and interferes with weaning. Appropriate recognition and management of patient-ventilator asynchrony require bedside assessment of ventilator graphics as well as direct patient observation. Among currently available ventilation modes and approaches, none has been shown to be clearly superior to all the others with respect to patient-ventilator interaction, and strongly held preferences among investigators have led to controversy and difficulties in carrying out appropriate studies evaluating them. As a result, marked practice variation exists among different specialties as well as in different institutions and geographical areas. The respected authorities on mechanical ventilation who participated in this conference differed in the modes they preferred but agreed that proper understanding and use according to the individual patient's needs are more important than which mode is chosen. Conference participants discussed the determinants, manifestations, and epidemiology of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and described and compared several ventilation modes aimed specifically at preventing and ameliorating it. The papers arising from these discussions represent the most thorough examination of this important aspect of respiratory care yet published.

### Neuromuscular blockade is associated with the attenuation of biomarkers of epithelial and endothelial injury in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113m5sCH]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a secondary analysis of the ARMA study to determine the association between days of NMB and biomarkers of epithelial and endothelial lung injury and systemic inflammation stratified by initial P/F ratio and tidal volume size. After adjusting for multiple cofounders, patients with an initial P/F ratio of less than or equal to 120 and receiving LTVV had decreasing concentrations of SP-D, VWF, and IL-8 with each day of NMB. These findings correlate with a recent clinical trial of NMB, where all patients received LTVV; the greatest benefit was observed in patients with an initial P/F ratio of less than or equal to 120.

These findings are significant for three reasons. First, these findings suggest that the improvement in patient outcomes with NMB in moderate-to-severe ARDS are in part secondary to a reduction in epithelial and endothelial injury and not only to a direct anti-inflammatory effect of NMB. Previous clinical trials had demonstrated that 48 h of cisatracurium in patients with moderate-severe ARDS and treated with LTVV had promising improvements in 90-day mortality and that cisatracurium was associated with decreased markers of inflammation in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. At least four mechanisms were proposed to explain this improvement in mortality and decreased markers of inflammation, including a reduction in: 1) ventilator dyssynchrony; 2) respiratory demand; 3) atelectrauma; and 4) inflammation from direct anti-inflammatory effects of cisatracurium. Mechanical power is a measure that may integrate many of these mechanisms and predict VILI. Previous investigations by both Beitler et al. and Pohlman et al. demonstrated that one type of ventilatory dyssynchrony, double triggering, was associated with the delivery of large tidal volumes. NMB may eliminate such dyssynchrony and thus reduce VILI. Moreover, Doorduin et al. recently demonstrated that partial NMB can reduce spontaneous patient effort, thus decreasing alveolar distention but maintaining diaphragmatic activity in support modes of ventilation. Our data build on these findings, suggesting that NMB may have direct effects on the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium possibly due to a reduction in ventilator dyssynchrony, respiratory demand, and atelectrauma and not through anti-inflammatory effects alone.

### 2019 year in review: patient-ventilator synchrony [^112rtrBa]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient-ventilator synchrony is a popular topic of research on mechanical ventilation. This review puts this research into both contemporary and historical perspective. Five areas of research are described: literature reviews, manual detection of synchrony problems, automated detection of synchrony problems, modes for improving synchrony, and effects of sedation. We note that this type of research lacks a standardized vocabulary and associated taxonomy, which generates difficulty in communication among students and researchers, as well as in comparison of results. Hence, we conclude this paper with some suggestions for improvement in that regard.

### Automated detection and quantification of reverse triggering effort under mechanical ventilation [^116vXiya]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our main goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the automatic detection on different types of tracings in terms of modes and patient's effort, and we assessed a large number of breaths but in a relatively limited number of patients. Our tracing selection included RT rates ranging from 0 to 93.3% representing a broad spectrum of clinical situations. We evaluated pressure control, volume control and pressure support ventilation, which are the most frequently used modes worldwide. We cannot extrapolate the algorithm performances to other modes. We arbitrarily limited our definition of RT to patients' efforts that reached maximum intensity within 1.5 s after the start of mandatory breath to differentiate RT from ineffective effort during expiration. Some patients have a fluctuating respiratory drive and intermittently trigger the ventilator. Reverse-triggered breaths usually keep the same characteristics of phase lag. We used a simple operational definition for RT not taking into account entrainment pattern. Entrainment patterns might result from different underlying causes and mechanisms. Validation of an automatic detection of this dyssynchrony is the first step to better describe RT and grasp the full spectrum of its physiologic mechanism, consequences and prevention.

### Strategies for lung-and diaphragm-protective ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a physiological trial [^11573KwR]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In a sensitivity analysis specifying more liberal LDP targets (∆Pes −3 to −12 cm H 2 O, ∆P L, dyn ≤ 20 cm H 2 O), 22/30 patients met LDP targets after LDP titration at both PEEP levels (73%, 95% CI 56, 86%), including 9/14 patients not receiving VV-ECMO (64%, 95% CI 46, 79%) and 13/16 patients receiving VV-ECMO (81%, 95% CI 64, 91%).

The LDP titration procedure was generally well tolerated. The most commonly observed adverse event associated with the intervention at any time point was respiratory acidosis in 5 (16%) patients. The protocol could not be completed in 1 patient due to a significant increase in the work of breathing following application of lower PEEP (∆Pes < –25 cm H 2 O and signs of respiratory distress). Two (6%) patients developed transient hypotension requiring an increased vasopressor dose due to increases in sedation. No severe patient-ventilator dyssynchrony was observed.

Phase 2 — Optimizing spontaneous breathing: specific effect of PEEP titration

Median (IQR) PEEP at the higher PEEP step was 14 cm H 2 O (13, 16 cm H 2 O); at the lower PEEP step it was 8 cm H 2 O (8, 8 cm H 2 O). Higher PEEP had, on average, minimal effect on ∆Pes (mean difference –1 cm H 2 O, 95% CrI –3, 1 cm H 2 O) or ∆P L, dyn (mean difference −1 cm H 2 O, 95% CrI −3, 2 cm H 2 O) (Fig. 3 A). The probability of meeting LDP targets was similar at higher and lower PEEP levels (47% vs. 40%, median OR 1.5, 95% CrI 0.5, 5) (Fig. 3 B).

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^116oYNWF]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

To evaluate associations between patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and clinical outcome measures.

DATA SOURCES:

For this systematic review, the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Emcare were screened until June 20, 2024.

STUDY SELECTION:

The main inclusion criterion was the assessment of the association of PVA with clinical outcome measures (length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality).

DATA EXTRACTION:

All forms of PVA subtypes reported in the articles were systematically collected. Furthermore, the method used to identify asynchrony and the clinical outcomes described were recorded from each study.

DATA SYNTHESIS:

A total of 19 studies were included with a total of 2672 patients. The results of the meta-analysis show that overall PVA and ineffective triggering and double triggering are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 3.29 d; 95% CI, 0.13–6.44 d), and with a longer ICU length of stay (mean difference, 3.65 d; 95% CI, 1.20–6.11 d). No association was found between PVA and mortality. In addition, reverse triggering appears to have a potential positive association with outcome.

CONCLUSIONS:

PVA and specifically ineffective triggering and double triggering, are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer ICU length of stay.

### Patient-ventilator asynchronies: clinical implications and practical solutions [^115ZjScr]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a supportive treatment commonly applied in critically ill patients. Whenever the patient is spontaneously breathing, the pressure applied to the respiratory system depends on the sum of the pressure generated by the respiratory muscles and the pressure generated by the ventilator. Patient-ventilator interaction is of utmost importance in spontaneously breathing patients, and thus the ventilator should be able to adapt to patient's changes in ventilatory demand and respiratory mechanics. Nevertheless, a lack of coordination between patient and ventilator due to a mismatch between neural and ventilator timing throughout the respiratory cycle may make weaning difficult and lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Therefore, appropriate monitoring of asynchronies is mandatory to improve the applied strategies and thus improve patient-ventilator interaction. We conducted a literature review regarding patient-ventilator interaction with a focus on the different kinds of inspiratory and expiratory asynchronies, their monitoring, clinical implications, possible prevention, and treatment. We believe that monitoring patient-ventilator interaction is mandatory in spontaneously breathing patients to understand, by using the available technologies, the type of asynchrony and consequently improve the adaptation of the ventilator to the patient's needs. Asynchronies are relatively frequent during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients, and they are associated with poor outcomes. This review summarizes the different types of asynchronies and their mechanisms, consequences, and potential management. The development and understanding of monitoring tools are necessary to allow a better appraisal of this area, which may lead to better outcomes for patients.

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^112Hig2P]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Fighting with the machine: patient-ventilator asynchrony

Asynchrony has rarely been cited as a direct cause of NIV immediate failure. However, indirect evidence suggests that this may be the case. Asynchrony can easily be detected by a physical examination (e.g. number of spontaneous breaths vs. ventilator-delivered breaths, accessory muscle use) of the patient and symptoms (e.g. dyspnea). Two main causes of asynchrony are a high level of ventilator support and an increased number of leaks.

A number of strategies can be implemented to avoid "gross asynchronies", such as optimization of ventilator settings using the screen ventilator waveforms, adjusting trigger sensitivity, increasing positive end-expiratory pressure, minimizing leaks, using different modes or more sophisticated ventilators. New modes of ventilation, such as neutrally adjusted ventilator assist, have been documented to reduce asynchrony.

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several areas of uncertainty that warrant further research. Little is known about long-term outcomes in ECMO survivors. Pooled data from existing studies suggest that ECMO survivors may have greater decrements in health-related quality of life than patients who were managed with conventional mechanical ventilation, although these findings are limited by small sample sizes and significant heterogeneity in outcome measures and timing of follow-up. It is crucial to understand whether increased survival comes with a potential increase in disability because this may have implications for patient preferences, cost effectiveness, and general utility of ECMO. Additionally, there are limited data regarding appropriate supportive measures for patients receiving ECMO, such as early mobilization and ventilator management. Further research is needed to understand if approaches to these aspects of care should differ from those used for patients who are treated with conventional mechanical ventilation. Finally, additional studies are needed to address the impact of ECMO on resource allocation in different settings and healthcare systems.

Question 3: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Neuromuscular Blockade?

Recommendation

We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty)

Background

NMBAs are a commonly used adjunctive therapy for patients with ARDS. The mechanism of benefit is unclear, but likely involves decreasing ventilator-induced lung injury via a reduction in patient–ventilator dyssynchrony in addition to reducing oxygen consumption, inflammation, and alveolar fluid. NMBAs were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, increasing use and evolving evidence prompted the committee to evaluate NMBAs for the new guidelines.

### The association between patient-ventilator asynchrony and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^115RHCuq]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This systematic review highlights the clinical relevance of PVA by demonstrating associations with prolonged MV and ICU length of stay. Despite its limitations, the findings underscore the importance of addressing PVA in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. This review serves as a hypothesis-generating analysis, suggesting that PVA, particularly ineffective triggering and double triggering, may contribute to worse clinical outcomes. However, due to methodological differences in the studies reviewed, a definitive conclusion regarding double triggering's association with clinical outcomes cannot be drawn. Further research, with standardized definitions and methodologies, is needed to confirm these associations and explore the mechanisms behind them. Such studies could refine clinical management strategies for PVA.

### The association between ventilator dyssynchrony, delivered tidal volume, and sedation using a novel automated ventilator dyssynchrony detection algorithm [^116SfL8c]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Ventilator dyssynchrony is potentially harmful to patients with or at risk for the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Automated detection of ventilator dyssynchrony from ventilator waveforms has been difficult. It is unclear if certain types of ventilator dyssynchrony deliver large tidal volumes and whether levels of sedation alter the frequency of ventilator dyssynchrony.

Design

A prospective observational study.

Setting

A university medical ICU.

Patients

Patients with or at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Interventions

Continuous pressure-time, flow-time, and volume-time data were directly obtained from the ventilator. The level of sedation and the use of neuromuscular blockade was extracted from the medical record. Machine learning algorithms that incorporate clinical insight were developed and trained to detect four previously described and clinically relevant forms of ventilator dyssynchrony. The association between normalized tidal volume and ventilator dyssynchrony and the association between sedation and the frequency of ventilator dyssynchrony were determined.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 4.26 million breaths were recorded from 62 ventilated patients. Our algorithm detected three types of ventilator dyssynchrony with an area under the receiver operator curve of greater than 0.89. Ventilator dyssynchrony occurred in 34.4% (95% CI, 34.41–34.49%) of breaths. When compared with synchronous breaths, double-triggered and flow-limited breaths were more likely to deliver tidal volumes greater than 10mL/kg (40% and 11% compared with 0.2%; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Deep sedation reduced but did not eliminate the frequency of all ventilator dyssynchrony breaths (p < 0.05). Ventilator dyssynchrony was eliminated with neuromuscular blockade (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

We developed a computerized algorithm that accurately detects three types of ventilator dyssynchrony. Double-triggered and flow-limited breaths are associated with the frequent delivery of tidal volumes of greater than 10mL/kg. Although ventilator dyssynchrony is reduced by deep sedation, potentially deleterious tidal volumes may still be delivered. However, neuromuscular blockade effectively eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony.

### Flow-limited and reverse-triggered ventilator dyssynchrony are associated with increased tidal and dynamic transpulmonary pressure [^1144pECP]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ventilator dyssynchrony may be associated with increased delivered tidal volumes (V t s) and dynamic transpulmonary pressure (ΔP L, dyn), surrogate markers of lung stress and strain, despite low V t ventilation. However, it is unknown which types of ventilator dyssynchrony are most likely to increase these metrics or if specific ventilation or sedation strategies can mitigate this potential.

Design

A prospective cohort analysis to delineate the association between ten types of breaths and delivered V t, ΔP L, dyn, and transpulmonary mechanical energy.

Setting

Patients admitted to the medical ICU.

Patients

Over 580,000 breaths from 35 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ARDS risk factors.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients received continuous esophageal manometry. Ventilator dyssynchrony was identified using a machine learning algorithm. Mixed-effect models predicted V t, ΔP L, dyn, and transpulmonary mechanical energy for each type of ventilator dyssynchrony while controlling for repeated measures. Finally, we described how V t, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and sedation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) strategies modify ventilator dyssynchrony's association with these surrogate markers of lung stress and strain. Double-triggered breaths were associated with the most significant increase in V t, ΔP L, dyn, and transpulmonary mechanical energy. However, flow-limited, early reverse-triggered, and early ventilator-terminated breaths were also associated with significant increases in V t, ΔP L, dyn, and energy. The potential of a ventilator dyssynchrony type to increase V t, ΔP L, dyn, or energy clustered similarly. Increasing set V t may be associated with a disproportionate increase in high-volume and high-energy ventilation from double-triggered breaths, but PEEP and sedation do not clinically modify the interaction between ventilator dyssynchrony and surrogate markers of lung stress and strain.

Conclusions

Double-triggered, flow-limited, early reverse-triggered, and early ventilator-terminated breaths are associated with increases in V t, ΔP L, dyn, and energy. As flow-limited breaths are more than twice as common as double-triggered breaths, further work is needed to determine the interaction of ventilator dyssynchrony frequency to cause clinically meaningful changes in patient outcomes.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

Future studies are needed to evaluate the merits of additional lung-protective strategies (e.g. limited driving pressure or plateau pressure, elastance normalized to PBW, appropriate levels of PEEP) and personalized ventilator targets, particularly the trade-off between tidal volume and respiratory rate to control the overall intensity of mechanical ventilation balanced by the risks of very low tidal volumes (e.g. sedation, dyssynchrony etc.) in patients with lower lung elastance. Long-term multidimensional outcomes for patients and families should be included, and the views of patients and caregivers should be central to determining future research questions and outcomes.

The key research questions to be addressed in future trials include investigation of: (1) the optimal manner to assess whether a given ventilator strategy is likely to worsen VILI, (2) the manner in which we determine optimal Vt (e.g. based on PBW, on driving pressure, or an alternative approach), (3) personalized lung-protective ventilatory strategies based on the physiology of individual patients, and (4) other approaches to remove PaCO 2 if the current ventilator strategy is highly likely to worsen VILI.

### Assisted mechanical ventilation: the future is now! [^1138ZfZs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asynchrony can be categorized into four general types: flow asynchrony; trigger asynchrony; cycle asynchrony; and mode asynchrony. With flow asynchrony, the gas delivery pattern from the ventilator does not match the inspiratory pattern of the patient. Thus, when the patient's inspiratory flow exceeds the ventilator's delivered flow, patient effort and work of breathing increase stimulating an increased respiratory rate. This type of asynchrony is much more common during volume ventilation than pressure ventilation.

Trigger asynchrony can be of several forms: trigger delay; missed triggering; auto-triggering; or double triggering. Trigger delay can occur in any mode as a result of poor setting of the trigger sensitivity. Missed triggering is primarily a result of auto-PEEP. Auto-triggering, a result of inappropriate setting of the trigger sensitivity, system leaks, or a hyperdynamic cardiac output (as sometimes observed in post cardiac surgical patients), can also occur in any mode. Double triggering occurs when the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator is less than that demanded by the respiratory center or when the inspiratory time set on the ventilator is shorter than the neuro-inspiratory time. Double triggering is most common with volume ventilation.

Cycle asynchrony occurs when the inspiratory time of the patient and the ventilator do not match and is referred to as short cycling or long cycling. This form of asynchrony is most common during pressure ventilation but may also cause double triggering in volume ventilation.

Mode asynchrony occurs when the selected mode results in a significant level of asynchrony.

Recently, increased attention has been given to the presence of asynchrony in mechanically ventilated patients. Data would indicate that all patients ventilated in assisted ventilation have periods of asynchrony and that in many the level of asynchrony can be excessive. A number of groups have shown that an asynchrony index greater than or equal to 10% (total number of asynchronous breaths/total triggered and untriggered breathes ×100) is associated with an increased length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and mortality. The potential impact of asynchrony on patient outcome has been generally underappreciated by the practicing clinician.

### Patient-ventilator trigger dys-synchrony: a common phenomenon with important implications [^115K4DDw]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Patient-ventilator trigger dys-synchronies are common with the use of assisted forms of mechanical ventilatory support, including non-invasive mechanical ventilatory support (NIV). Future system designs need to address this in order to improve the effectiveness of NIV.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^113sEZKB]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations frequently exhibit patient-ventilator dyssynchrony resulting from dynamic hyperinflation and high inspiratory flow demands, and dyssynchrony has been associated with increased work of breathing, worse hyperinflation, and poor clinical outcomes. One of the most common forms is trigger dyssynchrony, in which the patient's inspiratory effort is unable to overcome both the ventilator trigger threshold and PEEPi to trigger a ventilator-assisted breath. Trigger dyssynchrony can be managed by increasing PEEP to match PEEPi better (among patients who are PEEP responders) or decreasing the trigger threshold. Routine administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is not recommended because of the risk of myopathy, particularly with concurrent corticosteroid use; however, these agents can be considered on a case-by-case basis to reduce patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, risk of barotrauma, and oxygen consumption among patients who exhibit persistent dyssynchrony despite ventilator optimization and adequate sedation. –
