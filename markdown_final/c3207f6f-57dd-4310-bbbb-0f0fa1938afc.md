## Question

When can you restart anticoagulation after a bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to restart anticoagulation after a major bleeding event. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the original indication for anticoagulation and whether it persists. Then, I should verify the bleeding site and severity, including whether it was a critical-site bleed. Next, I will assess thrombotic and bleeding risk using validated tools and patient-specific modifiers. After that, I need to determine whether to restart at all, and if so, the optimal timing and agent selection, including any bridging or DOAC-specific considerations. Finally, I should outline monitoring, mitigation strategies, and special scenarios like ICH, GI bleeding, and peri-procedural contexts, ensuring shared decision-making at each step.

> Let me first confirm the original indication for anticoagulation and whether it remains valid, because if the indication has resolved, discontinuation may be appropriate. For example, a first provoked VTE more than 3 months ago, a bioprosthetic valve beyond 3 months without atrial fibrillation, or a CHA2DS2-VASc score below 2 in men or below 3 in women may no longer warrant ongoing therapy, and I should explicitly document this before moving forward [^116E29ii] [^111cBg6Z].

> Wait, let me verify the bleeding characteristics next, since site and severity drive both the decision to restart and the timing. I need to distinguish critical-site bleeding such as intracranial hemorrhage from noncritical sites like gastrointestinal bleeding, and I should confirm whether the bleed was major by ISTH criteria, whether the source has been identified and definitively treated, and whether any planned procedures could delay resumption, because these factors materially change risk-benefit calculus [^116v9ZUs] [^1156PqbL].

> I will now examine thrombotic risk using CHA2DS2-VASc for atrial fibrillation and validated models for VTE recurrence, and I should double-check bleeding risk with HAS-BLED or OBRI, while remembering that these scores were not designed for the immediate post-bleed context. Importantly, I need to identify modifiable contributors such as supratherapeutic INR, renal dysfunction elevating DOAC levels, interacting drugs, or concomitant antiplatelet therapy, and I should correct these before restarting to mitigate recurrence risk [^113pugHg] [^111cBg6Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply stopping anticoagulation. In most patients with a persistent indication, resuming anticoagulation provides net clinical benefit despite higher rebleeding risk, with large observational datasets showing substantially lower thromboembolism and mortality when anticoagulation is resumed after GI bleeding, so I should frame the default as restart unless contraindications exist [^111skhBk] [^112UdKpD].

> Let me think about timing next, and I should confirm that the optimal window balances early rebleeding risk against rising thrombotic risk. For gastrointestinal bleeding, most data support resuming around 7 to 14 days after hemostasis, with earlier resumption reasonable in high thrombotic risk patients, whereas for intracranial hemorrhage, guidelines generally favor delaying 4 to 8 weeks in atrial fibrillation patients after careful risk-benefit assessment, acknowledging that some expert groups allow earlier consideration in select high-risk scenarios [^111skhBk] [^111sMREj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DOACs could be restarted as early as 3 to 5 days after GI bleeding in high thrombotic risk patients, but I should double-check that. ESGE/BSG suggest that for very high thrombotic risk, earlier resumption with heparin bridging within about 3 days may be considered, yet for DOACs specifically, the rapid onset means I need to be cautious and align with the 7 to 14 day framework in most cases, reserving earlier starts for exceptional circumstances with multidisciplinary agreement and close monitoring [^111skhBk] [^113vWtjf].

> For intracranial hemorrhage, I should confirm that the decision to restart is individualized and that timing is typically delayed. AHA/ASA suggests approximately 7 to 8 weeks for AF patients after weighing patient-specific risks, while some trauma and neurosurgical sources describe ranges from 2 weeks up to 30 weeks depending on thrombotic and rebleeding risk, and I must remember that DOACs have lower ICH risk than warfarin in general AF populations, though data after prior ICH are limited and patients with lobar hemorrhage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy may have higher recurrence risk, arguing for more conservative timing or alternative strategies [^111LuUHf] [^1115sZif] [^1173VW3j].

> I need to ensure agent selection reflects both thrombotic indication and bleeding phenotype. DOACs are reasonable for nonvalvular AF and VTE given lower intracranial hemorrhage rates versus warfarin, and if the index bleed was GI, apixaban may have a more favorable GI bleeding profile than some other DOACs, whereas mechanical valves still require warfarin. If a reversible cause like supratherapeutic INR or drug interaction is identified, switching to a different anticoagulant class may reduce recurrence risk [^111TDL7E] [^112n2Atw] [^114rHUnb].

> But wait, what if the patient is at very high thrombotic risk and cannot safely wait for full oral anticoagulation? In that case, I should consider short-term parenteral bridging with unfractionated heparin given its short half-life and reversibility, while avoiding routine bridging for DOACs post-procedurally and tailoring the intensity to the evolving bleeding risk, with frequent reassessment for early transition back to oral therapy [^1127gUxn] [^1122fZyw].

> Next, I should review mitigation strategies that reduce rebleeding without sacrificing thrombotic protection. For GI bleeding, high-dose PPI therapy, Helicobacter pylori eradication when indicated, and endoscopic hemostasis reduce recurrence, and for ICH, strict blood pressure control is essential. I also need to reassess concomitant antiplatelet therapy, often favoring continuation of aspirin for secondary prevention while minimizing or discontinuing P2Y12 inhibitors when feasible, and I should coordinate with cardiology if coronary stents are present to balance stent thrombosis risk against bleeding [^115uhTkR] [^111LuUHf].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up, and I should confirm a plan for early clinical review within 1 to 2 weeks after restart to check for occult bleeding, hemoglobin trends, renal function if on a DOAC, and any new symptoms. Given the lack of validated post-bleed risk scores, I must rely on vigilant clinical surveillance and patient education to report warning signs promptly, adjusting therapy if new risk factors emerge [^111cBg6Z] [^112gxF8q].

> Let me consider special scenarios carefully. For traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, expert opinion increasingly supports restarting anticoagulation in most patients, but the unresolved question is timing, with ongoing randomized trials comparing 1 week versus 4 weeks, so I should individualize based on hematoma stability, neurosurgical input, and thrombotic risk while acknowledging uncertainty [^114AwjXS] [^113UHVRU]. For peri-procedural management, I should align with procedural risk tiers and generally restart anticoagulation within 12 to 24 hours for low to intermediate risk procedures and 24 to 48 hours for high risk once hemostasis is secure, avoiding bridging with DOACs and using UFH selectively for very high thrombotic risk if needed [^11619KHx] [^1122fZyw].

> Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is embedded throughout. Patients and families need to understand that while restarting anticoagulation increases rebleeding risk, it typically lowers the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and death, and this trade-off should be documented explicitly, especially when deviating from standard timing or choosing alternative strategies like LAA occlusion in select AF patients with prohibitive bleeding risk [^115BNW12] [^111cBg6Z].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm the persistent indication, classify the bleed and achieve durable hemostasis, quantify thrombotic and bleeding risks with attention to modifiable factors, default to restarting anticoagulation when indicated, choose timing by bleed site with 7 to 14 days reasonable after GI bleeding and 4 to 8 weeks typical after ICH, select the agent based on indication and bleed phenotype, consider parenteral bridging only in select high-risk scenarios, implement mitigation strategies, and monitor closely with shared decision-making, adjusting the plan as the patient's risk evolves [^116fSqcC] [^111hYJgh] [^111sMREj].

Restart anticoagulation after a bleed using a **shared decision-making** approach that balances thrombotic and bleeding risks [^115BNW12]. For gastrointestinal bleeding, resume anticoagulation **7–14 days** after hemostasis to reduce thromboembolism and mortality with manageable rebleeding risk [^111hYJgh] [^111skhBk]. For intracranial hemorrhage, delay **4–8 weeks** unless thrombotic risk is very high, then consider earlier resumption with specialist input [^111sMREj] [^111LuUHf]. For nonmajor bleeding, restart once hemostasis is confirmed [^113ChN9x]. Always correct reversible bleeding causes, consider switching to a lower-bleeding-risk agent (e.g. apixaban) [^1132E9aM], and monitor closely after restart [^111cBg6Z].

---

## General principles for restarting anticoagulation

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in decisions, discussing risks, benefits, and preferences [^115BNW12].

- **Correct reversible causes**: Address modifiable bleeding risks (e.g. high INR, drug interactions, renal dysfunction) before restarting [^111cBg6Z].

- **Individualized risk assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED) to guide timing and agent selection [^113pugHg].

---

## Timing of anticoagulation resumption by bleeding type

| **Bleeding type** | **Recommended timing for resumption** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding | 7–14 days after hemostasis | High [^1132E9aM] [^115yg3fA] |
| Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) | 4–8 weeks after hemostasis | High [^111sMREj] [^1115sZif] |
| Nonmajor bleeding | Resume once hemostasis confirmed | High [^113ChN9x] |

---

### Gastrointestinal bleeding

- **Optimal timing**: 7–14 days after hemostasis reduces thromboembolism and mortality without excess rebleeding [^115aUF6o] [^1132E9aM].

- **High thrombotic risk**: Consider earlier resumption (≤ 7 days) with close monitoring [^111skhBk].

- **Agent selection**: Apixaban may lower GI bleeding risk vs other DOACs [^1132E9aM].

---

### Intracranial hemorrhage

- **General recommendation**: Delay 4–8 weeks to balance thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks [^111sMREj].

- **High thrombotic risk**: Consider earlier resumption (1–2 weeks) with specialist input [^1173VW3j].

- **Agent selection**: DOACs have lower ICH risk than warfarin; consider switching [^116PfABU].

---

### Nonmajor bleeding

For nonmajor bleeding, **immediate resumption** is appropriate once hemostasis is confirmed [^113ChN9x], whereas **temporary interruption** may be considered for a few days if bleeding risk remains high [^112gxF8q].

---

## Risk stratification tools and clinical judgment

- **CHA2DS2-VASc**: Assess thrombotic risk in AF; higher scores favor earlier resumption [^113pugHg].

- **HAS-BLED**: Identify bleeding risk factors; higher scores caution delay or dose adjustment [^113pugHg].

- **Clinical judgment**: Integrate patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, bleed severity, agent choice) [^115an9bH].

---

## Role of anticoagulant reversal agents

Idarucizumab rapidly reverses dabigatran and is used for **life-threatening bleeding** [^116BxmED]; andexanet alfa reverses factor Xa inhibitors and is likewise reserved for **major bleeding** [^116BxmED]. Reversal does not preclude later **restarting anticoagulation** once hemostasis is achieved [^116v9ZUs].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular visits** to detect recurrent bleeding or thromboembolism after resumption, with **lab monitoring** (INR for VKAs; renal function for DOACs) to guide dosing and detect interactions [^111cBg6Z].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical heart valves**: VKAs remain standard; DOACs are contraindicated [^111TDL7E].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid DOACs; use VKAs or LMWH with specialist guidance.

- **Elderly patients**: Higher bleeding risk; consider lower doses and closer monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **GI bleeding**: Resume 7–14 days after hemostasis; earlier if high thrombotic risk [^1132E9aM] [^111skhBk].

- **ICH**: Delay 4–8 weeks; earlier only if thrombotic risk is very high [^111sMREj] [^111LuUHf].

- **Nonmajor bleeding**: Resume once hemostasis confirmed [^113ChN9x].

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential to align treatment with patient values and risk profile [^115BNW12].

---

Restarting anticoagulation after bleeding requires a **personalized, risk-balanced approach** [^115an9bH]. For GI bleeding, **7–14 days** after hemostasis is optimal; for ICH, **4–8 weeks** is preferred unless thrombotic risk is very high. Always correct reversible causes, consider agent switching, and monitor closely.

2. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and re-initiation of OACs

Gastrointestinal bleeding also has a diverse etiology (eg, hemorrhagic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis), but has generally been studied as a single cohort. Again, etiology plays a role in recurrence risk, but it is difficult to parse out. Acute GI bleeds related to both VKA 34 and DOAC therapy are more common in the upper GI tract. Data from an open cohort study (upper GI bleed n = 21,641) gave an age-standardized incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) for upper GI tract bleeding of 5.8 in those prescribed warfarin and 2.7 in those prescribed DOACs. A meta-analysis of data from 11 phase 3 randomized controlled trials reported no significant difference in the overall incidence of major GI bleeding between DOACs and VKAs (relative risk 0.94; p = 0.62). There is evidence, some of it prospective, that restarting OAC therapy after GI hemorrhage is beneficial.

A prospective observational study in the United States identified 197 patients who developed GI bleeding while receiving systemic anticoagulation (145/197 [74%] received warfarin), of whom 76 (39%) discontinued anticoagulation upon hospital discharge (ie, interruption of anticoagulation for ≥ 72 hours after discharge). Restarting OAC therapy at hospital discharge was associated with a lower risk of major thrombotic episodes within 90 days (HR 0.121; 95% CI, 0.006–0.812; p = 0.03), and no significant difference in mortality was observed (at 90 days, HR 0.632; 95% CI, 0.216–1.89; p = 0.40). Furthermore, restarting OAC was not significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding at 90 days (HR 2.17; 95% CI, 0.861–6.67; p = 0.10).

### Timing to restart direct oral anticoagulants after… [^113KDLiD]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing to Restart Direct Oral Anticoagulants After Traumatic Intracranial Haemorrhage ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Older people falling from a standing height is the most common cause of hospital admission for head injury. Up to 1 in 3 patients admitted are taking a tablet medication which thins the blood, known as an oral anticoagulant. This type of medication can increase the likelihood of bleeding in the brain. Many patients are taking oral anticoagulation due to having an irregular heartbeat or because of having a previous stroke or blood clots. When a scan shows blood in the brain, oral anticoagulation is nearly always stopped. However, this leaves the question of when it is safe to restart them. The risk of making the bleeding in the brain worse must be balanced against the risk of having a stroke or blood clots.

There is no clear evidence on the safest time to restart oral anticoagulation, but most neurosurgeons advise restarting them 1–4 weeks after head injury. The number of people who have a bleed on their brain after a head injury is increasing and further brain bleeding or a stroke can have a serious effect on patients' lives and their on-going healthcare needs. Public and patient groups have highlighted that many patients want to stop taking oral anticoagulation after a bleed but they may be unaware of the vital importance of restarting this medication to prevent strokes and blood clots. The most popular oral anticoagulation prescribed has changed in recent years from warfarin to newer medications called Direct Oral Anti-Coagulants.

This trial will recruit 1084 people who are admitted to hospital with a bleed on the brain caused by a head injury who were taking oral anticoagulation before their head injury and have been prescribed a Direct Oral Anti-Coagulant for previously diagnosed medical condition. Patients on other Oral Anti-Coagulants, such as Warfarin may also be able to take part. The main purpose of the trial is to determine when is most beneficial time for people to start or restart a DOAC after their head injury. People will be asked to start the medication either 1 week or 4 weeks after their head injury. They will be then followed closely for 12 weeks and any major bleeding events or a blood clots such as a stroke or heart attack will be recorded.

The study will also look at the person's overall quality of life, how they recover physically, the number of people who die, the costs of the treatment, and the attitudes of people and their caregivers to starting or restarting a DOAC. It increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and should be considered for treatment with oral anticoagulants OACs depending on risk factor assessment by the CHA2DS2VASc H
- Hypertension A2
- Age ≥ 75 years since 20008 and between 20–35% of older patients admitted with head injury causing intracranial haemorrhage, are taking an OAC at the time of injury. Standard care dictates that OACs should be stopped in the majority of cases to reduce the risk of progressive or new ICrH.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111hYJgh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding — resumption of oral anticoagulation (OAC) is supported by observational evidence showing reduced thromboembolism and mortality but higher rebleeding, and the document states reinitiation is reasonable once hemostasis is achieved. In a systematic review of 12 observational studies (3,098 patients), resumption after OAC‑associated GI bleeding was linked to lower thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68; 9 studies) and lower death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70; 8 studies) but higher recurrent bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48; 11 studies). Additional studies reported discharge‑time restart after a median 5 days with fewer thromboembolic events at 90 days but more bleeding, and warfarin restart > 7 days after a bleed in AF with improved survival and no increase in recurrent GI bleeding; accordingly, "it is reasonable to reinitiate OAC once hemostasis has been achieved".

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^111JZoLr]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial (RESTART) found that antiplatelet therapy appeared to be safe up to 5 years after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) that had occurred during antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy.

Objectives

To monitor adherence, increase duration of follow-up, and improve precision of estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH and major vascular events.

Design, Setting and Participants

From May 22, 2013, through May 31, 2018, this prospective, open, blinded end point, parallel-group randomized clinical trial studied 537 participants at 122 hospitals in the UK. Participants were individuals 18 years or older who had taken antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed ICH, discontinued antithrombotic therapy, and survived for 24 hours. After initial follow-up ended on November 30, 2018, annual follow-up was extended until November 30, 2020, for a median of 3.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0–5.0 years) for the trial cohort.

Interventions

Computerized randomization that incorporated minimization allocated participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were followed up for the primary outcome (recurrent symptomatic ICH) and secondary outcomes (all major vascular events) for up to 7 years. Data from all randomized participants were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for minimization covariates.

Results

A total of 537 patients (median age, 76.0 years; IQR, 69.0–82.0 years; 360 [67.0%] male; median time after ICH onset, 76.0 days; IQR, 29.0–146.0 days) were randomly allocated to start (n = 268) or avoid (n = 269 [1 withdrew]) antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome of recurrent ICH affected 22 of 268 participants (8.2%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 25 of 268 participants (9.3%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49–1.55; p = 0.64). A major vascular event affected 72 participants (26.8%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 87 participants (32.5%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58–1.08; p = 0.14).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with ICH who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy, this study found no statistically significant effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH or all major vascular events. These findings provide physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after ICH if indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^114QAMH1]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and risk factors for thromboembolism require anticoagulant treatment to reduce the risk of stroke. The major complication with anticoagulant treatment is the increased risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.

After patients have experienced gastrointestinal bleeding during antithrombotic treatment, their clinicians face the clinical dilemma of whether to restart treatment or not. Moreover, there are several treatment regimens for clinicians to choose from: single or combined treatment with a vitamin K antagonist, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and an adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor). It is important to clarify how clinicians should treat patients with atrial fibrillation after antithrombotic related gastrointestinal bleeding; however, data on this are scarce, and no randomised controlled trial has been performed to elucidate the clinical dilemma regarding risk of stroke versus risk of bleeding in these patients.

In a nationwide cohort study, we examined the risk of all cause mortality and admission to hospital or deaths due to thromboembolism, major bleeding, or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding associated with restarting antithrombotic treatment after a gastrointestinal bleed in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^115JT2Th]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Restart following surgical intervention of tICrH

tICrH also frequently requires emergent surgical intervention. These patients are already at elevated risk of hematoma expansion as well as subsequent thromboembolic complications. The decision to perform neurosurgical interventions may further alter the subsequent risk profile of recurrent hemorrhage for anticoagulated tICrH. With regard to pre-injury treatment, anticoagulation increases the risks of surgical intervention. In the near term, pre-injury anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment was not associated with acute, postoperative hemorrhage in a retrospective study of 143 neurosurgical (craniotomy and craniectomy) patients.VKA relative to DOAC, antiplatelets or controls has been associated with greater reversal agent use, hematoma expansion and mortality, but unrelated to the need for surgical intervention. Another study demonstrated that DOAC treatment pre-injury was associated with greater likelihood of neurosurgical intervention. However, a larger study of chronic SDH evacuation demonstrated that cases on preoperative anticoagulation therapy were more likely to experience major hemorrhage during follow-up (OR = 1.93, p = 0.014), and the time to occurrence of either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications was shorter.

With regard to reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy, the use of DOAC therapy or heparin has been recommended over VKA, based on evidence of lower risk of ICrH in non-bleeding populations. There is a real scarcity of evidence for any relationship between surgical treatment for tICrH and the decision to restart anticoagulation. Here as well, selection bias is an obvious concern with any retrospective, observational research into the question of restart. This may partly explain associations found between reinitiation and reduced risk of hemorrhage in unadjusted analyses. In cases with elevated risk of thromboembolic events, reinitiation as early as 3 days postinjury has also been suggested. However, the overall strategy for how to manage anticoagulant-associated ICrH after surgery is unclear.

### Post-intracranial hemorrhage antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111zUubF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of thromboembolism, particularly those with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2; therefore, oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is recommended commonly according to different guidelines. However, OAC therapy increases the risk of bleeding. Thus, after the occurrence of an intracranial hemorrhage episode, OAC agents should be discontinued immediately. Reinitiating antithrombotic therapy (AT) after the episode is a difficult decision, which requires balancing the risk of re‐bleeding and occurrence of thromboembolism. To date, there has been little research on whether or when to start AT and the drug of choice.

According to the report of RESTART (Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial) conducted in 2019, reinitiating antiplatelet therapy after an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) episode, compared with no treatment, did not increase the risk of ICH and major hemorrhagic events. Nevertheless, < 20% of participants in the RESTART trial had AF. Several retrospective observational studies have investigated the effectiveness and safety of reinitiating AT among patients with AF and a history of intracranial hemorrhage. A Danish study showed that reinitiating anticoagulants was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and all‐cause mortality compared with no treatment. Another Korean study showed that maintaining time in the therapeutic range of 60% among warfarin starters post‐intracranial hemorrhage, compared with no treatment, significantly reduced the risk of composite outcome of thromboembolic and major bleeding events. Contrarily, a Taiwanese study showed that initiating warfarin, compared with no treatment, significantly reduced the risk of IS but increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

Large‐scale, randomized, prospective studies have proven that non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are equivalently effective to warfarin in preventing thromboembolism among patients with AF; additionally, they significantly reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. However, patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage have been universally excluded from these studies. In addition, warfarin has been a major OAC evaluated in prior studies. To date, data on the effectiveness and safety of reinitiating NOACs subsequent to an intracranial hemorrhage episode are lacking.

The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of withholding or reinitiating AT in patients with AF and a history of intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, we compared different treatment strategies: OAC therapy versus no treatment, antiplatelet therapy versus no treatment, OAC therapy versus antiplatelet therapy, and NOAC versus warfarin.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^114kBqsz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A further report, in which 7 clinical experts assessed scenarios concerning acute reversal and resumption of OAC in the setting of warfarin-associated ICH, revealed that expert opinion favored OAC resumption within 3–10 days of ICH if the patient was stable and anticoagulation was mandatory. A shorter time to restarting OAC therapy, as early as 72 hours post-bleed, was also recommended in a review of 63 publications that described 492 patients with warfarin-associated central nervous system hemorrhage (including spinal hemorrhage).

Lastly, a retrospective review (1976–1999) of 141 patients with ICH at high thromboembolic risk (OAC indications: mechanical heart valve, AF, and prior stroke) found that discontinuation of warfarin for 1–2 weeks (median time not receiving warfarin 10 days; range 0–30 days) had a comparatively low probability of embolic events, and there was no recurrence of ICH at 30 days for the 35 patients who were restarted on OAC.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^113vWtjf]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Correction of coagulopathy, when required, should not delay urgent endoscopic or radiological interventions when indicated, as these procedures can be safely and effectively performed at therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in the context of acute haemorrhage.

After bleeding cessation, observational studiesand two meta-analysesconsistently indicate there is a net clinical benefit of restarting anticoagulation, due to a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, despite an increased risk of rebleeding. However, evidence on the optimal timing for restarting anticoagulation is limited. A single retrospective study indicates an excess risk of GI bleeding and of thromboembolism for an interval of warfarin interruption shorter than 7 days and longer than 30 days, respectively. Since there is a trend toward a reduced incidence of thromboembolic events the earlier warfarin is introduced, it is reasonable to restart warfarin as soon as possible by day seven following its interruption. Data on the optimal timing of DOAC resumption are lacking. In analogy with warfarin, restarting DOACs as soon as possible by day seven after their interruption seems reasonable in most cases. The DOAC rapid onset of action, resulting in a full anticoagulation within 2–4 hours, warrants some caution with an earlier resumption.

In patients at very high thrombotic risk (eg, prosthetic metal heart valve in mitral position), cardiology societies recommend an earlier resumption of anticoagulation with UFH in those at highest risk, rapid titration of prophylactic doses of LMWH to therapeutic doses within 48–72 hours. The choice of strategy should be discussed with the patient's cardiologist. If the risk of restarting anticoagulation is estimated to outweigh the benefits, a consultation with the referral specialist (haematologist, neurologist and/or cardiologist) is advisable, and alternatives to anticoagulation, such as a left atrial appendage occlusion in AF, or inferior vena cava filter for acute deep venous thrombosis, may be considered.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115L4cpq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to management of bleeding, resumption of anticoagulation, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider resuming oral anticoagulation after correction of reversible causes of bleeding in a major gastrointestinal bleeding event and reassessment of its long-term benefits and risks with a multidisciplinary team approach in shared decision-making with patients.

Regarding medical management for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, DOACs, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider restarting DOAC therapy at a maximum of 7 days after bleeding.

### Timing of anticoagulation restart after serious bleeding in atrial fibrillation [^112HqmDw]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Restarting direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) after a serious bleeding event in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) presents a clinical dilemma, with limited evidence on the balance between stroke prevention and recurrent bleeding risk.

Methods

Using nationwide Danish registries (2012–2021), we identified AF patients (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65–74, and Sex category (female) (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2)) who experienced a first serious bleeding event while on DOAC therapy. Patients were grouped by timing of DOAC restart: within 60 days ('early restarters') vs after 60 days ('late restarters'). HRs for stroke, recurrent bleeding and a composite endpoint (stroke or serious bleeding) were estimated using multivariable Cox models. A secondary analysis examined outcomes across six time-varying antithrombotic treatment regimens.

Results

Among 10291 patients who survived 60 days postbleeding, 5970 restarted DOAC early and 4321 later. The early restart group had a lower rate of stroke (HR 0.89; 95%CI 0.74 to 1.08), but the interval includes both moderate benefit and no clear difference, indicating uncertainty in the stroke reduction. Recurrent bleeding was more frequent in early restarters (HR 1.21; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.36). In the time-varying analysis, DOAC monotherapy was associated with reduced stroke risk compared with no treatment (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.68 to 0.89). However, bleeding risk was also higher during DOAC monotherapy (HR 1.26; 95%CI 1.15 to 1.38).

Conclusions

Restarting DOACs early after a serious bleeding event in AF patients may reduce stroke risk but is associated with an increased risk of recurrent bleeding. DOAC monotherapy appears to offer the best stroke protection, though with elevated bleeding risk. These findings highlight the need for individualised decision-making and further trials to define optimal timing for DOAC resumption.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114gNWCJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines

Current trauma guidelines do not address the use of anticoagulant treatment after ICrH. The 2014 update to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for stroke prevention in stroke and temporary ischemic attack includes a special section on the use of antithrombotic therapy after ICrH. These guidelines clearly demonstrate shortcomings of the available evidence as they endorse individualized assessment of the restart decision. To this end, they advise consideration of the risks of subsequent thromboembolism, recurrent ICrH and overall 'patient status'. It subsequently suggests that cases with higher risk of recurrent ICH relative to cerebral infarction may consider antiplatelet therapy instead of anticoagulation. With regard to timing of anticoagulation reinitiation, 'the optimal timing is uncertain. For most patients, however, it might be reasonable to wait ≥ 1 week'. None of the evidence provided rises above class IIb, level B in strength.

The European Stroke Organization also released guidelines in 2014 for sICH, which recognize a lack of trial evidence on this subject. The guidelines state that a firm recommendation about whether or when to resume antithrombotic medication after ICH cannot be made, and rate the evidence as 'very low' quality. The timing suggestions reviewed by that committee range from 14 days up to 30 weeks.

An Austrian expert-consensus panel focused exclusively on traumatic brain injury found that there was 'insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption' of oral anticoagulation following tICrH and that clinical decisions should be made on a 'case-by-case basis'. In spite of this, the practice of restarting anticoagulation in tICrH is far more common than with spontaneous cases as the decision of whether to resume treatment appears already to have been answered in most patients with tICrH and transformed into clinical practice.

### Delphi consensus statement for the management of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding [^112s2gy9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation resumption

Statement 18
SEED recommends resuming anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants) following delayed post-polypectomy bleeding in patients with an indication for anticoagulation.
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. (Strongly agree: 82.1%; agree: 17.9%)
Statement 19
SEED suggests resuming anticoagulants following delayed post-polypectomy bleeding on day 7 or earlier. In patients with high thrombotic risk, anticoagulation should preferably be restarted within 72 hours, provided hemostasis has been achieved.
Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. (Strongly agree: 57.7%; agree: 34.6%)

Overall, current recommendations suggest resumption within 7 days of the bleeding event, given the overall benefit in reducing thromboembolic complications. According to the ESGE, it is reasonable to restart warfarin and DOACs from day 7 onwards in patients at low thrombotic risk after interruption. In those with high thrombotic risk, heparin bridging is recommended, preferably within 72 h.

The benefits of resuming anticoagulation after hospitalization for LGIB are well established. In a large cohort study of patients experiencing diverticular hemorrhage, discontinuation of anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, while no significant association was found with rebleeding. Similarly, in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation, resumption of VKAs or DOACs following LGIB was linked to a lower hazard of all-cause mortality and a comparable risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding compared to those who did not resume anticoagulation. An analysis of patients from the UK audit of LGIB on anti-thrombotics revealed that rebleeding rates in the DOAC (20.0%) and warfarin groups (23.1%) were similar to the unexposed group (19.4%). The use of DOACs or warfarin was not associated with either in-hospital rebleeding or hospital readmission due to further bleeding. Moreover, an analysis of 150 patients with LGIB while on anticoagulants found that resumption of anticoagulation was not associated with recurrent bleeding. When the cohort was expanded to include all patients with GIB, resumption of anticoagulation was linked to a reduced risk of ischemic events during follow-up and decreased mortality.

If any apply, it says "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation (see Figure 6)", and if none apply, it says "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". OAC is defined as oral anticoagulant, including VKAs and DOACs.

### Effect of oral anticoagulant therapy on adverse outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after intracranial hemorrhage [^115aK5Dt]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal management of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains uncertain. Although recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated this clinical dilemma, findings have been inconclusive.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of restarting OACs in in AF patients after ICH, we conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs.

Methods

We conducted literature search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), identifying eligible RCTs from inception to March 2025. The primary outcomes were recurrent ICH and stroke or systemic embolism (SSE). Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model.

Results

Three RCTs (APACHE-AF, SoSTART, and PRESTIGE-AF), comprising a total of 623 patients with a median follow-up of 1.2 to 1.9 years, were included. Most patients received direct oral anticoagulants. Compared with non-OAC therapy, OAC resumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrent ICH (RR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.28–8.61) and major bleeding (RR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.54–7.22), without a significant reduction in SSE (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38–1.23). No significant differences were observed in ischemic stroke, major vascular events, all-cause mortality, or cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusion

In AF patients with prior ICH, restarting OAC therapy is associated with increased risks of recurrent ICH and major bleeding, without a corresponding reduction in thromboembolic events or all-cause mortality.

Restart of anticoagulation — Begin by asking, "Does the patient fall into 1 of the following groups?": NPO, awaiting an invasive procedure, pregnancy, high risk of rebleeding, or being bridged back to VKA with high thrombotic risk (see Table 6). If yes, suggest temporary or long-term parenteral anticoagulation. If no, determine if the patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy; if so, reassess the need for aspirin in stable CAD and reassess the need for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients after PCI and/or ACS and consider discontinuation of aspirin. Next, evaluate whether the patient is taking concurrent medications that interact with OAC levels (e.g., antiretrovirals, antifungals, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics); if present, suggest pharmacy consultation and consideration of switching either OAC or the interacting medication. If no interacting medications are identified, suggest restarting anticoagulation, then choose OAC and consider switching OAC if a reversible cause related to the OAC contributed to the bleed (e.g., high INR, renal function variation). After resumption, if bleeding reoccurred, reassess the severity of the bleed (see Figure 2).

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^111skhBk]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

We recommend restarting anticoagulation following acute GI haemorrhage in patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). In patients at low thrombotic risk, we suggest restarting anticoagulation as soon as possible after 7 days of anticoagulant interruption (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). In those at high-thrombotic risk, an earlier resumption of anticoagulation with heparin bridging, preferably within 3 days, is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

Anticoagulant use is reported in up to 15% and 25% of patients presenting with acute upper and lower GI bleeding, respectively.GI bleeding-related mortality in these patients is high (up to 8%–12%), but mainly related to patients' comorbidities. Anticoagulants are independent predictors of neither mortality nor in-hospital rebleeding, provided they are managed appropriately. Temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation is the 'standard of care' in patients with clinically significant GI bleeding.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^1156PqbL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are multiple definitions for assessing the severity of bleeding episodes. Major hemorrhage is defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis as fatal bleeding, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L or 2 g/dL) or more, or leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or red cells. Consequently, patients enrolled into studies of OAC-associated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined major bleeding consist of a heterogeneous population arising from different clinical specialties, which compounds the difficulties of studying these scenarios. Estimates of the risk of major hemorrhage related to OAC range from 2% to 3% in clinical trials to approximately 1% to 7% in population cohort studies. The exact incidence of major hemorrhage is unknown because of uncertainty regarding the intensity of OAC therapy, and patient-related factors such as history of bleeding, concomitant disease, alcohol use, age, and risk of falls. Regarding types of major hemorrhage related to OAC, the largest amount of published data is for ICH and GI bleeding, and this review will focus on these 2 clinical entities. Recommendations for restarting OAC therapy in other major bleeding situations, which are relatively rare, will remain as risk–benefit decisions for the individual clinician and patient.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^112Uf3ms]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence rates of atrial fibrillation (AF) in North America were estimated at 264 per 100,000 person-years for men and 196 per 100,000 person-years for women in 2010, and approximately 76 million prescriptions for oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy for all indications were dispensed in the United States during 2013. Yet OACs are underused in many patients with AF, and an elevated risk of stroke, contrary to the recommendations of multiple current guidelines, – with rates of OAC prescribing in appropriately risk-stratified patients ranging from 40% to 60%. The most common complication of OAC therapy is gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but the main cause of bleeding-related morbidity and mortality is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). – Physicians consistently underestimate the risk of stroke in patients with AF and overestimate the risk of hemorrhage with OAC therapy, leading to under-treatment, despite evidence of the benefits of OACs. This bias is exacerbated once a patient suffers a major hemorrhage while receiving OAC therapy, particularly for clinicians involved in the acute care of these episodes, as the bleeding is apparent and dramatic, while the stroke that may be prevented by OAC therapy is not. Although often counterintuitive, restarting OACs after OAC-associated major hemorrhage is usually appropriate; however, the main issue concerns the timing of the restart. Evidence-based data from prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials to address this question are needed, particularly in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-treated patients but are unavailable at present.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^111HSCdk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The review of PubMed returned 509 articles, with 17 retained following title and abstract review. Searching available clinical guidelines provided 3 relevant guidelines (out of 184 results) and 12 additional references. The remaining references (24) were identified from review of pertinent bibliographies and Google Scholar.

Equipoise

Much of the available evidence on restart of anticoagulation therapy after ICrH comes from sICrH data. In this context, the equipoise is on whether (rather than when) to restart anticoagulation. In tICrH, primarily cared for by trauma surgeons and neurosurgeons, the equipoise is shifted to when to resume anticoagulation in most patients. Clinicians who care for tICrH see the traumatic episode as largely isolated, perhaps influenced by fall risk, although only to a very small degree (295 falls per year to offset anticoagulant benefit). Otherwise, it is largely disconnected from the baseline risk–benefit ratio for anticoagulation. A global survey of 228 neurologists, neurosurgeons and thrombosis experts found 98% believed patients with tICrH should be restarted (see figure 2) but demonstrated wide variability as to when, noting 'randomized trials are direly needed in this population'. In another neurosurgical survey, approximately 80% chose restart timing intervals of 1 week or 1 month (vs never or longer) in central nervous system hemorrhage. The differing equipoise in sICrH and tICrH is illustrated in the prospective trial designs (see 'Prospective randomized trials' section for details). The one tICrH trial is focused on timing of restart without a non-anticoagulated control, while the several sICrH trials all have a control group.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^114JhYw6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A retrospective United States cohort study enrolled patients with AF who developed GI bleeding while receiving anticoagulation (n = 1329). Warfarin was restarted in 653 (49%) patients, after a median duration of 50 days (IQR 21–78). Restarting warfarin was associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56–0.81; P < .0001) and decreased risk of thromboembolism (adjusted HR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.93; p = 0.01), but not recurrent GI bleeding (adjusted HR 1.18; 95% CI, 0.94–1.10; p = 0.47). When the outcomes were stratified by duration of warfarin interruption, restarting warfarin after 7 days was not associated with increased risk of GI bleeding, but was associated with decreased risk of mortality and thromboembolism compared with resuming after 30 days of interruption. These data are in agreement with other studies. These findings were extended in a recent meta-analysis that included this study from the United States, and concluded that the resumption of warfarin following interruption because of GI bleeding is associated with a reduction in thromboembolic events and mortality without a statistically significant increase in recurrent GI bleeding.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1122fZyw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) requires caution due to high baseline risk; nonlobar ICH reinitiation "may be considered", observational data suggest resumption yields "50% to 70% lower" thrombosis and death without more recurrent bleeding versus discontinuation, timing in studies ranges "72 hours to 30 weeks", current guidelines "recommend avoiding anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks" without mechanical valves and using aspirin initially if indicated, and the authors "favor delaying" OAC for "at least 4 weeks" in patients without high thrombotic risk. ICH accounts for "approximately 20%" of spontaneous cases with "30-day mortality rates approaching 50%", recurrence risk is influenced by bleed mechanism, lobar location, microbleeds, and ongoing anticoagulation; DOAC safety after ICH switch "has not been evaluated". A randomized trial of 537 post‑ICH patients restarting aspirin showed a trend to less recurrent ICH (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) without reduction in ischemic events (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92), and a large retrospective study reported median OAC restart "approximately 1 month" after bleeding.

Figure 2 — management of nonmajor bleeding on OACs uses the decision, "Does the bleed require hospitalization, surgical/procedural intervention, or transfusion?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is not on VKA, do not administer reversal/hemostatic agent; if patient is on a VKA, consider ≤ 2.5 mg PO/IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no, actions are: consider continuing OAC (provided there is an appropriate indication); provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy, assess risks and benefits of stopping; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and determine if dosing of OAC is appropriate. The pathway then asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and, once patient is stable, advises to "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)".

### Predicting major bleeding during extended anticoagulation for unprovoked or weakly provoked venous thromboembolism [^116dhAAm]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common, potentially fatal, and disabling disease. Whether to continue anticoagulant therapy after completing an initial 3- to 6-month course of anticoagulant therapy for VTE is a common and often vexing clinical question. Ultimately, patients, clinicians, and policymakers must balance the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulant agents are discontinuedwith the long-term risk of major bleeding with continued anticoagulation.

Patients with VTE provoked by major transient risk factors (eg, major surgery) have a low risk of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant agentsand can safely stop anticoagulation after 3 to 6 months of initial therapy. Conversely, patients with a first episode of VTE that is unprovoked or associated with minor transient risk factors (ie, weakly provoked) have recurrent VTE risks of 10% at 1 year and 36% at 10 years without anticoagulationafter having received 3 to 6 months of initial therapy. As a result, such patients require suppression of the risk of recurrent VTE with indefinite duration of anticoagulation unless their risk of major bleeding is or becomes high. Because mortality rates associated with anticoagulant-related major bleeding are 2 to 3 times higher than those associated with recurrent VTE with discontinued anticoagulation, patients with an annual risk of major bleeding > 2.5% to 3% are not expected to gain a net clinical benefit from extended anticoagulation in the long term, even if their 10-year risk of recurrent VTE is as high as 36%. Unfortunately, there is no formal or systematic approach to assess who has a high risk of major bleeding; therefore, decision-making about stopping or continuing anticoagulation after 3 to 6 months in patients with unprovoked VTE remains a challenge.

### Antithrombotic medication management in GI bleeding… [^112MECSA]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Platelet transfusions appear to increase mortality in patients with GI bleeding who are taking antiplatelet agents.
- Patients should continue taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection in GI bleeding because stopping aspirin does not improve bleeding outcomes and may increase mortality.
- Prothrombin complex concentrates do not appear beneficial for GI bleeding related to direct oral anticoagulants but may be beneficial for patients taking warfarin. From the AFP Editors The major risk of taking antithrombotic medications, including antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents, is gastrointestinal bleeding. The optimal means of managing bleeding episodes is uncertain. The American College of Gastroenterology and Canadian Association of Gastroenterology conducted a systematic review to publish guidelines for managing GI bleeding for patients who are taking antithrombotic medications.

Antiplatelet Medications When patients who take antiplatelet medications have GI bleeding, platelet transfusions may be harmful. In a small cohort study, patients receiving platelet transfusions had an increased risk of death over patients who did not receive platelet transfusions, with no difference in further bleeding or thrombotic events. ASPIRIN When patients taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection present with GI bleeding, stopping aspirin is not helpful, and it may increase cardiovascular risk. Because aspirin causes permanent platelet inhibition that lasts for at least three days after stoppage, stopping aspirin is unlikely to reduce bleeding. In one small retrospective study, continued bleeding and mortality were similar whether aspirin was stopped or not. If aspirin is stopped for bleeding concerns, restarting aspirin shortly after surgery reduces cardiovascular and gastrointestinal mortality without increasing recurrent bleeding.

Because of the little to no benefit of aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention, stopping aspirin in these patients is recommended with any gastrointestinal bleeding. P2Y 12 INHIBITORS When patients have GI bleeding while taking P2Y. 12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel, evidence is less clear. From studies of endoscopy for patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, stopping the P2Y 12 inhibitor does not appear to reduce bleeding. Although up to 6% of patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy will have stent thrombosis if the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped for 10 days, the risk of stent thrombosis with a stoppage of up to four days appears minimal. Direct Oral Anticoagulants When patients have GI bleeding while taking direct oral anticoagulant medications, prothrombin complex concentrates may not be effective.

Evidence is limited to small studies with patients who had GI bleeding while taking dabigatran, where prothrombin complex concentrates did not improve outcomes over conservative care. RIVAROXABAN OR APIXABAN Andexanet alfa, a modified recombinant human factor Xa decoy protein, sequesters apixaban and rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa reduces the activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban by more than 90%, but the only clinical trial lacks a control group for clinical outcome comparison. It should be avoided until more data regarding its effectiveness are available. DABIGATRAN Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody to reverse the effects of dabigatran, does not appear to improve outcomes in patients with GI bleeding who are taking dabigatran. In a retrospective study, administering idarucizumab did not reduce mortality over conservative care.

Figure 2 — management of major bleeding on OACs (including direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs] and vitamin K antagonists [VKAs]) first asks, "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC and antiplatelet agent(s); if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide local therapy/ manual compression; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no (major but not critical/life threatening), actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. After initial measures, the pathway asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and if not, it states, "Suggest administering reversal/hemostatic agents* (see Figure 3)"; once the patient is stable, it advises, "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)". Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).

### Intracerebral haemorrhage on the acute stroke unit [^112Nv6ta]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial

A third of intracerebral haemorrhage occurs in patients already taking antithrombotic agents and it is not always obvious to the treating physician whether to re-start this medication once the patient has passed through the acute phase of ICH. There is understandable reservation due to the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage, but if patients are taking this medication for previous ischaemic stroke or ischaemic heart disease they may suffer harm if the medication is stopped. The RESTART trial was designed with this important clinical question in mind. It builds on observational studies that had suggested that if antithrombotic therapy is restarted, the risk of occlusive vascular events is lowered without an increase in recurrence of ICH. The patients involved were those on antithrombotic agents who survived the first 24 h after presenting with an ICH for whom the treating clinician was uncertain about restarting their anti-thrombotic medication.

Patients were included if they were taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy at presentation. 268 patients were randomized to start antiplatelet therapy after being diagnosed with ICH (aspirin, clopidogrel or dipyridamole, at a dose of the clinicians choosing) with 269 in the arm that avoided anti-platelet therapy. Primary outcome was risk of recurrent ICH. Secondary outcomes explored how each arm compared in relation to a composite of all major haemorrhagic events (including intracranial and extracranial haemorrhages) and a composite of all major occlusive events (including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction). Unexpectedly the group which restarted antiplatelet therapy had a lower incidence of recurrent ICH but this difference narrowly missed statistical significance (p = 0.060).

Comment. This trial suggests no increased risk of ICH recurrence in patients who take anti-platelet therapy after an ICH and that there may even be a lower risk of ICH. The RESTART collaboration state that the risk of ICH recurrence is outweighed by the benefit of a reduction in vascular occlusive events that comes with antiplatelet therapy; both cerebrovascular and cardiac disease. This study is an important step forward as it is a prospective randomized trial and its results are likely to be more reliable than the current evidence that is based on observational data. An unexpected observation which did not reach statistically significance, was a reduced risk of recurrent ICH with antiplatelet therapy. Possible explanations include the role of arterial thrombosis in ICH, or that some cases labeled as primary intracerebral bleeds are infarcts into which there has been acute secondary haemorrhage.

### Restarting anticoagulation and outcomes after major gastrointestinal bleeding in atrial fibrillation [^115aUF6o]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Data regarding the outcomes of restarting anticoagulation in patients who develop gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) while anticoagulated are sparse. We hypothesized that restarting anticoagulation in these patients is associated with better outcomes. This is a retrospective cohort study that enrolled subjects who developed GIB while on anticoagulation from 2005 to 2010. Atrial fibrillation was defined by history and electrocardiography on presentation. GIB was defined as a decrease in hemoglobin by 2 g, visible bleeding, or positive endoscopic evaluation. Time-to-event adjusted analyses were performed to find an association of restarting warfarin and recurrent GIB, arterial thromboembolism, and mortality. Stratified analysis by duration of interruption of warfarin was also performed. Overall, 1,329 patients (mean age 76 years, women 45%) developed major GIB. Warfarin was restarted in 653 cases (49.1%). Restarting warfarin was associated with decreased thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 1.84, p = 0.47) and reduced mortality (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.81, p < 0.0001) but not recurrent GIB (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10, p = 0.47). When the outcomes were stratified by duration of warfarin interruption, restarting warfarin after 7 days was not associated with increased risk of GIB but was associated with decreased risk of mortality and thromboembolism compared with resuming after 30 days of interruption. Decision to restart warfarin after an episode of major GIB is associated with improved survival and decreased thromboembolism without increased risk of GIB after 7 days of interruption.

### Major bleeding during secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients who have completed anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xAV1k]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal duration of anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. In these patients, the risk of recurrent events during the first year after anticoagulation is discontinued is between 5% and 10%. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation therapy and to consider prolonged treatment in patients with low or moderate risk of major bleeding events. To counsel patients, clinicians need accurate estimates of the risks of recurrent VTE and of major bleeding episodes with different therapeutic strategies to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks of long-term secondary prevention. The risk of major bleeding after completing anticoagulant therapy is unknown in this patient population. Therefore, the incremental risks of major bleeding with various treatment strategies over and above the risk with no anticoagulant therapy are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the rate of major bleeding episodes in high-risk patients participating in trials for the secondary prevention of recurrent VTE who received placebo or observation only (i.e. no anticoagulant therapy).

### Resumption of anticoagulant therapy after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VeRkV]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is permanently discontinued in up to 50% of patients following a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A previous meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, and a non-statistically significant increased risk of re-bleeding associated with resumption. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to determine the risks of recurrent GI bleeding, thromboembolism, and death in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not.

Materials and Methods

We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for new references from January 2014 to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving adults with OAC-related GI bleeding were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's ROBINS-I tool. Pooled relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

We identified 12 observational studies involving 3098 patients. There was an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48, I² = 0%, 11 studies), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68, I² = 59.8%, 9 studies) and death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70, I² = 71.8%, 8 studies) in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Eleven studies were judged to be at serious risk of bias due to confounding.

Conclusions

Resuming OAC after OAC-related GI bleeding appears to be associated with an increase in recurrent GI bleeding, but a reduction in thromboembolism and death. Further prospective data are needed to identify patients for whom the net clinical benefit favours OAC resumption and the optimal timing of resumption.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^115yg3fA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

As regards the resumption of anticoagulants following interruption, both European and US guidelines recommend restarting therapy in all patients who have an indication for long-term anticoagulation. According to a recent meta-analysis, the resumption of VKAs is associated with a significant reduction in thromboembolic events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.88) and mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88), and with a non-significant increase in rebleeding (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.66–0.88). The timing of anticoagulant resumption should be assessed on a patient by patient basis. In a large observational study, restarting warfarin therapy within 7 days from the index bleeding event was associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of rebleeding. Conversely, as compared with resuming warfarin beyond 30 days, resumption within between 7 and 30 days did not increase the risk of rebleeding, but did significantly decrease the risk of thromboembolism while improving survival. These data support the ESGE recommendations that resumption of anticoagulation between 7 and 15 days following the bleeding event is safe and effective in preventing thromboembolic complications for most patients. Earlier resumption, within the first week, may be indicated for patients at high thrombotic risk (e.g. chronic atrial fibrillation with previous embolic event, CHADS 2 score ≥ 3, mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, known severe hypercoagulable state). In these selected cases, bridging therapy with heparin may also be considered. No data are currently available to guide the timing of DOAC resumption following a bleeding event. It can be hypothesized that the principles adopted for VKAs (i.e. resumption of anticoagulation between 7 and 15 days following the bleeding event) could be extended to DOACs; however, caution is required because of their rapid onset of action.

Vitamin K antagonists versus direct oral anticoagulants

VKA such as warfarin had been the standard of care for decades until the DOACs were approved starting in 2010. With simple dosing, no routine monitoring, and less food and drug interactions, DOACs are rapidly replacing warfarin in non-valvular AF and venous thromboembolism treatment and prevention.DOACs are also associated with a lower ICrH risk. A possible mechanism involves factor VII. Warfarin inhibits factor VII synthesis (along with factors II, IX, X and proteins C and S) by blocking the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. DOACs target factors IIa and Xa, leaving factor VII intact. The brain is rich in tissue factor, an important protective mechanism in an environment where uncontrolled bleeding is fatal. The interaction of activated factor VII with tissue factor causing a thrombin burst is an important hemostatic mechanism as it is the initiation step in both the classic (extrinsic pathway) and cell-based models of coagulation. Lower ICrH risk was seen in all the clinical trials of VKA versus DOACs both in AF and VTE treatment populations. The patient populations that are an exception are those with mechanical valves and ventricular assist devices (VADs). Clinical trials of DOACs in valve patients failed.VKAs are still the standard of care in these patients. The prospective trials in restart and timing are primarily testing DOACs and excluding patients with mechanical valves and VADs. A retrospective analysis of mechanical valve patients with ICrH using a composite outcome found the balance between bleeding and thrombosis was best achieved in valve patients at 6.7 days to restart. In VAD patients, restarting at 10 days may strike the best balance.

When extrapolating warfarin data to DOACs, it important to remember that warfarin anticoagulation onset is delayed 5 days or more, and it is not standard to bridge with heparins except in VTE treatment. The restart and timing of restart literature contains primarily warfarin patients as retrospective databases used stretched back before the DOAC era.

### Restarting anticoagulant therapy after intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116k2dsn]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The safety and efficacy of restarting anticoagulation therapy after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations of anticoagulation resumption with the subsequent risk of ICH recurrence and thromboembolism.

Methods

We searched published medical literature to identify cohort studies involving adults with anticoagulation-associated ICH. Our predictor variable was resumption of anticoagulation. Outcome measures were thromboembolic events (stroke and myocardial infarction) and recurrence of ICH. After assessing study heterogeneity and publication bias, we performed a meta-analysis using random-effects models to assess the strength of association between anticoagulation resumption and our outcomes.

Results

Eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 5306 ICH patients. Almost all studies evaluated anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Reinitiation of anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic complications (pooled relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.45; Q = 5.12, P for heterogeneity = 0.28). There was no evidence of increased risk of recurrent ICH after reinstatement of anticoagulation therapy, although there was significant heterogeneity among included studies (pooled relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.77; Q = 24.68, P for heterogeneity < 0.001). No significant publication bias was detected in our analyses.

Conclusions

In observational studies, reinstitution of anticoagulation after ICH was associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic complications and a similar risk of ICH recurrence. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the true risk-benefit profile of anticoagulation resumption after ICH.

### What to do after the bleed: resuming anticoagulation after major bleeding [^115ueJyW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Resuming anticoagulation therapy after a potentially life-threatening bleeding complication evokes high anxiety levels among clinicians and patients trying to decide whether resuming oral anticoagulation to prevent devastating and potentially fatal thromboembolic events or discontinuing anticoagulation in hopes of reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding is best. The available evidence favors resumption of anticoagulation therapy for gastrointestinal tract bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage survivors, and it is reasonable to begin postbleeding decision making with resuming anticoagulation therapy as the default plan. After considering factors related to the index bleeding event, the underlying thromboembolic risk, and comorbid conditions, a decision to accept or modify the default plan can be made in collaboration with other care team members, the patient, and their caregivers. Although additional information is needed regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption, available evidence indicates that waiting ∼14 days may best balance the risk of recurrent bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality after gastrointestinal tract bleeding. When to resume anticoagulation after intracranial hemorrhage is less clear, but most studies indicate that resumption within the first month of discharge is associated with better outcomes.

### Geriatric trauma management [^111HQmqt]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — no randomized trial evidence exists to guide anticoagulation resumption in ICH patients. The European Stroke Initiative suggests starting with a review of the indication for anticoagulation and that oral antithrombotic therapy may be restarted 10–14 days postoperative depending on perceived thromboembolic and rebleeding risk; observational data noted median time to anticoagulation resumption was 31 days and that anticoagulation resumption was associated with fewer ischemic events.

### Safety and effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy in older people with atrial fibrillation during exposed and unexposed treatment periods [^112n2Atw]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to evaluate safety and effectiveness outcomes of anticoagulants in older people accounting for changes in treatment over time, including periods where anticoagulant therapy is discontinued or withheld and subsequently restarted. The risks of stroke and death were three times higher during unexposed periods, and the risk of myocardial infarction was almost double that of anticoagulant treated periods. The risk of major bleeds was not significantly reduced in the unexposed periods compared with time on anticoagulant treatment, but the risk of non-major bleeds was lower. There was no evidence that DOACs as a group were any different to warfarin in any of the studied outcomes except for a slight increase in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, when apixaban and rivaroxaban were analysed separately, rivaroxaban had a higher risk of bleeding (major, non-major and gastrointestinal) whereas apixaban showed a lower risk of the same bleed types than warfarin.

The increased risk of serious events when anticoagulation is withheld or discontinued in older patients is concerning, especially as stopping therapy appears to have little effect on reducing the risk of major bleeding, which is often a reason for these agents to be stopped. Our results are similar to those seen in the Global Anticoagulant Regsitry in the FIELD-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) registry after discontinuation of anticoagulation (stroke/systemic embolism: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.44; myocardial infarction: HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.13; death: HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.09), however it should be noted that their patients were much younger than our cohort with only a third being aged ≥ 75 years. Ischaemic stroke has been shown to double in older patients both in the UK and Denmark (HR 2.99, 95% CI 2.31 to 3.86, UK and HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.95, Denmark) who discontinued anticoagulation. Despite using a different UK data set and a nested case-control design, the authors found a very similar result thus strengthening the likelihood that this increase in stroke is a true risk of stopping anticoagulant therapy.

### The tightrope of resuming anticoagulation therapy after a bleed… [^115exvpW]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. In the absence of randomized clinical trial data to address complex treatment dilemmas when the therapeutic window of a therapy is narrow, the stakes are high, and the risk for harm is substantial, observational studies can help guide decision making. In the case of patients who have atrial fibrillation and an intracranial bleed while receiving anticoagulation therapy, whether one should resume that therapy is one such relatively common scenario. The risk for major bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy varies from as low as 0. 5% per year in low-morbidity populations to as high as 6% per year among patients with prior major bleeds. Given this incidence and the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation with an aging population, we can expect this dilemma to become even more common.

In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, the observational study by Nielsen et al1 suggests that resuming warfarin treatment results in a favorable trade-off. However, as with all observational studies, residual confounding may result. Specifically, healthier patients may have been more likely to resume anticoagulation therapy. Thus, as one engages in a discussion of the risks and benefits of such a high-stakes decision, we think these data are helpful until randomized clinical trials can address the unbiased effects of resuming warfarin therapy. The observed mortality difference in this study is provocative and fills in the evidence gap while supporting the need for a definitive clinical trial.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113ChN9x]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Managing nonmajor bleeds on oral anticoagulants (OAC) — for patients with a nonmajor bleed, the writing committee does not support routine reversal of the OAC, although it is often advisable to temporarily discontinue OAC therapy until the patient is clinically stable and hemostasis has been achieved. Whether to hold OAC should depend on individual patient characteristics, the nature of the bleed, and the intensity of anticoagulation with shared decision making, and guiding questions include whether baseline severe anemia requires transfusion of ≥ 1 units of RBCs. For any of these situations, the writing committee advises that the OAC be discontinued (at least temporarily) and consideration be given to whether concomitant antiplatelet agents could be discontinued safely; if OAC is stopped yet an indication remains, it is expected that patients should be able to restart when the concern for additional bleeding has resolved. If hospitalization, a procedure, or a transfusion is not required and hemostasis has been achieved, the writing committee supports continuing the OAC, and for those on concomitant antiplatelet agents the risks versus benefit of stopping should be weighed; temporary discontinuation of irreversible antiplatelet agents may not have a clinical effect for several days, with the 1 exception of ticagrelor, which has a half-life of 7 to 9 hours.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^112SJkjM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A retrospective United States cohort study enrolled patients with AF who developed GI bleeding while receiving anticoagulation (n = 1329). Warfarin was restarted in 653 (49%) patients, after a median duration of 50 days (IQR 21–78). Restarting warfarin was associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56–0.81; P < .0001) and decreased risk of thromboembolism (adjusted HR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.93; p = 0.01), but not recurrent GI bleeding (adjusted HR 1.18; 95% CI, 0.94–1.10; p = 0.47). When the outcomes were stratified by duration of warfarin interruption, restarting warfarin after 7 days was not associated with increased risk of GI bleeding, but was associated with decreased risk of mortality and thromboembolism compared with resuming after 30 days of interruption. These data are in agreement with other studies. These findings were extended in a recent meta-analysis that included this study from the United States, and concluded that the resumption of warfarin following interruption because of GI bleeding is associated with a reduction in thromboembolic events and mortality without a statistically significant increase in recurrent GI bleeding.

### Management of anticoagulation in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^111zJTPh]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding represents the most common adverse event associated with the use of oral anticoagulant therapy. Due to increasing prescription of anticoagulants worldwide, gastroenterologists are more and more called to deal with bleeding patients taking these medications. Their management is challenging because several issues have to be taken into account, such as the severity of bleeding, the intensity of anticoagulation, the patient's thrombotic risk and endoscopy findings. The recent introduction into the marketplace of new direct oral anticoagulants, for whom specific reversal agents are still lacking, further contributes to make the decision-making process even more demanding. Available evidence on this topic is limited and practice guidelines by gastroenterology societies only marginally address key issues for clinicians, including when and how to reverse coagulopathy, the optimal timing of endoscopy and when and how to resume anticoagulation thereafter. The present paper reviews the evidence in the literature and provides practical algorithms to support clinicians in the management of patients on anticoagulants who present with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Spontaneous rectus sheath hematomas: when to restart anticoagulation? [^116GkCCn]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the present study was to obtain data regarding the timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients with spontaneous rectus sheath hematomas (RSH).

Patients and Methods

The study is based on review of patients receiving anticoagulation medication who were diagnosed with a spontaneous RSH (traumatic and iatrogenic excluded) between 14 July 1997 and 17 March 2012.

Results

There were 156 patients (37% male; aged 73 ± 13 years) with an average body mass index of 29 ± 7 (procedure group 28 ± 6). Anticoagulants included coumadin (64%), intravenous heparin (21%), aspirin (8%), and others (7%). An intervention was needed in 29 (19%) of the patients (5% operative; 16% embolization). Sixty-two percent of patients had their anticoagulation restarted during their hospitalization, with a median re-initiation time of 4 days after RSH diagnosis (range 2–8 days). Timing of anticoagulant resumption did not differ regardless of the need for intervention (3 vs. 4 days). The complication rate was 19% (42% in the procedure group, none specific to the procedure), with the most common being acute renal failure (n = 8; 5%), death (n = 8; 5%), and thrombotic events (n = 5; 3%). After resumption of anticoagulation, two patients suffered enlargement of their RSH, both 2 days after resumption.

Conclusions

Intervention to control hemorrhage was unnecessary in the majority of patients with RSH. In those with resumption of anticoagulation, the majority of patients were safely restarted by day 4. Even though complications secondary to anticoagulation were few, thrombotic complications outnumbered bleeding complications, suggesting that anticoagulation was withheld for too long after RSH diagnosis.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^1173VW3j]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — restarting anticoagulation after intracranial bleeding lacks definitive timing guidance; the available evidence is insufficient to recommend the optimal timing to restart anticoagulation, and available guidelines suggest waiting 2 weeks or less for patients at high risk and 7–8 weeks for low-risk patients, but not more than 90 days after the bleeding event.

### Reintroduction of anti-thrombotic therapy after a gastrointestinal haemorrhage: if and when? [^113KYunV]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common clinical scenario and, in those using antithrombotic agents, the risk is significantly increased. Management of these patients, in terms of initial resuscitation is well established and numerous guidelines exist in this area. However, few studies have addressed the subsequent dilemma of if and when antithrombotic agents should be reintroduced. Consequently, practice is variable and not necessarily evidenced-based. Overall, for patients that are either anticoagulated or using antiplatelet drugs for secondary prophylaxis, there is a clear benefit to restarting these agents. However, there is limited data to guide when this should occur. For individuals at low risk of re-bleeding, current guidelines suggest single agent aspirin can be continued without interruption, assuming haemostatic control has been confirmed endoscopically. For those at higher bleeding risk, aspirin should be withheld, but reintroduced early (within 3 days of index endoscopy). However, randomised evidence is lacking, as are studies including more modern agents or combined anticoagulant/ antiplatelet regimens. As such, guidance statements are limited and management suggestions must be extrapolated from clinical trials, retrospective studies and data relating specifically to warfarin and aspirin. The intention of this review is to summarise what evidence is available and, where this is lacking, suggest pragmatic management options based on a risk-benefit assessment of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding.

### Recurrent bleeding and thrombotic events after resumption of oral anticoagulants following gastrointestinal bleeding: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on control of anticoagulation [^114gXZiT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal bleeding frequently complicates anticoagulant therapy causing treatment discontinuation. Data to guide the decision regarding whether and when to resume anticoagulation based on the risks of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding are scarce.

Objectives

We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of these events after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding and assess their relationship with timing of anticoagulation resumption.

Methods

Patients hospitalized because of gastrointestinal bleeding during oral anticoagulation for any indication were eligible. All patients were followed up to 2 years after the index bleeding for recurrent major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, venous or arterial thromboembolism, and mortality.

Results

We included 948 patients hospitalized for gastrointestinal bleeding occurring during treatment with vitamin K antagonists (n = 531) or direct oral anticoagulants (n = 417). In time-dependent analysis, anticoagulant treatment was associated with a higher risk of recurrent clinically relevant bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–2.22), but lower risk of thromboembolism (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21–0.55), and death (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.36–0.68). Previous bleeding, index major bleeding, and lower glomerular filtration rate were associated with a higher risk of recurrent bleeding. The incidence of recurrent bleeding increased after anticoagulation restart independently of timing of resumption.

Conclusions

Anticoagulant treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, but higher risk of recurrent bleeding. The latter seemed to be influenced by patient characteristics and less impacted by time of anticoagulation resumption.

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^117EJMk9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of recurrent bleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding. In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and recurrent bleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of recurrent GI bleeding.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111cBg6Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing interventional procedures (resumption of antithrombotic therapy), ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to restore or restart antithrombotic therapy during 12–24-hour period for intermediate-risk procedures, and low-risk procedures if the decision was made to hold based on risk factors, and 24–48 hours for major risk procedures, based on postoperative bleeding status. Consider resuming antithrombotic therapy 12 hours after interventional procedures if thromboembolic risk is high, with appropriate assessment and monitoring for clinically significant bleeding.

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^116CoZhb]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study question What are the risks of all cause mortality, thromboembolism, major bleeding, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding associated with restarting antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation?

Methods This Danish cohort study (1996–2012) included all patients with atrial fibrillation discharged from hospital after gastrointestinal bleeding while receiving antithrombotic treatment. Restarted treatment regimens were single or combined antithrombotic drugs with oral anticoagulation and antiplatelets. Follow-up started 90 days after discharge to avoid confounding from use of previously prescribed drugs on discharge. Risks of all cause mortality, thromboembolism, major bleeding, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding were estimated with competing risks models and time dependent multiple Cox regression models.

Study answer and limitations 4602 patients (mean age 78 years) were included. Within two years, 39.9% (95% confidence interval 38.4% to 41.3%, n = 1745) of the patients had died, 12.0% (11.0% to 13.0%, n = 526) had experienced thromboembolism, 17.7% (16.5% to 18.8%, n = 788) major bleeding, and 12.1% (11.1% to 13.1%, n = 546) recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. 27.1% (n = 924) of patients did not resume antithrombotic treatment. Compared with non-resumption of treatment, a reduced risk of all cause mortality was found in association with restart of oral anticoagulation (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.46), an antiplatelet agent (0.76, 0.68 to 0.86), and oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet agent (0.41, 0.32 to 0.52), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism was found in association with restart of oral anticoagulation (0.41, 0.31 to 0.54), an antiplatelet agent (0.76, 0.61 to 0.95), and oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet agent (0.54, 0.36 to 0.82). Restarting oral anticoagulation alone was the only regimen with an increased risk of major bleeding (1.37, 1.06 to 1.77) compared with non-resumption of treatment; however, the difference in risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was not significant between patients who restarted an antithrombotic treatment regimen and those who did not resume treatment.

What this study adds Among patients with atrial fibrillation who experience gastrointestinal bleeding while receiving antithrombotic treatment; subsequent restart of oral anticoagulation alone was associated with better outcomes for all cause mortality and thromboembolism compared with patients who did not resume treatment. This was despite an increased longitudinal associated risk of bleeding.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^1174w5Cg]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Adults with stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage often have a history of occlusive vascular disease, such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Consequently, at least a third of adults in high-income countries are taking oral antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) drugs at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage. Generally, antithrombotic drugs are immediately discontinued because of the risk of early haematoma growth. Discontinuation of these drugs is often permanent because of the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the risk of occlusive vascular events might be higher, so resumption of antithrombotic therapy might be beneficial overall.

Results of randomised trials have found a favourable balance of the benefits and risks of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease for a variety of conditions, but these trials excluded people with a history of major bleeding. Therefore, no published randomised trials are available on whether long-term antithrombotic therapy is safe or beneficial for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage overall, or in subgroups who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as people with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.

The use of antiplatelet therapy for about 2 days did not result in adverse effects for patients who had been enrolled in randomised trials of aspirin, without knowing their stroke was due to intracerebral haemorrhage. In the longer term (months to years), findings from a systematic review and meta-analysisof observational studies of patients with any type of intracranial haemorrhage (ie, intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural haemorrhage) showed lower risks of occlusive vascular events and no difference in haemorrhagic events associated with resumption compared with avoidance of antiplatelet therapy. Small, non-randomised observational studies of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage have reported similar associations with starting antiplatelet therapy compared with its avoidance. Because of the paucity of evidence, no guidelines with strong recommendations about long-term antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage are available, so variations in clinical practice occur. Therefore, randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether to use antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^1149hZjr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

4. Conclusions

In summary, the decision to restart OAC therapy in a patient receiving chronic OAC who has suffered from a major bleed is a highly individualized assessment. The risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding in that individual, while taking into account the morbidity and case-fatality of a thrombotic/bleed outcome, in addition to the optimal time frame of when to restart OAC. It is also dependent upon the original indication for OAC, and the type of major bleed from which the patient suffered. Many patients with OAC-associated ICHs can restart OAC at some point between 1 and 30 weeks, but careful risk stratification must be performed. Most patients with OAC-associated clinically stable GI hemorrhages can restart OAC at 1 week post index bleed. Currently, there are few data on how DOACs might change the risk–benefit analysis of when to restart therapy after a major bleed event, particularly in ICH. However, the available data are reassuring in that practitioners would expect approximately 50% fewer of these events vs VKA-treated patients, which has major implications from a public health perspective. A larger number of well-designed studies are needed in this area for both VKA and, especially, for DOAC-treated patient groups.

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^113dEthJ]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Risk of outcomes associated with antithrombotic treatment after baseline

The median duration of follow-up was 2.0 years (interquartile range 0.7 to 4.0 years). Table 3presents the time dependent adjusted hazard ratios of outcomes with antithrombotic treatment during follow-up in patients surviving the first 90 days after gastrointestinal bleeding. The reference was non-resumption of antithrombotic treatment.

Table 3
Main results presenting hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for restarting antithrombotic treatment and associated risk of outcome

Restart of single treatment with oral anticoagulation was associated with the lowest rate of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.39, 0.34 to 0.46) and thromboembolism (0.41, 0.31 to 0.54). Among the different treatment regimens that were restarted, the risk of major bleeding was significantly increased only in patients who restarted single treatment with oral anticoagulation (1.37, 1.06 to 1.77); however, the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding associated with any of the restarted groups was not significantly different from the reference group.

Additional analyses stratifying the study population at the inclusion event into three groups according to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score < 2, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 2 or 3, and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score > 3 indicated that a gradual increase of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score at the inclusion event was associated with a gradual decrease in the risk of all cause mortality among patients who restarted single treatment with oral anticoagulation. Moreover, a HAS-BLED score > 3 at the inclusion event showed an increased associated risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who restarted single treatment with oral anticoagulation (see supplementary table 3).

Based on the results from table 2, we performed a subgroup analysis stratifying patients into antithrombotic treatment at the inclusion event (single treatment with oral anticoagulation or an antiplatelet agent, or dual treatment with oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet agent). The results showed that independent of antithrombotic treatment before the gastrointestinal bleeding, restarting or modifying treatment to single treatment with oral anticoagulation was in general associated with the greatest effectiveness and a relative safety compared with other restarted treatment strategies and non-resumption of antithrombotic treatment (see supplementary table 4).

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^113YEN2U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Following resolution of the bleeding, the decision as to whether and when to restart anticoagulation can be challenging and is often complicated by the presence of extensive comorbidities, the degree of stroke risk, circumstances around the initial bleed and patient preference. Generally, it is reasonable to restart DOAC therapy 1–2 weeks after most mild to moderate gastrointestinal bleeding. The American Stroke Association recommends an interval of at least 4 weeks before restarting treatment after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, but no definitive guidelines have currently been agreed for situations such as the one discussed here. Given the potential for life-threatening complications with both under- and over-treatment, the decision is often difficult.

With the expanding role of DOAC therapy in modern practice, clinicians should be cognisant of the potential risks that accompany what is often a prolonged course of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Reversal agents are licensed and effective but are also costly and may be prothrombotic. Prompt recognition and early intervention can sometimes greatly improve outcomes. Supportive care only is indicated if a bleed is minor. Finally, whether and when it is appropriate to restart anticoagulation is a challenging decision with the potential for profound consequences. Further research is needed in order to construct substantive guidelines.

Learning points

The incidence of adverse effects is lower with DOAC therapy than with vitamin K antagonists. However, the increased risk of haemorrhage — both provoked and spontaneous — is still present.
While reversal agents are licensed for DOAC therapy, a supportive approach may be appropriate.
The decision as to whether anticoagulation is appropriate should be reviewed on a regular basis as the patient's clinical condition changes.

### STudy of antithrombotic treatment after intraCerebral haemorrhage: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^112JYf4h]. European Stroke Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Antithrombotic treatment is well-established for patients without prior intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH): antiplatelet drugs for the prevention of serious vascular events in patients with vascular disease, and anticoagulant drugs to prevent systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, among other indications. However, antithrombotic drugs increase the risk of bleeding and ICH is the most severe and feared complication. Forty percent of patients suffering from ICH die within the first month and more than half the survivors become dependent on help from others.

The annual risk of ICH recurrence is estimated to be 1.8–7.4%, but in the long term, these patients are at even higher risk of ischaemic events like myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. A substantial proportion of patients presenting with ICH are on antithrombotic treatment: a quarter use anticoagulant drugs, and more than one-third use antiplatelet drugs. Overall, 40–50% use, or have an indication for, antithrombotic treatment. After the acute phase of the ICH, the physician must decide whether to resume the antithrombotic drug or not. However, preventing a possibly devastating ischaemic event with a drug that might cause a new ICH creates a clinical dilemma because the safety of antithrombotic drugs is unknown in patients with prior ICH. Guidelines do not make clear recommendations about this, – both policies occur in standard clinical practice, – and clinical equipoise is demonstrated in surveys in the UK and Scandinavia.

Until recently, no randomised controlled trials have assessed effects of long-term antithrombotic treatment after ICH. Observational studies have investigated the safety of antiplatelet,– and anticoagulant,– treatment after different types of intracranial haemorrhage including ICH. Overall, in these studies, antithrombotic drugs were not associated with an increased risk of recurrent ICH. However, associations with the risk of ischaemic events varied, most of the studies were small, and they were prone to selection bias and confounding by indication.

Recently, the RESTART randomised controlled trial of 537 patients investigated effects of antiplatelet treatment after ICH. During a median follow-up period of two years, RESTART did not show an increase in the rate of recurrent ICH from antiplatelet drugs, but on the contrary a non-significant reduction in the risk of recurrent ICH (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060). The RESTART results are reassuring for antiplatelet treatment but need to be confirmed by other randomised trials.

- Composite of Thrombotic events, defined as DVT, PE, MI, Ischemic Strokes, and systemic emboli, along with bleeding events defined as non-CNS major bleeds, worsening index tICrH, or new intracranial hemorrhage.

To identify the optimal interval to restart oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage that will minimize thrombotic events and major bleeding by performing a response adaptive randomized PROBE clinical trial of restarting in anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage patients, comparing restart at 1 week to restart at 2 weeks or at 4 weeks, with a primary composite outcome of major thrombotic events and bleeding. Primary Outcome: 60-day composite of thromboembolic events, defined as DVT, pulmonary emboli, myocardial infarctions, ischemic strokes and systemic emboli, and bleeding events defined as non-CNS major bleeding events and worsening index tICrH or new intracranial hemorrhage.

Secondary objectives of this trial include:

- To use the Trauma Quality Improvement Program of the American College of Surgeons
- Committee on Trauma, a well-established and highly respected trauma center oversight mechanism, to translate findings of the trial into practice in a closed loop.
- To establish a relationship between time of restarting and overall secondary events, i.e. a dose response, that favors early restarting clinical trial of restarting in anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage patients, comparing restart at 1 week to restart at 2 weeks or at 4 weeks, with a primary composite outcome of major thrombotic events and bleeding. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that restarting an oral anticoagulant at one week after anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, compared to delayed restarting, reduces a composite outcome of major thrombotic events and major bleeding.

### Who should get long-term anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism and with what? [^111aDq42]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

After an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians and patients face an important question: "Do we stop anticoagulants or continue them indefinitely?" The decision is easy in some scenarios (eg, stop in VTE provoked by major surgery). In most scenarios, which are faced on a day-to-day basis in routine practice, it is a challenging decision because of uncertainty in estimates in the long-term risks (principally major bleeding) and benefits (reducing recurrent VTE) and the tight trade-offs between them. Once the decision is made to continue, the next question to tackle is "Which anticoagulant?" Here again, it is a difficult decision because of the uncertainty with regard to estimates of efficacy and the safety of anticoagulant options and the tight trade-offs between choices. We conclude with the approach that we take in our clinical practice.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114oVWyE]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICrH) is a devastating injury with high morbidity and mortality. For survivors, treating clinicians face the dilemma of restarting oral anticoagulation with scarce evidence to guide them. Thromboembolic risk is high from the bleeding event, patients' high baseline risks, that is, the pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, and the risk of immobility after the bleeding episode. This must be balanced with potentially devastating hematoma expansion or new hemorrhagic lesions. Retrospective evidence and expert opinion support restarting oral anticoagulants in most patients with tICrH, but timing is uncertain. Researchers have failed to make clear distinctions between tICrH and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICrH), which have differing natural histories. While both appear to benefit from restarting, sICrH has a higher rebleeding risk and similar or lower thrombotic risk. Clinical equipoise on restarting is also divergent. In sICrH, equipoise is centered on whether to restart. In tICrH, it is centered on when. Several prospective randomized clinical trials are ongoing or about to start to examine the risk–benefit of restarting. Most of them are restricted to patients with sICrH, with antiplatelet control groups. Most are also restricted to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they are associated with a lower overall risk of ICrH. There is some overlap with tICrH via subdural hematoma, and one trial is specific to restart timing with DOACs in only traumatic cases. This is a narrative review of the current evidence for restarting anticoagulation and restart timing after tICrH along with a summary of the ongoing and planned clinical trials.

### Restart TICrH: an adaptive randomized trial of time intervals to restart direct oral anticoagulants after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^114AwjXS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis and death in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) but also increase bleeding risk. The benefit/risk ratio favors anticoagulation in most of these patients. However, some will have a bleeding complication, such as the common trip-and-fall brain injury in elderly patients that results in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Clinicians must then make the difficult decision about when to restart the anticoagulant. Restarting too early risks making the bleeding worse. Restarting too late risks thrombotic events such as ischemic stroke and VTE, the indications for anticoagulation in the first place. There are more data on restarting patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, which is very different than traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage increases the risk of rebleeding because intrinsic vascular changes are widespread and irreversible. In contrast, traumatic cases are caused by a blow to the head, usually an isolated event portending less future risk. Clinicians generally agree that anticoagulation should be restarted but disagree about when. This uncertainty leads to long restart delays causing a large, potentially preventable burden of strokes and VTE, which has been unaddressed because of the absence of high quality evidence. Restart Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (the "r" distinguished intracranial from intracerebral) (TICrH) is a prospective randomized open label blinded end-point response-adaptive clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of delays to restarting direct oral anticoagulation (1, 2, or 4 weeks) on the composite of thrombotic events and bleeding in patients presenting after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cEUkX]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Our results provide clinicians, patients, and policymakers with rigorous benchmarks as well as a management framework in which to consider the long term risks and consequences of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped. When weighed against current best estimates for risks and consequences of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued, our results could be used to decide whether to consider indefinite anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE. For example, in a typical patient with a first episode of unprovoked VTE with a risk for recurrent VTE of 36% at 10 years, combined with a case fatality rate for recurrent VTE of 4% as determined by our analysis, the risk of death from a first recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment would be about 1.44% by 10 years. Indeed, our pooled results showed a cumulative risk of recurrent fatal VTE of 1.5% at 10 years after discontinuation of treatment. For the same patient, the annual risk for major bleeding if treatment is continued is estimated at 1.2%, translating to a 10 year risk for major bleeding of 12%. When combined with the case fatality rate for major bleeding of 11%, the risk of death from major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued would be about 1.32% at 10 years. Hence, over a 10 year horizon, patients with a first unprovoked VTE might be expected to derive a small net long term mortality benefit from continuing anticoagulation, consistent with current guidelines that suggest considering indefinite anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who are not at high risk for bleeding. Nevertheless, our estimation of the net mortality benefit is limited owing to the uncertainty in estimates of the long term risk of major bleeding and case fatality rate of major bleeding during extended anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE event, which should be the focus of future research.

GASTROINTESTINAL HEMORRHAGE AND RE-INITIATION OF OACS

Gastrointestinal bleeding also has a diverse etiology (eg, hemorrhagic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis), but has generally been studied as a single cohort. Again, etiology plays a role in recurrence risk, but it is difficult to parse out. Acute GI bleeds related to both VKAand DOACtherapy are more common in the upper GI tract. Data from an open cohort study (upper GI bleed n = 21,641) gave an age-standardized incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) for upper GI tract bleeding of 5.8 in those prescribed warfarin and 2.7 in those prescribed DOACs. A meta-analysis of data from 11 phase 3 randomized controlled trials reported no significant difference in the overall incidence of major GI bleeding between DOACs and VKAs (relative risk 0.94; p = 0.62). There is evidence, some of it prospective, that restarting OAC therapy after GI hemorrhage is beneficial.

A prospective observational study in the United States identified 197 patients who developed GI bleeding while receiving systemic anticoagulation (145/197 [74%] received warfarin), of whom 76 (39%) discontinued anticoagulation upon hospital discharge (ie, interruption of anticoagulation for ≥ 72 hours after discharge). Restarting OAC therapy at hospital discharge was associated with a lower risk of major thrombotic episodes within 90 days (HR 0.121; 95% CI, 0.006–0.812; p = 0.03), and no significant difference in mortality was observed (at 90 days, HR 0.632; 95% CI, 0.216–1.89; p = 0.40). Furthermore, restarting OAC was not significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding at 90 days (HR 2.17; 95% CI, 0.861–6.67; p = 0.10).

### Economic evaluation of strategies for restarting anticoagulation therapy after a first event of unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^115mdKhU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Correct duration of treatment after a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is unknown. We assessed when restarting anticoagulation was worthwhile based on patient risk of recurrent VTE. When the risk over a one-year period is 17.5%, restarting is cost-effective. However, sensitivity analyses indicate large uncertainty in the estimates.

Summary

Background Following at least 3 months of anticoagulation therapy after a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), there is uncertainty about the duration of therapy. Further anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of having a potentially fatal recurrent VTE but at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding, which can also be fatal. Objective An economic evaluation sought to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule for restarting anticoagulation therapy vs. no extension of therapy in patients based on their risk of a further unprovoked VTE. Methods A Markov patient-level simulation model was developed, which adopted a lifetime time horizon with monthly time cycles and was from a UK National Health Service (NHS)/Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. Results Base-case model results suggest that treating patients with a predicted 1 year VTE risk of 17.5% or higher may be cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay up to £20 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the model was highly sensitive to overall parameter uncertainty and caution is warranted in selecting the optimal decision rule on cost-effectiveness grounds. Univariate sensitivity analyses indicate variables such as anticoagulation therapy disutility and mortality risks were very influential in driving model results. Conclusion This represents the first economic model to consider the use of a decision rule for restarting therapy for unprovoked VTE patients. Better data are required to predict long-term bleeding risks during therapy in this patient group.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1127gUxn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

ACC 2020 bleeding pathway — timing of anticoagulation reinitiation: "In general, all such decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary care team". Conditions with high thrombotic risk favor early reinitiation "once hemostasis is achieved and the patient is clinically stable", and "OAC may be reinitiated with close monitoring in patients with high thrombotic risk; for patients with moderate or high rebleeding risk, individualized strategies are appropriate". As an example of early reinitiation, "parenteral anticoagulants can often be started with close monitoring within 1 to 3 days in most patients". For high rebleeding risk when thrombotic risk is unacceptably high and therapeutic anticoagulation is necessary, "it is suggested that unfractionated heparin be administered by intravenous infusion owing to its short half-life and the availability of a reversal agent (protamine sulfate) that can rapidly stop and/or reverse anticoagulation in the event of rebleeding".

General clinical assumptions — acute bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: The ECDP considers acute bleeding in patients being treated with either DOACs or VKAs and all indications for anticoagulation were considered, including AF, VTE treatment and prevention, prosthetic cardiac valves, history of prior thromboembolism, intracardiac thrombus, and the presence of a mechanical circulatory support device. In the setting of bleeding with hemodynamic compromise, standard resuscitative measures should always be performed promptly. The recommendations for restarting and withholding anticoagulant therapy refer to both DOACs and VKAs, and the algorithms assume that the provider will seek input from the appropriate specialists when indicated and involve the patient and/or family in shared decision making when possible.

Delaying restart of anticoagulation — algorithm for post-bleed management in patients on oral anticoagulants details sequential decision points and actions. If the answer to "Is the patient willing to restart anticoagulation at this time?" is no, proceed to "Initiate clinician/patient discussion (see Table 7)". If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^115MUxbk]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Mortality was high among patients with atrial fibrillation who were discharged from hospital after a gastrointestinal bleeding event while taking antithrombotics. More than a quarter did not resume treatment. However, among patients surviving the first 90 days after gastrointestinal bleeding, restarting single treatment with oral anticoagulation was associated with the lowest risk of all cause mortality and thromboembolism, and a relative safe use regarding the risk of recurrent bleeding, compared with non-resumption of antithrombotic treatment or restarting other antithrombotic treatment regimens.

### What we have learned about direct oral anticoagulant reversal [^116BxmED]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Bleeding is the main complication of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, with major bleeds occurring in about 2% to 4% of OAC-treated patients per year. Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) reduce the risk of major, fatal, and intracranial hemorrhage, major DOAC-related bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with case-fatality rates of 8% to 15% reported. Specific reversal agents for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet) correct laboratory indices of anticoagulant effect. Clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients receiving these agents for DOAC-associated major bleeds experience clinical hemostasis. However, uncertainty remains regarding the incremental benefit of these agents and prothrombin complex concentrates over supportive measures alone, based on cohort studies that lacked control groups. Similar methodologic limitations preclude firm conclusions regarding the harms associated with use of these agents. Importantly, patients with DOAC-related major bleeding have substantial short-term risks of thrombosis and mortality, emphasizing the need for individualized patient assessment and protocolized bleed management strategies that include assessment of candidacy for safe resumption of OACs. With expanding indications and increasing prevalence of DOAC-eligible patients, bleeding complications and their management represent an ever-greater major health problem.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to long-term medical therapy, resumption of antithrombotics, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider starting anticoagulation ≈ 7–8 weeks after ICH after weighing specific patient characteristics to optimize the balance of risks and benefits in patients with AF, if the decision is made to restart anticoagulation.

Acute GI haemorrhage on antiplatelets and anticoagulants

Antiplatelets

We suggest that permanent discontinuation of aspirin for primary prophylaxis should be considered (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).

We suggest that aspirin for secondary prevention should not be routinely stopped. If it is stopped, it should be recommenced as soon as haemostasis is achieved, or there is no further evidence of bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

We recommend that DAPT is continued if possible in patients with coronary stents in situ and management should be in liaison with a consultant interventional cardiologist (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). In the case of major haemorrhage we recommend continuing aspirin if the P2Y12 receptor antagonist is interrupted (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy should be re-instated within 5 days, if still indicated (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Antiplatelets confer an increased risk of spontaneous haemorrhage, but also present an increased risk to the patient when this occurs. In the case of life-threatening haemorrhage, this is of urgent concern, but withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy confers a risk of thrombosis. A meta-analysis of studies of patients on aspirin for secondary prophylaxis found that discontinuation of aspirin was associated with a threefold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events, increasing to an OR of 89 for major cardiac events in patients with coronary stents. If GI haemorrhage occurs in a patient with a recently placed coronary stent on DAPT, then life-threatening thrombosis could occur if therapy is interrupted. The imperative, after adequate resuscitation, is to achieve haemostasis within the GI tract and urgent facilities should be available to provide this. Liaison with a consultant interventional cardiologist should occur in the emergency setting. If it is deemed necessary to temporarily discontinue antiplatelet therapy, this should be limited to the P2Y12 receptor antagonist, and aspirin continued. The timing of restarting antithrombotic therapy after acute GI haemorrhage will be determined by the risk of re-bleeding and the risk of acute thrombosis without antithrombotic therapy.P2Y12 receptor antagonists in patients with coronary stents should be restarted within a maximum of 5 days due to the high risk of stent thrombosis after this time. This timeframe represents an optimal balance between haemorrhage and thrombosis, though it has not been tested prospectively.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^116JrQHw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium, and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists), and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment: the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Anticoagulation use and clinical outcomes after major bleeding on dabigatran or warfarin in atrial fibrillation [^117MSdpz]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Little is known about the clinical outcomes associated with posthemorrhage anticoagulation resumption for atrial fibrillation. This study had 2 objectives: first, to evaluate anticoagulation use after a first major bleed on warfarin or dabigatran and, second, to compare effectiveness and safety outcomes between patients discontinuing anticoagulation after a major bleed and patients restarting warfarin or dabigatran.

Methods

Using 2010 to 2012 Medicare Part D data, we identified atrial fibrillation patients who experienced a major bleeding event while using warfarin (n = 1135) or dabigatran (n = 404) and categorized them by their posthemorrhage use of anticoagulation. We followed them until an ischemic stroke, recurrent hemorrhage, or death through December 31, 2012. We constructed logistic regression models to evaluate factors affecting anticoagulation resumption and Cox proportional hazard models to compare the combined risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality and the risk of recurrent bleeding between treatment groups.

Results

Resumption of anticoagulation with warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.97) or dabigatran (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44–0.99) was associated with lower combined risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality than anticoagulation discontinuation. The incidence of recurrent major bleeding was higher for patients prescribed warfarin after the event than for those prescribed dabigatran (HR 2.31; 95% CI 1.19–4.76) or whose anticoagulation ceased (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10–2.22), but did not differ between patients restarting dabigatran and those discontinuing anticoagulation (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.32–1.33).

Conclusions

Dabigatran was associated with a superior benefit/risk ratio than warfarin and anticoagulation discontinuation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation patients who have survived a major bleed.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^113pugHg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evaluation of an individual's risk factors for stroke, bleeding, and VTE recurrence is essential to understanding the risks and benefits of OAC therapy for that individual, and several risk-stratification tools are available (Table 2,– Table 3,– and Table 4 –). The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoreto assess stroke risk and the HAS-BLED scoreto assess bleeding risk are the most commonly used tools, as recommended by the current guidelines. The HAS-BLED score was used to identify modifiable risk factors for bleeding. It should be noted that these schemes were developed in populations with AF and did not include patients with VTE. The same is true of the HEMORR 2 HAGES score for bleeding risk, whereas the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index (OBRI) validation did include patients with VTE. Validated scores for predicting VTE recurrence include HERDOO2, the Vienna model, and DASH. Unfortunately, bleeding scores (OBRI, HEMORR 2 HAGES, HAS-BLED, and ATRIA) have shown poor discriminatory ability to predict major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in subsequent external validation studies.

A broad clinical assessment must be performed following an OAC-related major hemorrhage, including identification of the underlying reason for which the patient originally received anticoagulation therapy and their risk of stroke or VTE and bleeding. Factors that would favor restarting OAC therapy include the presence of deep ICH, a mechanical heart valve, secondary prevention, or high risk of stroke or VTE. A corrected cause of bleeding (eg, a clipped aneurysm or a repaired aortoenteric fistula) would also facilitate OAC restart. Factors that would confer an unfavorable benefit–risk profile for restarting OAC therapy include lobar ICH, multiple microbleeds on gradient-recalled-echo-magnetic resonance imaging (correlating with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and an increased risk of ICH recurrence), and a low risk of stroke or VTE.

### Management of oral anticoagulation therapy after gastrointestinal bleeding: whether to, when to, and how to restart an anticoagulation therapy [^1132E9aM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current clinical evidence for management of oral anticoagulation therapy after gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with an emphasis on whether to, when to, and how to resume an anticoagulation therapy.

Data Sources

Relevant articles from MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were identified from 1946 through May 20, 2017, using the keywords: gastrointestinal hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding and antithrombotic therapy or anticoagulation therapy or warfarin or dabigatran or rivaroxaban or apixaban or edoxaban.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies assessing management of oral anticoagulation therapy after GIB were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A total of 9 studies were identified. Four retrospective cohort studies showed that resuming anticoagulation therapy was associated with significantly lower rate of thromboembolism (TE) in the general population. Meta-analyses and prospective cohort studies also supported this finding. Two retrospective cohort studies indicated an increase in GIB when anticoagulation reinitiation occurred in less than 7 days without a decrease in TE. Resuming therapy between 7 and 15 days did not demonstrate a significant increase in GIB or TE. A large retrospective study showed that apixaban was associated with the significantly lowest risk of GIB compared with both rivaroxaban and dabigatran.

Conclusion

Anticoagulation therapy resumption is recommended, with resumption being considered between 7 and 14 days following GIB regardless of the therapy chosen. Data for warfarin management after GIB should be applied with caution to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because of the quicker onset and experimental nature of reversal agents. Apixaban may be a preferred option when restarting a DOAC therapy.

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^112UdKpD]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study Question

What are the risks of all cause mortality, thromboembolism, major bleeding, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding associated with restarting antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation?

Methods

This Danish cohort study (1996–2012) included all patients with atrial fibrillation discharged from hospital after gastrointestinal bleeding while receiving antithrombotic treatment. Restarted treatment regimens were single or combined antithrombotic drugs with oral anticoagulation and antiplatelets. Follow-up started 90 days after discharge to avoid confounding from use of previously prescribed drugs on discharge. Risks of all cause mortality, thromboembolism, major bleeding, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding were estimated with competing risks models and time dependent multiple Cox regression models.

Study Answer and Limitations

4602 patients (mean age 78 years) were included. Within two years, 39.9% (95% confidence interval 38.4% to 41.3%, n = 1745) of the patients had died, 12.0% (11.0% to 13.0%, n = 526) had experienced thromboembolism, 17.7% (16.5% to 18.8%, n = 788) major bleeding, and 12.1% (11.1% to 13.1%, n = 546) recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. 27.1% (n = 924) of patients did not resume antithrombotic treatment. Compared with non-resumption of treatment, a reduced risk of all cause mortality was found in association with restart of oral anticoagulation (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.46), an antiplatelet agent (0.76, 0.68 to 0.86), and oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet agent (0.41, 0.32 to 0.52), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism was found in association with restart of oral anticoagulation (0.41, 0.31 to 0.54), an antiplatelet agent (0.76, 0.61 to 0.95), and oral anticoagulation plus an antiplatelet agent (0.54, 0.36 to 0.82). Restarting oral anticoagulation alone was the only regimen with an increased risk of major bleeding (1.37, 1.06 to 1.77) compared with non-resumption of treatment; however, the difference in risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was not significant between patients who restarted an antithrombotic treatment regimen and those who did not resume treatment.

What This Study Adds

Among patients with atrial fibrillation who experience gastrointestinal bleeding while receiving antithrombotic treatment; subsequent restart of oral anticoagulation alone was associated with better outcomes for all cause mortality and thromboembolism compared with patients who did not resume treatment. This was despite an increased longitudinal associated risk of bleeding.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114EPit2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

US trauma centers care for > 18 000 anticoagulated traumatic intracranial hemorrhages (tICrHs) per year, although this likely understates the disease scope as many tICrH cases are cared for in non-trauma centers. Failure to restart anticoagulation in tICrH survivors contributes to an enormous thromboembolic burden in strokes, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and other events. The risk–benefit in the naïve state usually favors anticoagulation by an order of magnitude, but this relationship shifts once ICrH has occurred, when clinicians must cease or reverse anticoagulation to stabilize the patient. At some time point, most patients with tICrH return to a state which again favors anticoagulation. A survey of neurosurgeons found nearly half encounter the tICrH restart question once a week or more. There is already broad consensus that most patients with tICrH should be restarted. The unanswered question is when. In the absence of randomized trials and a definitive time target, restart practice in tICrH is highly variable — from 3 days to several months to never. Cumulative thromboembolic risk rises with time and is a combination of baseline risk, the bleeding episode itself, any reversal agents used and immobility afterwards. Rebleeding risk is high early when clots are forming and stabilizing and falls with increasing time (see figure 1), eventually to a baseline, which may be informed/adjusted by the type of index bleeding episode for any additional rebleeding risk. Importantly, ICrH is at least two diseases with different natural histories. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), such as lobar ICH with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, may heighten the patient's risk for recurrent bleeding and alter the baseline risk–benefit for anticoagulation. In contradistinction, after tICrH, the index hemorrhage is less likely to affect the patient's baseline bleeding risk. Several trials are in planning or actively enrolling to address anticoagulation restart and restart timing questions. Numerous retrospective cohorts have found benefit with minimal increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage in patients with restarted tICrH. This narrative review summarizes the retrospective evidence for restart and timing of restart of oral anticoagulants after tICrH, the guidelines and the prospective trials on this topic.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^116PfABU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many decades, OAC therapy consisted of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), typically warfarin in the United States, although other VKAs (eg, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol) are used in other geographical areas. VKAs act by blocking vitamin K epoxide reductase to inhibit the activation of clotting factors (F) II, VII, IX, and X, and natural anticoagulant proteins C and S. However, in recent years, small-molecule DOACs have become available, the first of which was the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, which gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010 for the risk reduction of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF). This was quickly followed by the arrival of drugs that directly inhibit FXa (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban), which is 1 step proximal to the action of direct FIIa inhibitors such as dabigatran in the clotting cascade. Data from phase 3 clinical trials in patients with NVAF demonstrated that these 4 DOACs were either noninferior or superior to warfarin in terms of efficacy (ie, reducing the rates of stroke and systemic embolism), and showed equivalence or improved safety (ie, major hemorrhage and clinically relevant nonmajor hemorrhage) vs warfarin. DOACs were associated with an approximately 30%–70% reduction in the rates of ICH vs warfarin, although they were associated with generally higher rates of GI bleeding (not further defined; annualized rate ranged from approximately 0.8% to 3.2% for DOACs [depending on the agent and dose] vs approximately 1.0% to 2.2% for warfarin). DOACs are also approved for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which they were noninferior to conventional therapy in terms of efficacy outcomes, and showed equivalence or improvement in the overall safety profile.

To date, comparatively few data have been published on restarting OAC therapy after a major hemorrhage and the data that do exist are almost exclusively from patients receiving VKAs, with very few data concerning DOACs. Furthermore, some expert opinion recommends approaching the re-initiation of DOACs similarly to restart scenarios with warfarin. This is reflected in the discussion below. This review aims to summarize the key evidence and provide guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be restarted on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage.
