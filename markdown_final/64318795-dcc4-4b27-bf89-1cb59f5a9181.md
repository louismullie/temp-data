## Question

Marginal placenta abruption

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about marginal placental abruption. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and classification, including how "marginal" differs from other abruption phenotypes. Then, I should review pathophysiology, especially the ischemic placental disease framework and acute triggers. Next, I will examine epidemiology and risk factors, followed by clinical presentation patterns unique to marginal abruption. After that, I should verify diagnostic strategies, including the limits of ultrasound and when to consider MRI or CT in trauma. I will then evaluate lab markers and coagulopathy risk, outline management by gestational age and severity with marginal-specific nuances, and detail maternal and neonatal outcomes, including recurrence risk. Finally, I will consider prevention, counseling, and special situations, while double-checking areas where the evidence base is weak or conflicting, and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification. Marginal (peripheral) placental abruption refers to separation that begins at the placental edge rather than centrally, which often leads to revealed external bleeding because blood can escape through the membranes and cervix, whereas central abruptions are more likely to be concealed with trapped retroplacental blood and greater fetal compromise, although overlap occurs clinically [^115hVHE2]. I should confirm severity frameworks as well; traditional grading systems rely on maternal and fetal complications, and contemporary proposals include neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery and growth restriction in defining severe abruption, which underscores that severity is not solely a maternal-fetal hemodynamic snapshot but also an outcome construct [^113gwZxS]. Hold on, I need to check the notion that "less than one-third placental surface" equals "mild abruption" — that criterion appears in a single observational source and should not be generalized without caution; still, it helps illustrate that small, marginal separations can present with minimal pain and normal fetal heart tones in some contexts [^112vWGdY] [^115hVHE2] [^113gwZxS]. I should also note an atypical, chronic or recurrent light-bleeding phenotype that can reflect marginal or submembranous bleeding over time, complicating prenatal detection and sometimes only confirmed on postpartum pathology or data review [^116AW1gW].

> I need to verify the pathophysiology next. Placental abruption reflects a convergence of chronic uteroplacental malperfusion and acute events, linking it within the broader construct of ischemic placental disease alongside preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, with shared features of inadequate spiral artery remodeling, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and decidual vasculopathy, superimposed by acute shear forces or decidual hemorrhage that trigger separation and thrombin-mediated uterine activity [^112oMLMk] [^116WqiHg] [^111Jas3a]. Let me think about marginal lesions specifically: peripheral attachment may represent a region of comparatively weaker adherence, facilitating revealed bleeding and sometimes a smoldering, chronic course rather than acute catastrophic compromise, though this is a tendency, not an absolute rule and should not lull us into underestimating risk in any bleeding abruption presentation [^115hVHE2] [^116AW1gW] [^114Vkjri]. I should confirm that both acute inflammatory processes and chronic vascular disease contribute differentially by gestational age, with more acute inflammation at preterm and chronic vasculopathy across gestation, shaping heterogeneous pathways to abruption [^117K7aLm] [^114Vkjri].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. The incidence of abruption is approximately 0.6–1.2% of pregnancies, and may be increasing, with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality burden worldwide, especially in resource-limited settings where hemorrhage care is constrained [^112j9X3f] [^114Vkjri] [^1114iZaa]. Prior abruption is the strongest risk factor, with recurrence risks on the order of 5–6% and very high adjusted odds relative to those without prior history, with higher recurrence when the index abruption occurred at term compared with preterm, which I should be sure to emphasize in counseling [^1114iZaa] [^115wMG1R]. I should double-check the major contributors: chronic and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, smoking, cocaine, trauma, premature rupture of membranes and pressure shifts, polyhydramnios, multifetal gestation, advanced maternal age, and thrombophilias including Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A, all demonstrate associations, though the strength and independence vary by study and population [^114Vkjri] [^1168SVVi] [^1153kkc9] [^112cwr9Y]. Race-specific analyses repeatedly show higher risk among Black mothers, especially at earlier gestational ages, though contributions to preterm birth pathways are heterogeneous and not solely explained by abruption frequencies, an important nuance when interpreting disparities [^1166u6Aq] [^112Z7mLJ] [^1132EZ1u]. Assisted reproduction has been linked to abruption risk, likely via placental developmental pathways, and serum biomarkers such as elevated second-trimester MSAFP show association but inadequate predictive performance for screening, so I should not overstate their clinical utility in isolation [^1119Mwki] [^115gLN9r].

> Now, the clinical presentation. Marginal abruption more often presents with revealed vaginal bleeding, sometimes with no or only mild abdominal pain, uterine irritability, and potential triggering of preterm labor, whereas central abruption can present with concealed bleeding, increased pain, and higher likelihood of acute fetal compromise, though these are patterns rather than rules, and exceptions occur frequently in practice [^112vWGdY] [^114Vkjri] [^117BkiyR]. Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I was going to say "concealed abruption equals maternal tachycardia", but that would be misleading; maternal tachycardia is a nonspecific sign of hypovolemia or pain and should not be used alone to infer concealment without corroborating findings such as uterine tone, tenderness, and fetal status, so I need to correct that and emphasize holistic assessment of vitals, uterine findings, and fetal monitoring in context [^112kuoTr] [^115hVHE2]. Let me also reconsider the chronic or "atypical" phenotype with recurring light bleeding; it can reflect marginal, subchorionic, or subamniotic hematomas and may evade antepartum detection, underscoring the importance of serial assessments when symptoms persist [^116AW1gW] [^114EzRRp].

> I will now examine diagnosis and imaging, but I should not jump to conclusions. The diagnosis of abruption remains primarily clinical, supported by history, examination, and fetal monitoring; ultrasound lacks sensitivity for small or recent retroplacental or submembranous hematomas, so a normal scan does not rule out abruption, and MRI can outperform ultrasound for placental hemorrhage characterization when available and safe to obtain in the acute setting [^112kuoTr] [^114EzRRp]. Hold on, I should verify special contexts: in trauma, CT obtained for maternal evaluation can incidentally demonstrate placental hypoenhancement and help risk-stratify, though decisions remain clinical and prioritized to maternal stabilization, and in labor units, apparent "normal" internal scalp electrode tracings can be maternal in origin, masking fetal demise due to concealed abruption — both are situations where careful interpretation prevents missteps [^1153kkc9] [^116xWTMT]. I need to ensure placenta previa is excluded in bleeding presentations with appropriate ultrasound assessment, as management diverges significantly, and guidelines support confirming low-lying placenta location close to delivery when planning Cesarean for previa, a separate but crucial differential consideration [^114Ze2Bw].

> Next, I should review laboratory evaluation and coagulopathy risk. Abruption can precipitate consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenemia; fibrinogen thresholds around 3 g/L in pregnancy may already represent abnormal consumption given physiologic elevation, and levels below 2–3 g/L correlate with substantially increased risk of severe maternal complications, guiding early replacement strategies while definitive management proceeds [^112gjKnr]. I should confirm that disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur even in earlier gestation presentations with significant abruption and hemorrhage, as highlighted by case-based evidence, reminding me to trend fibrinogen, platelets, PT/INR, aPTT, and to prepare for massive transfusion if deterioration occurs [^111GSe3r] [^112kuoTr].

> Management now needs to be structured by severity and gestational age, and I should double-check key triggers for delivery. In all cases, stabilize the mother first, obtain IV access, initiate type and crossmatch, transfuse as indicated, and continuously assess fetal status; at or near term, urgent delivery is indicated with maternal or fetal compromise, while in stable presentations with reassuring status and very small separations, carefully monitored vaginal delivery may be reasonable, acknowledging that rapid escalation may be required if bleeding or status worsens [^115hVHE2] [^112kuoTr]. I need to ensure that blood component therapy is guided by labs and clinical bleeding, consider viscoelastic testing when available, and anticipate DIC management if severe abruption evolves, aligning with contemporary algorithms in acute near-term and term abruption care [^115hVHE2]. I should confirm that when fetal demise has occurred, vaginal delivery is generally preferred unless maternal indications necessitate Cesarean, with active coagulopathy management throughout [^112kuoTr].

> Let me consider marginal-specific management nuances. When abruption is characterized as small or marginal without maternal or fetal compromise, the risk of significant fetal blood loss and neonatal anemia appears low, though not zero; this supports individualized expectant intrapartum management with vigilant monitoring and postnatal hemoglobin checks if any concern arises, avoiding complacency but also avoiding unnecessary intervention when the risk profile is truly low [^117BkiyR] [^115hVHE2]. Wait, I should verify that "small" in obstetric documentation is subjective; clinical vigilance must not rely on that descriptor alone without objective maternal-fetal assessments and trajectory of bleeding and uterine activity [^112kuoTr].

> Preterm abruption deserves separate attention. I should confirm that preterm presentations are often more symptomatic and carry higher risks of maternal intensive care admission, coagulopathy, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and neonatal intensive care admission, which increases the complexity of balancing maternal stabilization, steroid and magnesium administration when feasible, and timely delivery when deterioration is evident or imminent [^113EJyd5] [^1114iZaa]. Hold on, let me ensure I'm not overgeneralizing; while some matched analyses suggest abruption itself is not the sole driver of poor preterm infant outcomes beyond the effect of prematurity, the aggregate evidence shows elevated neonatal risk profiles in abruption-associated preterm births that require heightened surveillance and supportive care planning [^113G1RPJ] [^1114iZaa].

> I should review neonatal outcomes tied to abruption. Among very low birth weight infants, abruption is associated with increased odds of intraventricular hemorrhage, including severe IVH, reinforcing the importance of perinatal neuroprotective strategies and tailored neonatal care after such deliveries, particularly when delivery is precipitous or resuscitation is complex [^111VjYhs]. Conversely, a large national database study did not demonstrate an association between abruption and necrotizing enterocolitis in VLBW infants, possibly because other dominant NEC risk factors in this population overshadow any abruption signal, though this should be interpreted within the limitations of administrative data [^112gbMF9]. I should confirm again that neonatal anemia occurs in a minority but not negligible proportion of abruption-exposed neonates overall, with risk higher when abruption is not documented as small, informing early hemoglobin assessment protocols in the nursery or NICU [^117BkiyR].

> I need to consider maternal longer-term outcomes. Placental abruption has been associated with subsequent maternal heart failure risk on medium-term follow-up, an association modified by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and mediated partly by preterm birth, which supports cardiovascular risk assessment and primary prevention planning postpartum for affected patients [^117V5vFo]. But wait, what if a patient develops unusual endocrine symptoms postpartum after severe abruption? There are rare reports of acute diabetes insipidus in the postpartum period linked to placental vasopressinase release after abruption and delivery of placenta, reminding me to evaluate polyuria and hypernatremia with an eye toward vasopressinase-mediated V2 receptor dysfunction and DDAVP responsiveness when the clinical picture fits [^117Miea4].

> Recurrence risk and prevention strategies should be reviewed carefully. Prior abruption confers markedly increased recurrence risk, so I should counsel on optimization of modifiable risks: strict hypertension control, smoking and substance cessation, interpregnancy interval planning, and management of multiple gestation risks when applicable, while recognizing that some upstream drivers reflect placental developmental biology beyond immediate modification [^115wMG1R] [^114Vkjri]. Let me consider IPD prevention frameworks: low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention in appropriate high-risk patients may reduce a subset of ischemic placental disease pathways, though abruption-specific prevention data are less definitive, and first-trimester uterine artery Dopplers can help risk-stratify impaired placentation but are not abruption-specific diagnostics, so I should not overpromise predictive utility [^112oMLMk] [^113a5yad]. Biomarkers such as elevated MSAFP have limited sensitivity for abruption prediction and should not be used in isolation for abruption screening, and psychosocial stressors such as bereavement, particularly in those with chronic hypertension, may heighten risk, meriting integrated obstetric and mental health support during and before pregnancy when identified [^115gLN9r] [^116PT2TL].

> Special scenarios merit forethought. In maternal trauma, CT obtained for injury evaluation can show placental hypoenhancement consistent with abruption and correlate with the likelihood of delivery for nonreassuring fetal status, but maternal stabilization always dominates decision-making, and fetal monitoring plus obstetric assessment remain paramount after imaging is complete [^1153kkc9]. Rare mechanical precipitants like uterine torsion can mimic severe abruption with profound fetal compromise; rapid surgical recognition is lifesaving even when the initial diagnosis is framed as suspected abruption, emphasizing the need to reassess intraoperative findings and anatomy meticulously when the clinical course deviates from expectations [^112s2vmp]. I should also remember to distinguish bleeding from placenta previa via ultrasound and recognize that cord insertion anomalies or placental morphologies may coexist but are not themselves diagnostic of abruption, which remains a clinical syndrome requiring integration of all data [^114Ze2Bw].

> Pathology and timing deserve a careful caveat. Let me verify that placental pathology can corroborate abruption in many but not all clinically diagnosed cases, with modest sensitivity, and that attempts to time abruption events from histology are limited and should be interpreted cautiously in clinical and medicolegal contexts, as early findings like maternal surface indentations can appear within minutes while other lesions reflect longer bleeding intervals [^113ndaSj]. In second-trimester losses, histologic abruption and inflammation are common contributors, but again, pathology complements rather than replaces clinical diagnosis and does not always provide precise temporal resolution [^111UEGgF].

> To synthesize, marginal placental abruption typically presents with revealed bleeding and relatively less pain, yet it shares the same pathophysiologic backbone as other abruption phenotypes and can progress, so I need to maintain high suspicion, integrate clinical findings with imaging that has known limits, track coagulation parameters proactively, and individualize delivery timing by severity and gestational age while counseling about recurrence and broader cardiovascular implications after recovery [^115hVHE2] [^112gjKnr] [^1114iZaa] [^115wMG1R]. Hold on, I should end by reiterating a safety check: a normal ultrasound does not exclude abruption, small marginal separations can still evolve, and maternal stabilization must always precede fetal interventions, with readiness to escalate to delivery if bleeding, uterine activity, or fetal status worsens despite initial reassuring features [^114EzRRp] [^112kuoTr].

---

Marginal placental abruption is the **premature separation of the placenta at its edge**, causing vaginal bleeding with minimal abdominal pain or uterine tenderness [^115hVHE2] [^112vWGdY]. It is diagnosed clinically, with ultrasound as an adjunct, and managed based on maternal and fetal stability and gestational age [^114EzRRp] [^112kuoTr]. Conservative management is appropriate when both are **stable**, while **delivery is indicated** if there is compromise or at term [^115hVHE2]. Marginal abruption increases risks of preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal anemia, and recurrence risk is higher in subsequent pregnancies [^115wMG1R].

---

## Pathophysiology

Marginal abruption involves **separation at the placental edge**, leading to bleeding between the placenta and uterine wall and reduced placental perfusion, which can cause fetal hypoxia and growth restriction [^111Jas3a]. It is linked to uteroplacental vascular insufficiency, chronic hypertension, and acute events such as trauma or sudden uterine decompression [^112oMLMk] [^1153kkc9] [^112kuoTr] [^114Vkjri].

---

## Risk factors

Several maternal and pregnancy-related factors **increase the risk** of marginal placental abruption:

- **Hypertensive disorders**: Chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia significantly increase risk [^1114iZaa].
- **Smoking and substance use**: Cigarette smoking and cocaine use are strongly associated with abruption [^112kuoTr].
- **Previous abruption**: History of placental abruption markedly increases recurrence risk [^115wMG1R] [^112a6pYs].
- **Trauma**: Abdominal trauma or sudden uterine decompression (e.g. rapid membrane rupture) can precipitate abruption [^1153kkc9] [^112kuoTr].
- **Multiple gestation**: Twin or higher-order pregnancies increase risk [^112kuoTr].
- **Advanced maternal age**: Older maternal age is associated with increased risk [^112kuoTr].
- **Thrombophilia**: Inherited thrombophilic mutations (e.g. factor V Leiden) are linked to abruption [^112cwr9Y].

---

## Clinical presentation

Marginal placental abruption **typically presents** with:

- **Vaginal bleeding**: Usually dark red, may be minimal or moderate [^112kuoTr].
- **Mild abdominal pain or uterine tenderness**: Less severe than central abruption [^115hVHE2].
- **Uterine contractions**: May be present but are typically mild [^112kuoTr].
- **Fetal heart rate**: Usually normal or mildly affected [^111KtEdN].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of marginal placental abruption is **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging and laboratory tests:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to assess bleeding, uterine tenderness, and fetal well-being [^112kuoTr].
- **Ultrasound**: Limited sensitivity (25–50%) but can identify placental hematomas or separation.
- **MRI**: Superior to ultrasound in detecting placental hemorrhage, especially in complex cases [^114EzRRp].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, coagulation profile, and fibrinogen levels to assess maternal status and risk of coagulopathy [^112gjKnr].

---

## Management strategies

Management of marginal placental abruption **depends on gestational age, severity, and maternal-fetal stability** [^112kuoTr]. For stable patients with mild symptoms and a reassuring fetal status, **conservative management** is appropriate and includes hospitalization, bed rest, close monitoring, and corticosteroids if preterm [^115hVHE2]. When there is severe bleeding, maternal instability, or fetal compromise, **active management** is indicated and includes immediate delivery (usually cesarean), blood transfusion, and aggressive management of coagulopathy [^112kuoTr].

---

## Maternal and fetal complications

Marginal placental abruption is associated with **significant maternal and fetal complications** [^1114iZaa]:

| **Maternal complications** | **Fetal complications** |
|-|-|
| - Postpartum hemorrhage [^1114iZaa] | - Preterm birth [^1114iZaa] |
| - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^1114iZaa] | - Fetal growth restriction [^1114iZaa] |
| - Acute renal failure [^1114iZaa] | - Neonatal anemia [^117BkiyR] |
| - Maternal shock | - Neonatal asphyxia |
| - Increased risk of cardiovascular disease [^117V5vFo] | - Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [^111VjYhs] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence risk

The prognosis of marginal placental abruption **depends on severity, gestational age, and timeliness of management** [^1114iZaa]. In subsequent pregnancies, the **recurrence risk** is significantly increased, particularly if the initial abruption occurred at term or was associated with hypertensive disorders [^115wMG1R] [^112a6pYs].

---

## Preventive measures and interventions

Preventive strategies **focus on risk-factor modification and close surveillance** in high-risk pregnancies. Measures include strict blood pressure control during pregnancy, smoking cessation, avoidance of trauma through patient education, and regular prenatal visits with ultrasound surveillance for high-risk patients [^112oMLMk].

Marginal placental abruption is characterized by **edge separation with vaginal bleeding** and mild symptoms [^115hVHE2]. Management is individualized based on **stability and gestational age**, with conservative care for stable cases and delivery for compromise [^112kuoTr]. The condition carries increased risks of preterm birth, growth restriction, and neonatal anemia, with higher recurrence in future pregnancies [^1114iZaa] [^115wMG1R].

### Analysis of risk factors of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^112vWGdY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Common maternal complications include placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and HELLP syndrome, while fetal complications mainly include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal distress, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, abnormal diastolic blood flow signals, premature delivery, and stillbirth.

- **Diagnostic criteria for placental abruption**: The placental abruption surface does not exceed one-third of the placental area. The signs are not obvious, the main symptoms are a large amount of vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain or mild abdominal pain, and the fetal heart rate is normal.

- **Diagnostic criteria for postpartum hemorrhage**: The amount of blood loss reaches or exceeds 500 mL within 24 hours after the delivery of the fetus.

- **Diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction (FGR)**: Fetal head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference are measured by ultrasound, and fetal weight (EFW) is estimated by substituting the HadlockC formula. FGR is diagnosed if EFW is less than the 10th percentile of the same gestational age.

- **Diagnostic criteria for fetal distress**: The fetus in the womb experiences acute or chronic hypoxia endangering health and life syndrome, mainly manifested as abnormal fetal heart rate during delivery, amniotic fluid meconium contamination, and abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring (late deceleration, frequent mutation deceleration). Abnormal fetal movement includes hypoxia with initial frequent fetal movements followed by weakening, reduction, and then disappearance. Intrauterine distress is diagnosed if any of the above criteria are met.

### Incidence and recurrence rate of placental abruption: A longitudinal linked national cohort study in the Netherlands [^115wMG1R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Women who have experienced a placental abruption have a risk of recurrence, but exact information to quantify this risk is currently not available. We studied the incidence and recurrence rate of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy and the influence of hypertensive disorders.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective national cohort study of all singleton pregnancies that ended from 1999–2007 in the Netherlands. A longitudinal linked national cohort of these women with information on a subsequent singleton delivery was used. We calculated and compared incidence and recurrence rates of placental abruption for women in total, stratified by gestational age of first placental abruption and by the presence of a hypertensive disorder in their first pregnancy.

- **Results**: We studied 1,570,635 women, of which 3,496 (0.22%) experienced a placental abruption. Information was available for 264,424 subsequent singleton deliveries. Of these, 521 women (0.20%) had a placental abruption in the first pregnancy compared to 214 women (0.08%) in the second pregnancy. The risk of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy was significantly higher in women with a previous placental abruption compared to women without (5.8% vs. 0.06%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 93; 95% confidence interval, 62–139). Women with a placental abruption that occurred at term in their first pregnancy were more at risk for recurrence (aOR, 188; 95% CI, 116–306) than women with a preterm (aOR, 52; 95% CI, 25–111) or early preterm (< 32 weeks of gestation) placental abruption in their first.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^1166u6Aq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Efforts to elucidate risk factors for placental abruption are imperative due to the severity of complications it poses for both mother and fetus and its contribution to preterm birth. Ethnicity-based differences in the risk of placental abruption and preterm birth have been reported. We tested the hypotheses that race, after adjusting for other factors, is associated with the risk of placental abruption at specific gestational ages, and that there is a greater contribution of placental abruption to the increased risk of preterm birth in Black mothers compared to White mothers.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Missouri Department of Health's maternally-linked database of all births in Missouri (1989–1997) to assess racial effects on placental abruption and its contribution to preterm birth at different gestational age categories (n = 664,303).

- **Results**: Among 108,806 births to Black mothers and 555,497 births to White mothers, 1.02% (95% CI 0.96–1.08) of Black births were complicated by placental abruption, compared to 0.71% (95% CI 0.69–0.73) of White births (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22–1.43). The magnitude of risk of placental abruption for Black mothers, compared to White mothers, increased with younger gestational age categories. The risk of placental abruption resulting in term and extreme preterm births (< 28 weeks) was higher for Black mothers (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29 and aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.58–2.48, respectively). Compared to White women delivering in the same gestational age category, there were a significant association between racial differences and preterm birth outcomes.

### The association between serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, placental growth factor, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio in singleton pregnancy and placental abruption: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111GijDR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate whether women with singleton pregnancies who experienced subsequent placental abruption had lower serum placental growth factor concentrations, higher serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations, and a higher soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio compared to women with singleton pregnancies without placental abruption.

- **Data sources**: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched electronically until March 2025, utilizing combinations of relevant medical subject heading terms, keywords, and suitable word variants for the topic.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: The review included prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies and case-control studies. Excluded from the systematic review were case reports, editorials, letters to the editor, and conference abstracts.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: The study assessed differences in placental growth factor levels, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations, and the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio between cases of placental abruption and controls without placental abruption. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Continuous data were expressed as the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval, provided the measurement units for outcomes were consistent. A random effects model was employed during the meta-analysis.

### Vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks gestation due to placental abruption leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation and fetal loss after appearing to satisfy criteria for routine threatened abortion: a case report and brief review of the literature [^111GSe3r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

We present a case of placental abruption with concomitant disseminated intravascular coagulation in a woman who presented with vaginal bleeding. A 32-year-old pregnant woman at 17 and 4/7 weeks gestation with a 1-month history of intermittent abdominal pain presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with 1 hour of vaginal bleeding. Upon initial history, the patient reported that she was diagnosed with "blood behind the placenta" the day before and was discharged on pelvic precautions. An ED ultrasound confirmed the sub-amniotic hematoma with placental hematoma and a viable intrauterine fetus. A low fibrinogen level suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation, and increasing hemorrhage necessitated dilation and evacuation and multiple units of blood products on an emergent basis. Only a few cases have been described in the literature demonstrating disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients at fewer than 20 weeks gestation with routine ultrasound findings of live intrauterine pregnancy and subchorionic hemorrhage.

### Prediction and prevention of ischemic placental disease [^112oMLMk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and placental abruption are obstetrical conditions that constitute the syndrome of ischemic placental disease (IPD), the leading cause of indicated preterm birth and an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. While the phenotypic manifestations vary significantly for preeclampsia, IUGR, and abruption, these conditions may share a common underlying etiology as evidenced by:

1. Shared clinical risk factors.
2. Increased recurrence risk across pregnancies, as well as increased co-occurrence of IPD conditions within a pregnancy.
3. Findings that suggest the underlying pathophysiologic processes may be similar.

IPD is of major clinical importance and accounts for a large proportion of indicated preterm delivery ranging from the periviable to late preterm period. Successful prevention of IPD and resultant preterm delivery could substantially improve neonatal and maternal outcomes. This article will review the following topics:

- **The complicated research literature on aspirin and the prevention of preeclampsia and IUGR**: Research evidence on other medical interventions to prevent IPD.
- **New clinical interventions currently under investigation, including statins**: Clinical recommendations for prevention of ischemic placental disease.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: A case report and literature review [^114e1tF5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

The patient was a pregnant woman (gravida 1, para 0) aged 33 years with a singleton pregnancy at 30 + 5 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy course, including fetal growth and prenatal examination, was regular. Except for a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy treated with progesterone, there were no prenatal abnormalities, and the patient denied any trauma or sexual history.

On the afternoon of the day before this visit, obstetric examination and ultrasonography were performed in our hospital to evaluate the condition of the fetus and placenta. Ultrasonography showed a single fetus and umbilical cord around the neck, a normal amniotic fluid volume, and fetal biological measurements appropriate for 32 weeks of gestation. The placenta was attached to the uterine anterior wall, with a placental thickness of 23 mm.

- **Emergency department admission**: The patient was admitted due to persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen, which began two hours before admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Physical examination showed a temperature of 36.5 °C, pulse of 100 beats per minute, respiration of 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg. The patient had clear consciousness and a pale complexion.

- **Obstetric examination findings**: Uterine growth was suitable for gestational age. Abdominal tenderness was positive, and uterine tension was high. Uterine contractions were not significantly detected.

### The ability of computed tomography to diagnose placental abruption in the trauma patient [^1153kkc9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Fetal demise following trauma remains a devastating complication, largely owing to placental injury and abruption. Our objective was to determine if abdominopelvic computed tomographic (CT) imaging can assess for placental abruption (PA) when obtained to exclude associated maternal injuries.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review of pregnant trauma patients of 20-week gestation or longer, presenting to a trauma center during a 7-year period, who underwent CT imaging as part of their initial evaluation. Radiographic images were reviewed by a radiologist for evidence of PA and classified based on the percentage of visualized placental enhancement. Blinded to CT results, charts were reviewed by an obstetrician for clinical evidence of PA and classified as strongly positive, possibly positive, or no evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 176 patients met inclusion criteria. CT imaging revealed evidence of PA in 61 patients (35%). As the percentage of placental enhancement decreased, patients were more likely to have strong clinical manifestations of PA, reaching statistical significance when enhancement was less than 50%. CT imaging evidence of PA was apparent in all patients who required delivery for non-assuring fetal heart tones.

- **Conclusion**: CT imaging evaluation of the placenta can accurately identify PA and therefore help stratify patients at risk for fetal complications. The likelihood of requiring delivery increased as placental enhancement declined to less than 25%.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112j9X3f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is a serious complication of pregnancy, with an incidence rate among pregnant women ranging from 0.6% to 1.2%. Despite its relatively low occurrence, it can lead to severe obstetric complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, peripartum hysterectomy, amniotic fluid embolism, severe respiratory distress, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and even maternal mortality. Furthermore, placental abruption negatively impacts the long-term prognosis for both mothers and newborns, increasing morbidity and mortality rates.

The prognosis for patients with placental abruption is closely related to early accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. However, due to its nonspecific symptoms, insidious onset, and rapid progression, the rates of missed and misdiagnosis are high, making diagnosis particularly challenging. Therefore, timely identification of the risk factors for placental abruption is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on the potential risk factors for placental abruption, including advanced maternal age, chronic hypertension, multiparity, preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, and previous medical history. However, due to differences in study design, sample sizes, and assessment methods, the conclusions in the existing literature show considerable inconsistency. Some early studies suggested that preeclampsia is not a risk factor for placental abruption, while more recent studies indicate that preeclampsia is actually an independent risk factor.

### The role of heat shock proteins in placental ischemic disease: A narrative review of the current literature [^116WqiHg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are collectively referred to as placental ischemic disease (PID). This classification arises from their common features of uteroplacental malperfusion, chronic hypoxia, and placental ischemia. These conditions result from inadequate trophoblast invasion and incomplete remodeling of the spiral arteries during placentation.

At approximately 8–10 weeks of gestation, the maternal vessels undergo remodeling, thereby eliminating cytotrophoblast plugging and permitting perfusion of the intervillous space. This augmented perfusion not only enhances the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the embryo but also precipitates two particularly significant outcomes. First, the increased oxygen delivery induces oxidative stress, necessitating buffering mechanisms. Second, the elevated partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) facilitates the conversion of cytotrophoblasts into an invasive phenotype.

### Prediction of fetal acidemia in placental abruption [^111KtEdN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

The approval of the institutional review board (Tokyo Women's Medical University) was obtained before the start of this retrospective, case–control study. All singleton births, born between 24 and 40 weeks of gestation from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009, were included. The medical records of mothers and neonates in the 94 institutes where these infants were born, comprising the Perinatal Research Network in Japan (PRNJ) listed in the acknowledgements, were reviewed.

Gestational age was determined based on the mother's last menstrual period and first and second trimester obstetric ultrasonography. More than 30 variables were assessed, including pregestational and perinatal factors. Preeclampsia/superimposed preeclampsia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy. Details of the diagnosis, onset place, time from onset of symptoms to admission/delivery, and clinical management of any relevant condition were recorded.

The diagnosis of placental abruption was based primarily on one or more of the following clinical manifestations: vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, with or without an abnormal FHR tracing, and confirmed placental detachment after delivery. The presence of hematoma during a cesarean section or coagulation/massive genital bleeding during vaginal delivery was considered to indicate placental detachment. Women found to have a healthy placenta, and those with chronic abruption, were excluded from this study.

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: a retrospective study [^113EJyd5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The timing of placental abruption (PA) onset significantly influences maternal and neonatal outcomes. PA, an obstetric emergency with an unclear etiology, significantly contributes to premature births, accounting for 15 million births worldwide each year and serving as the second leading risk factor for death in children under 5 years old. Premature birth is believed to be a clinical syndrome resulting from various pathological processes.

In this retrospective study, our findings underscored the significant impact of PA on both maternal and neonatal health, particularly in the context of preterm deliveries. Compared with full-term women with PA, preterm pregnancies with PA showed a much higher risk of uterus-placenta apoplexy (aOR: 2.93, 95% CI 1.33–6.47, P = 0.01), fetal growth restriction (aOR: 3.47, 95% CI 1.45–8.30, P = 0.01), and adult ICU admission (aOR: 3.28, 95% CI 1.27–8.46, P = 0.01), accompanied by a higher risk of neonatal stillbirth (aOR: 9.38, 95% CI 1.10–79.68, P < 0.01) and NICU admission (aOR: 47.17, 95% CI 27.23–81.70, P < 0.01). This study provides more valuable insights into the management of PA and may pave the way for enhanced outcomes for pregnant women and newborns.

The differences in outcomes between term and preterm pregnancies with PA can be attributed to the distinct clinical presentations and management challenges associated with PA at different gestational ages. Preterm PA often presents with more severe symptoms and requires urgent intervention, which may explain the higher incidence of maternal complications such as uterus-placenta apoplexy and fetal growth restriction.

### Fibrinogen for the prediction of severe maternal complications in placental abruption with fetal death after 24 weeks of gestation [^112gjKnr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

In our series, the risk of serious complications was almost six times greater when the initial fibrinogen level was below 2 g/L and 2.5 times greater when it was below 3 g/L. This result is consistent with those reported in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which indicate that fibrinogen levels less than 3 g/L are associated with a doubled risk of serious hemorrhage, even though blood fibrinogen levels between 2 and 3 g/L are considered normal apart from the context of pregnancy. Besides, in pregnant individuals, a concentration of 3 g/L corresponds approximately to the first centile of normal values. Therefore, a drop in fibrinogen below 3 g/L may already indicate abnormal fibrinogen consumption, masked by the physiological increase of fibrinogen levels during pregnancy.

The literature about the management of placental abruption with intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) is very limited, being based on small series. The low prevalence of the condition and its multifactorial approach make its management challenging and difficult. In addition, at the time of writing, no usable clinical trial or randomized study has succeeded in standardizing the management of such an important clinical condition. No previous study has specifically analyzed the association between laboratory indicators at admission and the subsequent course.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168SVVi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Identifying and implementing preventive measures for risk factors associated with pregnancy complications are crucial strategies for avoiding placental abruption. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, have been widely recognized as significant risk factors for placental abruption. Hypertension can lead to arteriosclerosis of small arteries at the site of placental attachment, resulting in ischemia, necrosis, or even rupture and hematoma formation in distal capillaries. These conditions may compress the placenta and lead to its premature detachment.

Once placental abruption occurs, it typically presents as widespread and rapidly progressing, making it prone to misdiagnosis. Therefore, for patients with gestational hypertension, symptoms such as bleeding, uterine tenderness, or frequent contractions should raise a high suspicion for the possibility of placental abruption. Premature rupture of membranes is also considered a risk factor for placental abruption, potentially related to intrauterine infection and sudden decreases in uterine pressure. Premature rupture can lead to a sharp decline in intrauterine pressure, triggering the separation of the decidua from the membranes, activating prostaglandin factors, and resulting in uterine contractions and placental abruption. Additionally, polyhydramnios can increase intrauterine pressure, affecting placental blood flow and further elevating the risk of placental abruption. If a pregnant woman with polyhydramnios experiences membrane rupture, the sudden drop in intrauterine pressure can exacerbate these risks.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for termination of pregnancy, particularly in evaluating placenta accreta, SFP 2024 guidelines recommend identifying the placental location in all patients with a uterine scar presenting for a second-trimester abortion. A detailed evaluation with ultrasound should be obtained if a complete previa is identified.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^112Z7mLJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

In this study, we examined the association among placental abruption, preterm birth, and maternal race. We found that self-reported Black maternal race, compared to White race, was significantly associated with an increased risk of placental abruption, even after adjusting for SES and maternal medical risk factors. These findings confirmed previous epidemiological studies showing an increased risk of placental abruption in Black mothers compared to White mothers. We also observed that the relative risk increase for placental abruption for Black mothers was greater at earlier gestational age categories compared to White mothers.

Since we confirmed Black race to be a risk factor for placental abruption, and both Black race and placental abruption have been identified as risk factors for PTB, we expected a greater contribution of placental abruption to the increased risk of PTB in Black mothers. However, we did not find that to be the case. We found that for the subset of women delivering preterm, there was a significantly lower proportion of placental abruption in Black mothers compared to White mothers. Conversely, for the subset of women delivering at term, there was a significantly higher proportion of placental abruption in Black mothers compared to White mothers.

### Risk factors and adverse fetal outcomes in umbilical artery thrombosis: a comparison with single umbilical artery [^116Ag4i3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Placental abnormalities included abruption, previa, marginal cord insertion, velamentous cord insertion, circumvallate, amnion nodosum, succenturiate, and other miscellaneous placental abnormalities. In this study, abnormal umbilical cord insertions were recognized as notable risk factors for the occurrence of single umbilical artery (SUA).

Due to the simultaneous development of the umbilical artery and the placenta, the relationship between placental abnormalities and SUA remains a subject of controversy. Some studies indicate that SUA increases the risk of placental abnormalities, while other research suggests that placental anomalies may serve as a risk factor for SUA. Furthermore, this study revealed that IVF was an independent risk factor for SUA, corroborating the results of Siargkas et al.

The most plausible explanation for why IVF is a significant risk factor may be its influence on the in vitro development of the chorion, potentially affecting placenta formation and predisposing patients to morphological abnormalities such as SUA. Although a history of cesarean birth is known to adversely affect pregnancy outcomes, its impact on SUA remains unreported. This research uniquely identified prior cesarean delivery as an independent risk factor for SUA. We hypothesize that cesarean delivery-induced uterine damage may impact placental development, subsequently affecting umbilical artery formation. However, this requires further validation with more clinical data. Additionally, a meta-analysis identified maternal nulliparity as a potential risk factor for SUA.

### Elevated maternal second-trimester serum alpha-fetoprotein as a risk factor for placental abruption [^115gLN9r]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

The study aimed to analyze the association between second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (MSbeta-hCG) levels with placental abruption.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven women with placental abruption and 108 control women without placental abruption were tested for second-trimester MSAFP and MSbeta-hCG levels as part of a trisomy 21 screening program. Discriminatory cutoff levels for MSAFP were sought to predict placental abruption.

- **Results**: The median MSAFP multiples of the median (MoM) was significantly higher in the abruption group (1.21) than in the control group (1.07) (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, elevated MSAFP remained an independent risk factor for placental abruption, adjusting for factors such as parity ≥ 3, smoking, previous placental abruption, preeclampsia, bleeding in the second or third trimester, and placenta previa. MSAFP ≥ 1.5 MoM had a sensitivity of 29% and a false-positive rate of 10%. The levels of MSbeta-hCG MoM did not differ between the cases and the controls.

- **Conclusion**: While second-trimester MSAFP levels are higher in women with subsequent placental abruption, the clinical usefulness of this test is limited due to its low sensitivity and high false-positive rate.

### The histologic evolution of revealed, acute abruptions [^113ndaSj]. Human pathology (2017). Low credibility.

There is considerable interest in using pathology to confirm acute abruptions. It has been suggested that pathologic findings can help determine the timing of abruptions. Because of the dearth of evidence in the literature supporting this claim and its medicolegal implications, we undertook this study to explore the possibility of timing abruptions by histopathology.

We sought to correlate bleeding interval (duration from maternal presentation with vaginal bleeding [revealed abruption] to placental delivery) with placental histopathologic findings. We performed a retrospective review of clinical data and placental pathology from all cases of clinically diagnosed, acute, revealed abruptions at a single, large institution in New England between 2000 and 2015. Cases were identified based on clinical diagnoses, bleeding intervals were calculated from clinical notes, and histologic evaluations were performed by two pathologists blinded to the bleeding intervals.

A total of 177 cases were analyzed. Of these, 103 (58%) had histologic findings corroborating the clinical diagnosis of abruption. The most frequent finding was maternal surface indentation (51 cases) followed by intravillous hemorrhage (50 cases). The former was also the earliest finding, with a minimum bleeding interval of 4 minutes. In multivariate modeling, plasma cell deciduitis was significantly associated with a longer bleeding interval (median 63 hours). If there were two pathologic findings, there was a trend toward a longer bleeding interval. There was modest sensitivity for the pathologic diagnosis of abruption.

### Placental abruption as a risk factor for heart failure [^117V5vFo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Complications of pregnancy present an opportunity to identify women at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Placental abruption is a severe and understudied pregnancy complication, and its relationship with CVD is poorly understood. The California Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database was used to identify women with hospitalized pregnancies in California between 2005 and 2009, with follow-up through 2011. Pregnancies, exposures, covariates, and outcomes were defined by International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to examine the association between placental abruption and myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF). Multivariate models controlling for age, race, medical co-morbidities, pregnancy complications, psychiatric and substance use disorders, and socioeconomic factors were employed. Among over 1.5 million pregnancies, placental abruption occurred in 14,881 women (1%). The median follow-up time from delivery to event or censoring was 4.87 years (interquartile range 3.54 to 5.96 years). In unadjusted models, placental abruption was associated with the risk of HF, but not MI or stroke. In fully adjusted models, placental abruption remained significantly associated with HF (hazard ratio 1.44; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.90). Among women with placental abruptions, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth respectively modified and mediated the association between placental abruption and HF. In conclusion, placental abruption is a risk factor for HF, particularly in women who…

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: A retrospective study [^116AW1gW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The higher proportion of asymptomatic women (Grade 0) in the full-term group in our study suggests that PA may be more likely to present with clinical symptoms in preterm pregnancies. This is supported by the lower proportion of positive ultrasound findings in the full-term group, which aligns with the study by Ni et al. (2019) reporting a higher sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting PA in preterm pregnancies. Contrarily, full-term women were more asymptomatic. This aligns with the understanding that the clinical presentation of PA can vary widely, and asymptomatic cases are not uncommon, particularly in the context of full-term pregnancies.

A study by Bāczkowska et al. from a Polish tertiary center also noted the varied clinical presentation of PA and its serious perinatal complications. In recent years, the increasing diagnosis of atypical PA doesn't present with typical heavy bleeding and severe pain but instead shows chronic or recurring light bleeding, making prenatal detection harder. As clinical pathology advances, obstetricians find it more challenging to spot these cases during routine prenatal checks, with some only confirmed postpartum via placental histopathology or fetal monitoring data review. This highlights the complexity of diagnosing atypical PA and emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to improve prenatal detection, postpartum evaluation, and overall management strategies to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Placental abruption at near-term and term gestations: Pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^115hVHE2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from its uterine attachment before the delivery of a fetus. The clinical manifestations of abruption typically include vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, accompanied by various abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. Clinical challenges arise when pregnant people with this condition present with profound vaginal bleeding, necessitating urgent delivery, especially when there is a concern for maternal and fetal compromise and coagulopathy.

Abruption occurs in 0.6% to 1.2% of all pregnancies, with nearly half of cases occurring at term gestations. An exposition of abruption at near-term (defined as the late preterm period from 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation) and term (defined as ≥ 37 weeks of gestation) provides unique insights into its direct effects, as risks associated with preterm birth do not impact outcomes. Here, we explore the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of abruption.

- **Pathophysiology**: We discuss the interaction of chronic processes, such as decidual and uteroplacental vasculopathy, and acute processes, like shearing forces applied to the abdomen, that underlie the pathophysiology.

- **Epidemiology**: Risk factors for abruption and strengths of association are summarized.

- **Diagnosis**: Sonographic findings of abruption and fetal heart rate tracings are presented.

- **Management**: We propose a management algorithm for acute abruption that incorporates blood loss, vital signs, and urine output, among other factors. Lastly, we discuss blood component therapy, viscoelastic point-of-care testing, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and management of blood component therapy.

### Acute diabetes insipidus mediated by vasopressinase after placental abruption [^117Miea4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Postpartum, diabetes insipidus (DI) can be part of Sheehan's syndrome or lymphocytic hypophysitis in combination with anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies. In contrast, acute onset of isolated DI in the postpartum period is unusual.

- **Case presentation**: This patient presented at 33 weeks gestation with placental abruption, prompting a cesarean delivery of twins. Immediately after delivery, she developed severe DI. The DI could be controlled with the vasopressinase-resistant 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), but not with arginine vasopressin (AVP), and it resolved within a few weeks.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the postpartum DI in this patient was caused by the release of placental vasopressinase into the maternal bloodstream.

- **Methods and results**: Cells were transiently transfected with the AVP receptor 2 (AVPR2) and treated with either AVP or DDAVP in the presence of the patient's serum collected postpartum or 10 weeks after delivery. The response to the different treatments was evaluated by measuring the activity of a cAMP-responsive firefly luciferase reporter construct. The in vitro studies demonstrate that the patient's postpartum serum disrupts activation of the AVPR2 by AVP, but not by the vasopressinase-resistant DDAVP.

- **Conclusions**: Placental abruption can rarely be associated with acute postpartum DI caused by the release of placental vasopressinase into the bloodstream. This clinical entity must be considered in patients with placental abruption and when evaluating patients presenting with DI after delivery.

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^112gbMF9]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

African American newborns are more vulnerable to developing NEC than those of other ethnicities. There is no clear explanation for ethnic disparities in neonatal NEC; however, other studies have shown the vulnerability of African American neonates to various diseases such as acute kidney injury and bilirubin neurotoxicity.

NEC was more frequently encountered in males than in females. Male vulnerability to NEC is consistent with the broader phenomenon known as the "Y chromosome effect", which identifies males as being more prone to various morbidities and mortality in both the fetal stage and early postnatal period, including prematurity, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The biological foundations of the mechanisms underlying this sex disparity remain obscure, and theories have speculated the roles of factors such as testosterone levels, heightened fetal metabolic rates, and molecular aberrations.

This study did not demonstrate an association between placental abruption and NEC in VLBW infants. One explanation for the lack of association between placental abruption and NEC could be the coexistence of multiple other risk factors in VLBW infants that have greater importance in the pathogenesis of NEC than placental abruption, such as SGA, neonatal anemia, and neonatal sepsis. In addition, VLBW infants suffer from intestinal dysbiosis and consequently are at a significantly increased risk of NEC. Placental abruption is mostly an acute event leading to emergency delivery. However, on some occasions, abruption is subacute.

### Associations between velamentous or marginal cord insertion and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies: a retrospective cohort study [^113B21CJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

The placenta is an essential temporary organ during pregnancy. As the link between the mother and the fetus, the placenta plays an important role in the transmission of nutrients and gases, endocrine synthesis, and immune barriers. It is the primary regulatory element in the adaptation of the mother to pregnancy and maintains the intrauterine environment. Hence, the development of placental structure and function is crucial for maternal and fetal health. Impairment of the placental structure or function may result in adverse short- and/or long-term outcomes. These outcomes include placental abnormalities such as placenta previa, accreta, abruption, and abnormal morphogenesis; placental-related diseases such as preeclampsia (PE), preterm delivery (PTD), intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal distress; and an increased risk for placenta-related chronic diseases in adulthood including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

Cord insertion abnormalities are common morphological abnormalities of the placenta where the umbilical cord does not insert into the center or the central neighborhood of the placental disk. The two main types of abnormal cord insertion are velamentous cord insertion (VCI) and marginal cord insertion (MCI), with a reported prevalence of 1.4% and 6.15%, respectively, in singleton pregnancies. Previous studies have revealed that VCI and MCI are associated with an increased risk of vasa previa, small-for-gestational age (SGA), PE, PTD, stillbirth, and emergency cesarean delivery in singleton pregnancies. Nevertheless, investigations on the impact of abnormal cord insertion in twin pregnancies remain limited.

### Diagnosis of an unsuspected maternal hemorrhage via fetal heart rate tracing [^116xWTMT]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Early detection of placental abruption often relies on the observation of vaginal bleeding; however, overt bleeding does not always occur. We report the case of an unsuspected placental abruption diagnosis that was prompted by an internal fetal scalp electrode tracing. The presence of a "normal" fetal heart rate (FHR) of approximately 150 beats per minute with poor variability, which matched the maternal heart rate (MHR), suggested that the tracing was not of fetal origin. An urgent ultrasound examination revealed a fetal demise with a possible concealed abruption, proving that the scalp electrode tracing was actually maternal in origin. Though reports of transmission of MHR via a deceased fetus are not new, it is uncommon for MHR to mimic a normal, reassuring FHR. This report reinforces the need for anesthesiologists to be adept at interpreting and integrating FHR monitors with maternal monitors prior to the initiation of epidural analgesia.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115a8tzz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The strength of this study lies in its inclusion of multifactorial analyses, which aim to minimize the confounding effects and provide a deeper exploration of the independent risk factors for placental abruption. However, several limitations in this study need to be acknowledged. Among the 51 studies included, 21 were of moderate quality. These studies have certain limitations in design and methodology, which may lead to increased bias and heterogeneity in the results. For example, some studies had shortcomings in exposure measurement and control of confounding variables, which could affect the accurate assessment of independent risk factors for placental abruption. Nevertheless, these studies still provide important clinical insights, suggesting that future research should focus on improving study design quality to enhance the understanding of risk factors for placental abruption.

The lack of data on the definition, types, and severity of placental abruption limited further subgroup analyses. When attempting subgroup analysis based on geographic region, the limited number of studies related to each risk factor made this analysis unfeasible. However, exploring regional differences in the prevalence of risk factors is crucial for the field, and future research should give this more attention. Despite our systematic literature search aimed at including all relevant studies, the asymmetry observed in the funnel plot suggests the potential for publication bias. This bias may arise from the absence of unpublished negative results.

### The effect of placental abruption on the short-term outcome of premature infants [^113G1RPJ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of abruption on the outcome of preterm infants. Live-born infants of 23 to 32 weeks gestation born at Beaumont Hospital between 1995 and 1999 who suffered abruption constitute the study group. Controls were matched to cases by sex, gestational age, and birth weight. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for confirmation of abruption, determination of abruption grade, and subsequent neonatal outcome.

- **Univariate analysis**: The grade 2 abruption group revealed statistically significant differences in time from diagnosis to delivery (p = 0.04), Apgar scores at 5 minutes (p = 0.04), and acidotic cord blood (p = 0.04) between cases and controls. However, no differences in short-term outcome were appreciated.

- **Mortality and morbidity**: No differences were noted between grade 1 abruption case and control infants.

We conclude that abruption is not an independent risk factor for poor outcome among infants born between 23 and 32 weeks gestation, but instead induces the preterm delivery that is the main determinant of outcome.

### Thrombophilic mutations are a main risk factor for placental abruption [^112cwr9Y]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate inherited thrombophilic factor V Leiden and factor II A20210 mutations in women presenting with abruption of a normally implanted placenta.

In a multi-center, case-control study, 50 consecutive women requiring immediate delivery because of abruption of the placenta were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: abruptio placentae requiring immediate delivery, normally implanted placenta, Caucasian ethnic background, parity 5 cm, illicit drug abuse, premature rupture of membranes, and multiple pregnancy. One hundred Caucasian women with uneventful pregnancies carried to term, matched for parity and age, served as controls.

Heterozygotes were found to be significantly more prevalent among women with abruptio placentae than among controls. The carriership of the FV Leiden mutation confers an OR of 9.12 (95% C. I.: 2.18–31.7; p = 0.0005). Women carrying the F II A20210 mutation have an OR of 12.25 (95% C. I.: 2.36–29.6; p = 0.0004). No homozygotes or double heterozygotes were found. Twenty-three patients (46%) also met the criteria for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (PE). In such cases, the prevalence of mutations (factor V: 6 cases, 26.1%; factor II: 5 cases, 21.7%) was similar to that in women without pre-eclampsia (factor V: 5 cases, 18.7%; factor II: 5 cases, 18.5%).

### Prenatal ultrasound findings of circumvallate placenta and pregnancy outcomes [^116rXX9J]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if the prenatal diagnosis of circumvallate placenta is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Circumvallate placenta has a suggested association with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including antenatal bleeding, placental abruption, preterm birth, emergency cesarean, small for gestational age infants, and stillbirth.

- **Study design**: Pregnancies with a singleton gestation prenatally diagnosed with circumvallate placenta between January 1, 2012, and March 31, 2021, were identified, and adverse pregnancy outcomes were obtained. The rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared among those with prenatally diagnosed circumvallate placentas to those without this prenatal diagnosis, using a 4:1 control-matched group. Pregnancies with known fetal anomalies or other placental abnormalities were excluded. Statistical analyses included Student's t-test and Χ² with p < 0.05 considered significant.

- **Results**: Prenatal ultrasound findings of circumvallate placenta were seen in 179 pregnant people, accounting for 0.20% of all anatomic ultrasound studies and 0.17% of all deliveries. Diagnosis was made at a mean gestational age of 19.8 ± 2.4 weeks. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were similar between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Prenatal ultrasound findings of circumvallate placenta do not correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Given the overall good prognosis, prenatal diagnosis of circumvallate placenta may not warrant additional surveillance during pregnancy.

- **Key points**
- The risk of prenatally diagnosed circumvallate placenta was previously unclear.
- Prenatally diagnosed circumvallate placenta is not associated with adverse outcomes.

### Placental abruption and risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants: The United States national inpatient database [^111VjYhs]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the association of placental abruption with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

- **Methods**: We examined the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) datasets. Preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 grams were included. The odds ratios (OR) of developing IVH and severe IVH in association with placental abruption were calculated. Adjusted OR (aOR) were determined using logistic regression models.

- **Results**: The study included 113,445 VLBW infants. IVH occurred in 18.7% of infants born to mothers with a history of placental abruption compared to 14.7% in infants without placental abruption, aOR 1.25 (95% CI: 1.13–1.38), p < 0.001. Severe IVH occurred in 6.4% of infants born to mothers with a history of placental abruption versus 4.0% in those without placental abruption, aOR 1.53 (95% CI: 1.30–1.78), p < 0.001.

- **Conclusion**: Placental abruption is associated with an increased prevalence of IVH and severe IVH in VLBW infants.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113GWhrG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Globally, the incidence of placental abruption and its associated complications pose significant challenges to maternal and neonatal health. This issue is especially acute in resource-limited regions, where the lack of effective screening, diagnosis, and treatment methods exacerbates the high incidence and mortality rates of placental abruption, further deepening the global inequities in maternal and child health. Therefore, identifying the independent risk factors for placental abruption not only aids in the early identification of high-risk pregnancies but also contributes to the optimization of prenatal care worldwide, reducing unnecessary maternal and neonatal health losses.

This is crucial for reducing maternal mortality, improving neonatal health outcomes, and minimizing the wastage of medical resources. Although previous studies have attempted to summarize the risk factors for placental abruption, most have remained at the descriptive analysis level, without conducting in-depth statistical analysis of the inconsistent findings. Additionally, these studies lack a systematic summary of independent risk factors and fail to assess their clinical guidance value.

In response to the contradictions and shortcomings in the existing literature, this study aims to comprehensively review and analyze the independent risk factors for placental abruption through systematic review and meta-analysis. We hope that this research will provide clinicians with more reliable tools for risk factor identification, promoting the application of effective strategies in clinical practice.

### Major obstetric haemorrhage in Metro EAST, Cape Town, South Africa: A population-based cohort study using the maternal near-miss approach [^1162qDKL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

The finding of placental abruption as the main cause of major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) in our population cannot easily be compared with other populations since most studies report antepartum haemorrhage and postpartum haemorrhage separately. The fact that uterine atony is not the most frequent cause for MOH is probably also because our study combines MOH before, during, and after birth. This underlines the importance of including antepartum and intrapartum bleeding in studies of MOH, rather than limiting their scope to include postpartum haemorrhage only.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, placental abruption, and preterm labour are pathophysiologically related to early ischemic placental disease.

The fact that stillbirths occurred in 95% of women with abruption was not unexpected, given that the large majority presented already in shock or with symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Despite the knowledge that appropriate management is to deliver stillbirths vaginally, in daily practice, this is not always possible due to acute maternal compromise requiring surgical intervention. In this study, we reported a relatively high number of caesarean sections (CS) in cases of stillbirth. Indications were maternal condition too poor for induction of labour (3/7), having two or more previous caesarean sections (1/7, representing a relative contraindication to induce), failed induction (2/7), or ruptured uterus (1/7).

The high number of complications during and after CS can be related to the risk factors of the women in this population. The high percentage of women with obesity (26.9% BMI ≥ 30) and hypertensive disorders may complicate CS.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^1132EZ1u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

We find that Black women are at increased risk for placental abruption, especially at early gestational ages, but placental abruption makes up a smaller proportion of causes of PTB for Black women. In addition, the difference in relative contribution of placental abruption between term and preterm gestations suggests heterogeneity in clinical pathways between these two importantly different birth outcomes.

### Loss of a close family member the year before or during pregnancy and the risk of placental abruption: a cohort study from Denmark and Sweden [^116PT2TL]. Psychological Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with a modestly increased risk of fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. Since placental abruption shares similar pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors with fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, we hypothesized that maternal stress may be implicated in abruption risk. This study investigated the association between maternal bereavement during pregnancy and placental abruption.

- **Method**: We studied singleton births in Denmark (1978–2008) and Sweden (1973–2006), totaling 5,103,272 cases. Nationwide registries provided data on the death of women's close family members (older children, siblings, parents, and partners), abruption, and potential confounders.

- **Results**: A total of 30,312 (6/1000) pregnancies in the cohort were diagnosed with placental abruption. Among normotensive women, the death of a child the year before or during pregnancy was associated with a 54% increased odds of abruption [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30–1.82]; the increased odds were restricted to women who lost a child the year before or during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the group with chronic hypertension, the death of a child the year before or in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with eight-fold increased odds of abruption (odds ratio 8.17, 95% CI 3.17–21.10). The death of other relatives was not associated with abruption risk.

- **Conclusions**: Loss of a child the year before or in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of abruption, especially among women with chronic hypertension. Further studies are needed.

### State of the art: non-invasive ultrasound assessment of the uteroplacental circulation [^113a5yad]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Impaired trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries is associated with an increased risk for the subsequent development of intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and placental abruption. A series of screening studies involving the assessment of impedance to flow in the uterine arteries have examined the potential value of Doppler in identifying pregnancies at risk of complications from impaired placentation. Currently, we are able to characterize uteroplacental perfusion with both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This review will examine these methodologies and seek to highlight both conclusive and inconclusive findings.

### Late pregnancy bleeding [^114Szbup]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Effective management of vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy requires recognition of potentially serious conditions, including placenta previa, placental abruption, and vasa previa. Placenta previa is commonly diagnosed on routine ultrasonography before 20 weeks' gestation, but it ultimately resolves in nearly 90 percent of patients. Women who have asymptomatic previa can continue normal activities, with repeat ultrasonographic evaluation at 28 weeks. Persistent previa in the third trimester mandates pelvic rest and hospitalization if significant bleeding occurs. Placental abruption is the most common cause of serious vaginal bleeding, occurring in 1 percent of pregnancies. Management of abruption may require rapid operative delivery to prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality. Vasa previa is rare but can result in fetal exsanguination with rupture of membranes. Significant vaginal bleeding from any cause is managed with rapid assessment of maternal and fetal status, fluid resuscitation, replacement of blood products when necessary, and an appropriately timed delivery.

### Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy [^114EzRRp]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Placental abruption often begins with vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. It is defined as in utero separation of the placenta from the myometrium and causes 10–25% of prenatal deaths.

- **Types of placental haematoma**: The three types of placental haematoma are retroplacental, subchorionic, and subamniotic. Retroplacental haematomas, located posterior to the placenta, represent 43% of haematomas. Subchorionic haematomas, found between the chorion and the endometrium, represent approximately 57%. Subamniotic haematomas, located between the amnion and chorion, are rare.

- **US diagnostic performance**: The US diagnostic performance for detecting abruption is low; in fact, 25–50% of haematomas, mostly retroplacental, remain undetected because the echotexture of recent haemorrhage is similar to that of the placenta or due to their small dimensions. Moreover, clots resulting from chronic abruption may drain through the cervix. The most accurate ultrasound criteria for placenta abruption (sensitivity 80%, specificity 92%) are the detection of pre-/retroplacental collections, evidence of marginal subchorionic or intra-amniotic haematomas, increased placental thickness (> 5 cm), and jelly-like movements of the chorionic plate. Because of the low sensitivity of sonography in detecting small retroplacental or submembranous haematomas, or the occasional absence of bleeding with placental abruption, negative sonographic findings do not rule out the presence of placental abruption.

- **MR imaging superiority**: MR imaging is superior to US in the evaluation of placenta haemorrhage because it improves soft tissue contrast and has a wider field of view.

### Marginal cord insertion in the first trimester is associated with furcate cord insertion [^112X45B6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

- **Variations in the mode of marginal cord insertion**: A migration to normal cord insertion, B persistent marginal cord insertion, C progression to furcate cord insertion.

- **Ultrasound sonograms and gross specimens with persistent marginal cord insertion**: These demonstrated umbilical vessel branches in tight spirals inserted directly into the placental parenchyma. a) Energy Doppler of marginal cord insertion in the first trimester; b) Color Doppler of marginal cord insertion in the second trimester; c) Gross specimen with marginal cord insertion showed Wharton's jelly wrapping around the root of the cord.

- **Ultrasound sonograms and gross specimens with marginal cord insertion progression to furcate cord insertion**: a) Energy Doppler of furcate cord insertion in the first trimester; b, f, i) Color Doppler of marginal cord insertion showed umbilical vessel branches in tight spirals directly entering the placental parenchyma. c, d, g, j) 2D greyscale diagram of marginal cord insertion progression to furcate cord insertion showed small and separated (Figure d asterisks, Figure g arrow) or branched (Figure j arrow) umbilical vessels before entering the placental parenchyma, with partial umbilical vessel branches traveling through the amniotic membranes (Figure c black arrow); h, k) Energy Doppler of furcate cord insertion in the second trimester; e, l) Gross specimens with furcate cord insertion showed separation or branching of the umbilical cord trunk before entering the placenta parenchyma, and the umbilical vessel branches were not wrapped by Wharton's jelly, confirming furcate cord insertion.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uDYAV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Literature screening was conducted strictly according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each eligible study, information such as authors, study period, country, study type, sample size, age, data source, and adjusted confounding factors was extracted. Two researchers independently performed the literature screening, initially reviewing titles and abstracts for preliminary selection, followed by a thorough reading of the full texts to exclude studies that did not meet the criteria. Ultimately, the two researchers verified the selected studies against each other. In cases of disagreement, discussions were held to reach a consensus; if consensus could not be achieved, a third-party researcher was consulted for final evaluation regarding the inclusion of the study.

The quality of the included observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). This scale evaluates studies based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and outcome, with a scoring range of 0–9 points. Specific assessment criteria included: selection (representativeness of the study population, adequacy of sample size, confirmation of exposure factors, etc), comparability (selection of control groups, control of confounding factors, etc), and outcome (methods of outcome assessment, completeness of follow-up, etc). Based on the scores, studies were categorized as high quality (7–9 points), moderate quality (4–6 points), or low quality (0–3 points).

### Prediction of fetal acidemia in placental abruption [^113kvnnx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in the present study. First, this study was conducted in a retrospective fashion; therefore, further study is warranted to prove the usefulness of this score prospectively. Second, as a severe abruption score is based only on cases where a diagnosis of abruption was confirmed according to placental appearance just after delivery and is designed to be used immediately after delivery, this score should be used with caution. Finally, it is important to understand that this score is influenced by the sample size. The prognosis of the babies born following placental abruption will be reported separately.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^114Vkjri]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Placental abruption, defined as premature separation of a normally implanted placenta prior to delivery, results from the culmination of underlying pathophysiologic processes. These processes may either be initiated by a single precipitating event, such as premature rupture of membranes, or more commonly, associated with chronic uteroplacental vascular insufficiency, such as chronic hypertension. Placental abruption complicates 0.8 to 1.0% of pregnancies, and the incidence appears to be increasing. Furthermore, histologic evidence of decidual hemorrhage has been noted in 2 to 4% of deliveries, even though most cases are not associated with clinical diagnoses of abruption.

Placental abruption, especially marginal or peripheral placental abruption, has also been associated with preterm labor. The incidence of abruption peaks at 24 to 26 weeks of gestation. Furthermore, histologic evidence of old hemorrhage was demonstrated in the placentas of over 50% of women with preterm birth (PTB) in one analysis. Interestingly, there appears to be evidence for heterogeneity in the clinical pathways of placental abruption in term and preterm gestations, with acute inflammation being more prevalent at preterm than term gestations, and chronic processes present throughout gestation.

Risk factors associated with placental abruption include:

- **Previous abruption**: This is the strongest risk factor.
- **Mechanical factors**: These comprise trauma and other physical impacts.
- **Chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension**: Both contribute significantly to risk.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Cigarette smoking and cocaine use are notable risk factors.
- **Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM)**: This condition is a significant contributor.
- **Reproductive history**: Multiparity and multiple gestations increase risk.
- **Advanced maternal age**: Poses additional risk factors.

These factors contribute to the complex etiology of placental abruption.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: A case report and literature review [^112s2vmp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

Uterine torsion is a rare obstetric event that can occur during pregnancy and is difficult to diagnose. Its occurrence may lead to serious adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Case introduction**: The patient was a 33-year-old woman at 30 +5 weeks' gestation with a singleton pregnancy. The pregnancy course, including fetal growth and prenatal examinations, was regular. Except for a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and treatment with progesterone, there were no prenatal abnormalities, and the patient denied any trauma or sexual history. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen and slight vaginal bleeding during night sleep. Abdominal pain started two hours prior to admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Examination revealed positive abdominal tenderness, high uterine tone, and no significant intermittent period of uterine contractions. Measurement of the fetal heart rate by means of the nonstress test revealed a rate of 60 beats per minute, therefore, placental abruption was highly suspected. Subsequently, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. The newborn boy, with Apgar scores of 0–3–4 after birth and weighing 1880g, was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and died two days later due to ineffective rescue. After the uterine incision was sutured, examination revealed that the uterine incision was located on the posterior wall of the uterus, and the uterus was twisted 180° to the right. The diagnosis after cesarean.

### Pregnancy outcomes after assisted human reproduction [^1119Mwki]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

### Placental abruption [^112kuoTr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Placental abruption complicates about 1% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of vaginal bleeding in the latter half of pregnancy. It is also an important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The maternal effect of abruption depends primarily on its severity, whereas its effect on the fetus is determined both by its severity and the gestational age at which it occurs.

Risk factors for abruption include prior abruption, smoking, trauma, cocaine use, multifetal gestation, hypertension, preeclampsia, thrombophilias, advanced maternal age, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, intrauterine infections, and hydramnios. Abruption involving more than 50% of the placenta is frequently associated with fetal death. The diagnosis of abruption is a clinical one; ultrasonography and the Kleihauer-Betke test are of limited value.

The management of abruption should be individualized based on the severity of the abruption and the gestational age at which it occurs. In cases where fetal demise has occurred, vaginal delivery is preferable. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy should be managed aggressively.

When abruption occurs at or near term and maternal and fetal status are reassuring, conservative management with the goal of vaginal delivery may be reasonable. However, in the presence of fetal or maternal compromise, prompt delivery by cesarean is often indicated. Similarly, abruption at extremely preterm gestations may be managed conservatively in selected stable cases, with close monitoring and rapid delivery should deterioration occur.

### Can placental pathology explain second-trimester pregnancy loss and subsequent pregnancy outcomes [^111UEGgF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether specific placental pathology may provide further insight into the mechanisms of second-trimester pregnancy loss, particularly in cases without inflammation.

- **Study design**: A blinded pathologist examined placentas from 90 patients with spontaneous second-trimester pregnancy loss and 17 controls who presented for induction of labor for fetal indications. Inflammation was staged and evidence of other vascular pathology recorded. Significant associations were determined by chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test. A secondary analysis examined losses without inflammation. Twelve patients with a subsequent pregnancy were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Acute inflammation was more prevalent in cases than controls (P < .001). Sixty-seven percent of all cases and none of the controls showed a stage 2–3 inflammatory response. Histologic abruption was also more prevalent in cases than controls (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Second-trimester pregnancy loss is strongly associated with placental inflammation. Histologic abruption is likely another etiology. Future research should focus on subsequent pregnancy outcomes in these women based on initial placental pathology to help determine etiology and recurrence risk.

### First trimester prediction of ischemic placental disease [^1151nxRh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Ischemic placental disease is characterized by one or more clinical manifestations: preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and/or placental abruption, resulting in indicated preterm delivery. Since over half of the indicated preterm deliveries are due to ischemic placental disease, accurate early prediction of the disease is of paramount importance in developing prevention strategies. This review article focuses on studies that have used the first trimester aneuploidy screening timing window to predict patients who later develop ischemic placental disease. Emphasis was given to studies originating from the Fetal Medicine Foundation because of their uniformity in definitions and the expertise of personnel who performed the ultrasound screening exams.

### The role of maternal homocysteine concentration in placenta-mediated complications: Findings from the Ottawa and Kingston birth cohort [^111PLYZz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Homocysteine is an intermediate metabolite implicated in the risk of placenta-mediated complications, including preeclampsia, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and pregnancy loss. Large cohort and case-control studies have reported inconsistent associations between homocysteine and these complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether elevated maternal plasma homocysteine concentration in the early to mid-second trimester is associated with an increased risk of placenta-mediated complications. We examined the following potential moderating factors that may explain discrepancies among previous studies: high-risk pregnancy and the MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from participants recruited to the Ottawa and Kingston (OaK) Birth Cohort from 2002 to 2009 in Ottawa and Kingston, Canada. The primary outcome was a composite of any placenta-mediated complication, defined as a composite of small for gestational age (SGA) infant, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and pregnancy loss. Secondary outcomes were, individually: SGA infant, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and pregnancy loss. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses with homocysteine as the primary continuous exposure, adjusting for gestational age at the time of bloodwork and explanatory maternal characteristics. The functional form, i.e. the shape of the homocysteine association with the outcome was examined using restricted cubic splines and information criteria (Akaike's/Bayesian Information Criterion statistics).

### Placental vascular pathology as a mechanism of disease in pregnancy complications [^111Jas3a]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Inadequate placental development results in pregnancy complications. The extent and degree of defective deep placentation may explain why a similar insult results in different clinical presentations. The relatively new categorization of placental lesions, which separates non-infectious lesions into those consistent with maternal and fetal circulation abnormalities and infectious lesions into maternal and fetal inflammatory responses, provides an additional tool to determine the placental maternal and fetal roles in various pregnancy complications.

Placental vascular lesions differ in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (predominant maternal vascular supply lesions), by fetal growth restriction (FGR) (predominant fetal vascular supply lesions), and by preeclampsia with FGR (both maternal and fetal compartments are involved). Moreover, placental vascular lesions also differ in relation to gestational age at disease onset, as observed in early- and late-onset preeclampsia, FGR, fetal death, and preterm labor.

### Severe placental abruption: Clinical definition and associations with maternal complications [^113gwZxS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is traditionally defined as the premature separation of the implanted placenta before the delivery of the fetus. The existing clinical criteria of severity rely exclusively on fetal (fetal distress or fetal death) and maternal complications without consideration of neonatal or preterm delivery-related complications. However, two-thirds of abruption cases are accompanied by fetal or neonatal complications, including preterm delivery. A clinically meaningful classification for abruption, therefore, should include not only maternal complications but also adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes, such as intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to define severe placental abruption and to compare serious maternal morbidity profiles of such cases with all other cases of abruption (i.e. mild abruption) and non-abruption cases.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using the Premier database of hospitalizations that resulted in singleton births in the United States between 2006 and 2012 (n = 27,796,465). Severe abruption was defined as abruption accompanied by at least one of the following events: maternal (disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypovolemic shock, blood transfusion, hysterectomy, renal failure, or in-hospital death), fetal (non-reassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal death), or neonatal (neonatal death, preterm delivery or small for gestational age) complications. Abruption cases that did not qualify as being severe were classified as mild.

### Placental abruption and neonatal anemia [^117BkiyR]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

Placental abruption can cause maternal blood loss and maternal anemia. It is less certain whether abruption can cause fetal blood loss and neonatal anemia.

- **Study design**: Retrospective multi-hospital 24-month analysis of women with placental abruption and their neonates.

- **Results**: Of 55,111 births, 678 (1.2%) had confirmed abruption; 83% of these neonates (564) had one or more hemoglobins recorded in the first day. Four hundred seventy (83.3%) had a normal hemoglobin (≥ 5th% reference interval) while 94 (16.7%) had anemia, relative risk 3.26 (95% CI, 2.66–4.01) vs. > 360,000 neonates from previous reference interval reports. The relative risk of severe anemia (< 1st% interval) was 4.96 (3.44–7.16). When the obstetrician identified the abruption as "small" or "marginal", the risk of anemia was insignificant.

- **Conclusions**: Most abruptions do not cause neonatal anemia, but approximately 16% do. If an abruption is not documented as small, it is important to surveille the neonate for anemia.

### Placental abruption in term and preterm gestations: Evidence for heterogeneity in clinical pathways [^117K7aLm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

To estimate the magnitude of associations of acute and chronic processes with abruption in preterm and term gestations, a retrospective cohort study was performed using data on women who delivered singleton live births and stillbirths at 20 or more weeks of gestation in the United States between 1995 and 2002 (n = 30,378,902).

- **Methods**: Rates of 1) acute-inflammation-associated clinical conditions (premature rupture of membranes and intrauterine infection); 2) chronic processes associated with vascular dysfunction or chronic inflammation (chronic and pregnancy-induced hypertension, preexisting or gestational diabetes, small for gestational age, and maternal smoking); and 3) both acute and chronic processes, were examined among women with and without abruption. Rates were examined separately among preterm (< 37 weeks) and term births, with adjustment for confounders. Relative risk (RR) for aforementioned groups in relation to abruption was derived from multivariate logistic regression models after adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: At preterm gestation, the rates of acute-inflammation-associated conditions were higher among women with than without abruption (12.0% compared with 10.2%; RR 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–1.42). At term, acute-inflammation-associated conditions were present in 4.2% and 3.3% of births with and without abruption, respectively (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.33–1.45). At preterm gestation, the rates of chronic processes were 43.9% and 30.0% among women with and without abruption, respectively (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.85–1.90).

### Maternal, labor, delivery, and perinatal outcomes associated with placental abruption: A systematic review [^1114iZaa]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). High credibility.

The risk factors for placental abruption have evolved, yet there has not been an updated systematic review exploring outcomes. We conducted searches in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL for publications from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016. Our review focused on English-language publications reporting the estimated incidence and/or risk factors for maternal, labor, delivery, and perinatal outcomes linked to abruption. Studies excluded were case studies, conference abstracts, and those lacking a referent/comparison group or a clear characterization of placental abruption.

A total of 123 studies were included. Findings indicated that abruption was associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage and transfusion, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction or low birth weight, perinatal mortality, and cerebral palsy. Additional maternal outcomes included relaparotomy, hysterectomy, sepsis, amniotic fluid embolism, venous thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, and maternal intensive care unit admission. Perinatal outcomes extended to acidosis, encephalopathy, severe respiratory disorders, necrotizing enterocolitis, acute kidney injury, need for resuscitation, chronic lung disease, infant death, and epilepsy.

Few studies examined outcomes beyond the initial birth period, but there is evidence that both mother and child are at risk of further adverse outcomes. There was also considerable variation in, or absence of, the reporting of abruption definitions.

### Frequency, risk factors and feto-maternal outcomes of abruptio placentae in Northern Tanzania: a registry-based retrospective cohort study [^112a6pYs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The second important finding of our study pertains to the association between previous caesarean delivery and an increased risk of abruptio placentae. The risk of abruptio placentae increased nearly twofold for women with prior caesarean section delivery. A similar observation was reported elsewhere, but in our study, this risk was lower than the seven- and tenfold increases reported by Wandabwa et al. and Nayama et al. The increased risk of abruption among women with prior caesarean delivery may imply that these women had a ruptured scar from the previous caesarean. The differences in the risk of abruptio placentae between our study and those of others may be explained by the differences in pre-existing conditions associated with abruptio placentae between the studied populations.

Our study confirmed that abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy is an important risk factor for its occurrence in subsequent pregnancies. This observation aligns with previous reports. An association between prior abruptio placentae and its recurrence in subsequent pregnancies was demonstrated by Rasmussen and colleagues in a Norwegian cohort, where they reported a fivefold increase in the relative recurrence risk of abruptio placentae. This indicates that more persistent risk factors, such as preeclampsia and chronic hypertension, may play a role.

In the present study, the occurrence of abruptio placentae was higher in women with high parity and multigravid status compared to nulliparous or primigravid women. These results are in line with many previous studies but contrast with findings from other research.
