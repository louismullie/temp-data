## Question

What are the typical radiographic findings in pulmonary histoplasmosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical radiographic findings in pulmonary histoplasmosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how immune status and exposure inoculum shape imaging. Then, I should categorize the major radiographic syndromes of histoplasmosis. Next, I will detail the key imaging patterns for each syndrome, including chest radiography and CT features. After that, I should consider special populations and mimics that confound diagnosis. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic approach and summarize the most characteristic findings with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because radiographic patterns hinge on host immunity and exposure intensity. Immunocompetent hosts often show focal or nodular disease with calcification, whereas immunocompromised patients, especially those with advanced HIV, are prone to diffuse interstitial or alveolar infiltrates and dissemination; heavy exposures can produce severe acute pulmonary disease with diffuse opacities and lymphadenopathy, so I need to keep these axes in mind as I interpret films [^1139DzwE] [^114xusR4] [^117NUnC9].

> I will now examine the major radiographic syndromes to anchor the discussion. Wait, let me verify the canonical categories: acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis, mediastinal complications including granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis, and calcified pulmonary nodules or histoplasmomas; these align with contemporary radiology and infectious disease summaries and will guide the pattern-based review [^1139DzwE] [^116w7sTN].

> For acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, I should confirm the typical chest radiograph features. In immunocompetent hosts with mild disease, small focal infiltrates and hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy are common, whereas heavy inoculum exposures can show diffuse interstitial or alveolar opacities with prominent lymphadenopathy; CT often reveals centrilobular micronodules and a tree-in-bud pattern with ground-glass opacities, reflecting endobronchial spread and granulomatous inflammation, and I need to remember that the reversed halo sign, while not pathognomonic, has been reported in histoplasmosis and can support a granulomatous process when present [^114xusR4] [^117NUnC9] [^113UbVcB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic cavitary disease. I should double-check the predilection for upper lobes and the imaging hallmarks. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis tends to involve the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes, with thin-walled cavities, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and volume loss; these findings often mimic tuberculosis, so I need to correlate with exposure risk and mycologic testing rather than assuming TB solely based on cavitary upper lobe disease [^115ddHsE] [^1139DzwE].

> Next, I should review mediastinal complications. Mediastinal granulomas from healed histoplasmosis typically appear as calcified nodes, whereas fibrosing mediastinitis manifests as a noncalcified infiltrative mediastinal soft-tissue mass that encases and compresses vessels and airways; on FDG-PET, activity can vary with disease activity, which can help distinguish active inflammatory from chronic fibrotic phases when planning interventions, and I need to ensure I consider broncholithiasis from eroded calcified nodes causing obstruction as a related sequela [^1146jqHR] [^112TNWxU] [^111PmAr9].

> Let me consider calcified pulmonary nodules, the so-called histoplasmomas. These are usually 1–4 cm, well-circumscribed, and often calcified, frequently in the lower lobes; they represent granulomatous scars from prior infection and are typically stable over time, though I should confirm stability with serial imaging when malignancy is a concern, especially in endemic regions where granulomatous disease is prevalent [^115ddHsE] [^1139DzwE].

> I need to check special populations and mimics that can confound interpretation. In children, airway compromise from mediastinal lymphadenopathy is more common due to greater airway pliability, and disseminated disease may present with interstitial pneumonitis and hepatosplenomegaly; in immunocompromised hosts, diffuse micronodules, consolidations, and miliary patterns are more likely, and the chest radiograph can even be normal early in severe disease, so a normal film does not exclude histoplasmosis when pretest probability is high; importantly, PET-avid granulomas can mimic malignancy, so I should avoid overcalling cancer in endemic settings without tissue confirmation [^116tdZ9R] [^113dwjej] [^113RSDSm] [^1141A15s].

> But wait, what if the imaging shows a solitary pulmonary nodule or a cavitary lesion — how do I proceed diagnostically? I should confirm exposure risk, obtain Histoplasma antigen and serology recognizing that antigen is more sensitive in acute and disseminated disease while serology performs better in immunocompetent pulmonary disease, and consider CT-guided biopsy when malignancy cannot be reasonably excluded; in endemic areas, many nodules are granulomatous and benign, so observation with interval imaging is often appropriate when risk of malignancy is low and the clinical picture is compatible [^114Jde3Y] [^115zTx8A] [^1141A15s] [^114zL4pi].

> Let me synthesize the most characteristic radiographic findings while keeping the caveats explicit. Typical features include small focal infiltrates with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy in acute disease, centrilobular micronodules and tree-in-bud with ground-glass on CT, upper lobe thin-walled cavities with fibrosis in chronic disease, calcified mediastinal nodes or a constricting mediastinal mass in fibrosing mediastinitis, and stable calcified pulmonary nodules as residua; however, these patterns overlap with TB, sarcoidosis, and malignancy, so I should integrate exposure, immune status, and mycologic testing rather than relying on imaging alone [^1139DzwE] [^117NUnC9] [^1146jqHR] [^115ddHsE].

Pulmonary histoplasmosis shows a **broad radiographic spectrum** that varies with immune status and disease chronicity [^1139DzwE]. In immunocompetent hosts, the most common findings are **single or multiple pulmonary nodules** (often calcified), **hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy**, and **patchy bronchopneumonic infiltrates** [^1139DzwE]; these typically resolve or calcify, leaving granulomas or histoplasmomas [^115ddHsE]. In immunocompromised patients, imaging more often reveals **diffuse reticulonodular or miliary micronodules**, **consolidations**, and **progressive cavitation**, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions also seen [^117NUnC9]. Chronic disease may show upper-lobe fibrocavitary changes mimicking tuberculosis [^115ddHsE]. CT better defines **micronodules**, **tree-in-bud opacities**, **cavitation**, and **mediastinal disease**, including fibrosing mediastinitis [^117NUnC9] [^1146jqHR].

## Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis

### Immunocompetent hosts

- **Pulmonary nodules**: Single or multiple, often 1–4 cm, well-circumscribed, and frequently calcified; these are classic residua of granulomatous inflammation [^115ddHsE].

- **Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy**: Commonly enlarged, often calcified on follow-up; this is a hallmark of primary infection [^114xusR4].

- **Patchy bronchopneumonic infiltrates**: Focal or segmental consolidations that can mimic bacterial pneumonia [^1139DzwE].

- **Pleural effusions**: Occasionally present, usually small and self-limited [^notfound].

---

### Immunocompromised hosts

- **Diffuse reticulonodular or miliary micronodules**: Reflect hematogenous dissemination and are more pronounced on CT [^117NUnC9].

- **Consolidations**: Patchy or diffuse, often progressive and bilateral [^notfound].

- **Cavitation**: More frequent and extensive than in immunocompetent hosts, sometimes with air-fluid levels [^notfound].

- **Mediastinal lymphadenopathy**: Prominent and often noncalcified in active disease [^notfound].

---

## Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis

Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis is characterized by **upper-lobe fibrocavitary disease** with apical-posterior predominance, bronchiectasis, and fibrosis; these changes can resemble tuberculosis and reflect repeated infections superimposed on structural lung damage [^115ddHsE] [^1139DzwE].

---

## Mediastinal complications

Mediastinal granulomas are **calcified lymph nodes** that may cause bronchial compression or obstruction, whereas fibrosing mediastinitis presents as a dense, infiltrative mediastinal mass that compresses mediastinal structures — including the superior vena cava, pulmonary vessels, and airways — and may show variable FDG uptake on PET depending on activity [^1146jqHR] [^112TNWxU].

---

## Advanced imaging modalities

CT provides **superior delineation** of small nodules, micronodules, tree-in-bud opacities, cavitation, and mediastinal disease, including fibrosing mediastinitis [^117NUnC9] [^1146jqHR]. PET-CT can show variable FDG uptake in active granulomatous disease but is nonspecific and may mimic malignancy, limiting its utility for differentiation [^113RSDSm] [^1141A15s].

## Summary of radiographic findings

| **Radiographic finding** | **Immunocompetent hosts** | **Immunocompromised hosts** |
|-|-|-|
| Pulmonary nodules | Common, often calcified | Less common, noncalcified |
| Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy | Common, often calcified | Common, noncalcified |
| Patchy infiltrates | Common | Common |
| Pleural effusion | Rare | Occasional |
| Cavitation | Rare | Common |
| Miliary nodules | Rare | Common |
| Fibrocavitary disease | Rare | Common |

Pulmonary histoplasmosis has a **broad radiographic spectrum** that reflects host immunity and disease chronicity, with immunocompetent patients more often showing calcified nodules and lymphadenopathy, while immunocompromised patients more often have diffuse micronodules, consolidations, and cavitation; CT enhances detection of small lesions and mediastinal complications, and PET-CT has limited specificity for distinguishing granulomatous disease from malignancy [^1139DzwE] [^117NUnC9] [^113RSDSm].

### Histoplasmosis [^116caTAw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although histoplasmosis is highly endemic in certain regions of the Americas, disease may be seen globally and should not be overlooked in patients with unexplained pulmonary or systemic illnesses. Most patients exhibit pulmonary signs and symptoms, accompanied by radiographic abnormalities, which often are mistaken for community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacterial or viral agents. Once a diagnosis is considered, a panel of mycologic and non-culture-based assays is adequate to establish a diagnosis in a few days to a week in most patients. Once diagnosed, the treatment is highly effective even in immunocompromised patients.

### Improved diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis by combining antigen and antibody detection [^114xusR4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis following heavy exposure is characterized by systemic and respiratory symptoms typically beginning 5 days to 3 weeks following exposure. Chest radiograph and/or computed tomographic scanning typically show diffuse interstitial and/or alveolar infiltrates, usually accompanied by hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The illness is often severe, and sometimes fatal.

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is often suspected when multiple individuals present with similar clinical findings following a common activity involving disturbance of a site contaminated with bird or bat guano. However, diagnosis becomes more complicated if the exposed individuals disperse and are unaware that others have similar illness, if a single individual is exposed, or if the individual was not directly involved in the activity that led to exposure. Once suspected, the diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis can usually be established promptly by detection of antigen in the urine or serum. In one study, antigen was present in 83% of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis cases, but 38% would have been missed if only urine was tested. An antibody assay could assist in the diagnosis of cases with negative antigen results, especially those with mild to moderate disease.

### North American endemic fungal infections [^1139DzwE]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis are endemic fungal infections in North America. Many infections are subclinical, and many symptomatic infections are mild. Pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation. All can occur in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the latter at greater risk for disseminated and more severe disease. As with other acute respiratory illness, imaging can play a role in diagnosis. Knowledge of the acute and chronic imaging findings of endemic fungal infections is important for radiologists so that they can assist in establishing these often-elusive diagnoses, recognize normal evolution of imaging findings of infection, and identify complications.

### Pulmonary fungal infection: imaging findings in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients [^112nfNGL]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis in North America, and is followed by coccidioidomycosis and blastomycosis. Although the majority of these infections in immunocompetent persons are self-limited, some patients can develop severe pneumonitis or various forms of chronic pulmonary infection. Cryptococcoci, Aspergillus, Candidas, and Mucorals are ubiquitous organisms, which may affect immunocompromised patients. Specific imaging findings can be expected, depending on the organisms involved, underlying patients' conditions (immune status), and specific situations after immune depleting procedures.

Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis — severity definitions for clinical decision support: Asymptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis is asymptomatic but has evidence of recent onset or active infection. Mild acute pulmonary histoplasmosis has mild symptoms that do not interfere with normal activities. Moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis has symptoms significant enough to interfere with normal activities and may require low-flow oxygen supplementation or hospitalization. Severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis includes respiratory failure requiring substantial supplemental oxygen, significant weight loss and/or malaise, and requires hospitalization with possible intensive care. These definitions are intended as guidance; clinical assessment should drive care decisions.

Discussion

H. capsulatum is endemic to many parts of the world, in particular Latin America and the areas of the Midwestern and Southcentral United States. It is found to prefer moist soil as a habitat, mainly that contaminated by droppings of birds and bats. The pathogenesis of histoplasmosis infection starts with the disruption of the soil. As a result, the hyphae and conidia of H. capsulatum become aerosolized, inhaled and deposited into the lung. There, the fungus is engulfed by macrophages and other phagosomes, but eludes elimination by converting to the yeast form. The yeast cells then reside and multiply within the phagolysosomal vesicles, possibly through a mechanism that elevates intraphagosomal pH. In the absence of cell mediated immunity (CMI), the yeasts continue to multiply and disseminate to involve organs of the reticulo-endothelial system. Once CMI develops, in the immunocompetent adult, the formation of a granuloma begins and the intracellular yeasts are finally destroyed.

The clinical presentation of acute histoplasmosis usually depends on the size of the inoculum and the immune response of the host. The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic or present as an influenza-like illness, with cough, fever, and headache. Chest radiographic findings typically demonstrate small areas of infiltrate or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. With time, a granulomatous reaction occurs with areas of caseating necrosis leading to the appearance of a round mass of scar tissue that may or may not be calcified, known as a histoplasmoma.

In patients with known underlying lung disease, such as emphysema or COPD, a chronic form of pulmonary histoplasmosis may occur. This infection usually starts by the colonization of diseased lung tissue in the upper zones, and progresses gradually, leading to cavity formation and scarring. Symptoms are characterized by a productive cough, fever, hemoptysis, weight loss, and occasional night sweats along with lung cavitations that may be seen on chest radiographs, often mimicking tuberculosis.

Histoplasmosis — antigen and serology testing guidance. We recommend the use of Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum for rapid diagnosis of suspected disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis when timely diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance to outcome (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We suggest the use of Histoplasma serologies in immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis. Adding Histoplasma antigen to serological testing might improve the diagnostic yield (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Histoplasmosis is one of the most frequent causes of fungal respiratory infection in endemic regions; it has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and can present in several forms. It is highly endemic in regions of Central and South America, as well as being reported in parts of Asia and Africa. The risk of histoplasmosis is greatest in patients with severely impaired cellular immunity, especially those with HIV and CD4 + counts of < 150 cells/μL. A direct correlation exists between the CD4 + T-cell count and the capacity of macrophages to bind yeast cells. CD4 + cells are very important in controlling primary infection. Infected macrophages induce granuloma formation. However, macrophages from HIV-infected individuals do not mount an effective immune response, and reactivation of latent organisms is considered by some to be the common mode of infection in immunocompromised patients. Pulmonary histoplasmosis is a common manifestation of Histoplasma infection, with features similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis; if it remains undiagnosed or untreated, it can also cause significant morbidity and mortality. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for moderate to severe and disseminated presentations, whereas itraconazole is appropriate for mild disease and as step-down therapy.

### Histoplasmosis in children [^113dwjej]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Histoplamosis is the most common primary systemic mycosis in the USA and is becoming more common as an opportunistic infection in HIV patients worldwide. In children the rate of asymptomatic infection is high. However, in infants with an immature immunological system, disseminated disease may occur. The clinical picture is variable depending on the immunological status. At the onset of the infection clinical manifestations are non specific (headache, fever, cough and nausea). Usually, these symptoms are self-limited and improve without treatment. However, patients with disseminated diseases present with prolonged fever, malaise, cough and weight loss. Hepatosplenomegaly is frequent in infants. Chest radiographs may be normal in 40 to 50% of patients with disseminated disease but findings such as lobar or diffuse infiltrates, cavitations, hilar adenopathy, or any combination of these may be found. Frequently, the clinical presentation is misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Skin tests, serological reaction and specific cultures are used for diagnosis confirmation. Treatment indications and regimens are similar to those for adults, except that amphotericin B deoxycholate is usually well tolerated in children.

### Histoplasmosis [^113uwkAq]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic fungal infection in North America. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic, self-limited illness to a life-threatening progressive disseminated disease. Chronic manifestations of healed infection can also be problematic. Clinical presentation depends on the infectious load, underlying immune status, and lung function. The preferred diagnostic methods and treatment options vary with clinical scenario and severity of illness. New diagnostic tools and treatment options are now available in clinical practice. We present an overview of this important endemic mycosis with emphasis on diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the different clinical syndromes of histoplasmosis.

### Transformation of pulmonary histoplasmosis to sarcoidosis: a case report [^113vo3we]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis, a dimorphic fungus, and sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown etiology, share many clinical features, including typical manifestations of granulomatous inflammation involving the lungs and mediastinal lymphatics in association with constitutional symptoms. As such, they are often difficult to distinguish based upon clinical presentation. Recent studies suggest that sarcoidosis may be triggered by infectious agents. Here we present a case of documented pulmonary histoplasmosis that evolved into sarcoidosis. This case supports the notion that infections promote sarcoidosis in predisposed hosts.

A 70-year-old man, ex-smoker with a 3-pack-year smoking history, presented with a 5-week history of persistent cough. There were no positive findings on clinical examination. The patient's chest X-ray showed a nodular density in the right lung, initially thought to be malignant. After an extensive workup which included CT-guided lung biopsies, bronchoscopies, positron emission tomography scanning, among many other investigations, discussion at the respiratory multidisciplinary team meeting, and a right upper lobe lung resection, a diagnosis of histoplasmosis was performed.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114J1pT5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic mycosis in North America. With the continually expanding at-risk population and widening areas of endemicity, the need to better understand the optimal diagnostic methods for histoplasmosis is pressing. The mortality in histoplasmosis is estimated to be 5% in children and 8% in adults. Fungal cultures are the gold standard test to confirm the diagnosis. However, they can be technically challenging and are time consuming. Rapid diagnosis is essential in patients with severe infections such as disseminated and severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis to allow for early initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy, potentially improving outcomes.

Antigen and antibody detection are currently the most widely accepted non–culture-based methods to diagnose histoplasmosis. Their diagnostic yields depend on the clinical presentations, infectious burden, immune status, and timing in relation to the infection. The laboratory methods used to detect Histoplasma antigen and antibodies have been updated in the last decade to include quantitative methods and lower thresholds of detection that have improved their sensitivity and allowed for comparison of titers and monitoring response to treatment. Cross-reactivity with other endemic fungal pathogens is problematic. Histoplasma antigen was studied mostly in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis, whereas studies of antibodies examined patients with predominantly pulmonary histoplasmosis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116tdZ9R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations — HIV-infected children with AIDS most often present with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), which is fatal if untreated, with prolonged fever and failure to thrive as uniform presenting complaints; reported signs and symptoms in children with PDH complicating AIDS are similar to those seen in PDH in otherwise normal infants and in infections in patients with other primary or acquired immunodeficiencies, including splenomegaly, cough, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, septic appearance, generalized lymphadenopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, cytopenia(s), coagulopathy, oropharyngeal/gastrointestinal ulcerations, and erythematous nodular/ulcerative cutaneous lesions. In HIV-uninfected children, acute pulmonary manifestations are common and chronic pulmonary infections have not been described, airway obstruction from mediastinal lymphadenopathy is more common in children because of greater airway pliability, meningitis often accompanies progressive disseminated infection in infancy, subacute meningitis and parenchymal lesions characteristic of central nervous system disease in adults are unusual in children, and isolated pulmonary granulomas from past infection are common incidental findings in chest radiographs of asymptomatic persons who have resided in histoplasmosis-endemic regions.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas) — antifungal therapy initiation: In adults and children with asymptomatic noncalcified pulmonary nodules related to histoplasmosis with no evidence of other active sites, or asymptomatic patients with known untreated prior infection, the panel suggests against routinely providing antifungal treatment for histoplasmomas to prevent reactivation (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients with only calcified pulmonary nodules should not be treated. For pregnant individuals, treatment should only be considered after carefully weighing benefits versus harms with specialist input; if treatment is necessary, azoles should be avoided in the first trimester when possible and liposomal amphotericin B used instead.

DISCUSSION

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, later becoming a pandemic. Brazil experienced a significant rise in the number of patients with severe acute respiratory illness in the first 12 epidemiological weeks of 2020, higher than that in the past 10 years, which is attributed to be due to the new COVID-19 infection. The first COVID-19 Brazilian case was confirmed on February 25, 2020. Classically, COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and headache, but many patients could be asymptomatic.

Computed tomography and 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT findings in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection have been described in different reports. – Multiple areas in both lungs could present ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving patterns, consolidations, or linear opacities. Air bronchogram, bronchiectasis, and pleural effusion are less frequent. The opacities tend to occur mainly in peripheral regions in both lungs, mainly in the lower lobe. These abnormalities do not reflect active inflammation, because it could persist a long time after the resolution of the symptoms.

### Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis with concomitant disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in a patient with AIDS from a nonendemic region (California) [^116yELdL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Opportunistic infections, while well studied in the AIDS population, continue to have variable and surprising presentations. Here, we present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in a 50 year old man with long standing AIDS living in a non-endemic area.

Case presentation

Patient presented with a constellation of symptoms, and imaging of the chest showed a pulmonary mass with cavitation, multiple nodules, and ground glass opacities. Further investigations revealed granulomatous lung nodules and fungemia consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, and coinfection with disseminated nontuberculous mycobateria in a nonendemic area.

Conclusions

Immunocompromised patients risk co-inhabitation by multiple infectious organisms. Some of these organisms may preside in the host for years prior to reactivation. Clinicians in non endemic areas should therefore be careful to not overlook specific organisms based on a lack of a recent travel history. Physicians in nonendemic areas should become more familiar with the clinical findings and diagnostic approach of infectious such as Histoplasmosis, to ensure earlier recognition and treatment in immunocompromised individuals.

### Clinical overview of histoplasmosis… [^116w7sTN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Common symptoms of histoplasmosis include fever, cough, and malaise and are typically self-limiting.
- Chronic disseminated and severe cases require antifungals. Histoplasmaantigen detection in urine and/or serum is one of the most sensitive diagnostic methods.
- Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome may be a long-term complication.
- Refer to CDC's algorithm to guide diagnosis and treatment. Clinical features Symptoms and severity Severity of illness depends on host immunity and intensity of exposure. Symptomatic infections usually present 3 to 17 days after exposure. Symptoms of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis include fever, malaise, cough, headache, chest pain, chills, and myalgias. Persons with a history of pulmonary disease can develop chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Immunosuppressed persons are at risk for developing disseminated histoplasmosis.

Sequelae Sequelae can include pericarditis, broncholithiasis, pulmonary nodules, mediastinal granuloma, or mediastinal fibrosis. In persons who develop progressive, chronic, or disseminated disease, symptoms may persist for months or longer. Mortality is high in people living with HIV who develop disseminated histoplasmosis. Can be performed on tissue, blood, and other body fluids, but may take up to 6 weeks to become positive; most useful in the diagnosis of the severe forms of histoplasmosis. A commercially available DNA probe can be used to confirm. For detection of budding yeast in tissue or body fluids. It has low sensitivity but can provide a quick proven diagnosis if positive. PCR for detection of Histoplasma directly from clinical specimens is not widely available; however, it can be performed on serum, tissue, or BAL fluid and is promising.

Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome, a condition that can cause vision loss, is being studied as a long-term complication of histoplasmosis. The clinical manifestations of POHS include:

- "Punched out" round chorioretinal scars
- Peripapillary atrophy
- Absence of vitritis
- Choroidal neovascularization.

### Pulmonary nodule tracking using chest computed tomography in a histoplasmosis endemic area [^114zL4pi]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In areas with endemic histoplasmosis, incidental pulmonary nodules are common. Rate of malignancy and applicability of current tracking guidelines in these regions remain unclear.

Methods

A total of 148 cases of incidental pulmonary nodules tracked with chest computed tomography were reviewed for radiologic characteristics, diagnosis, number, and size.

Results

Of the nodules, 87.8% were benign and 12.2% malignant; 30% of nodules > 20mm were malignant. Number of nodules (P = 0.14) and granulomatous disease (P = 0.71) were not related to malignant diagnosis.

Conclusion

Malignancy was lower than expected in nodules > 20mm. Appropriate tracking guidelines for incidentally discovered nodules in histoplasmosis endemic regions must be determined.

### Delivering on antimicrobial resistance agenda not possible without improving fungal diagnostic capabilities [^114usx8S]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Weight loss, worsening cough, chest pains, dyspnea, and fatigue are common manifestations of TB and CPA, and abnormalities seen on chest radiographs are similar for the 2 diseases (Figure 1). In studies from the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Korea, Iran, and India, the frequency of elevated serum levels of Aspergillus antibody after TB varied upwards from 20%. Aspergillus antibody detection is the key diagnostic test for CPA; the test has 96%–97% sensitivity and 92%–98% specificity. Given that CPA is a common sequela to TB and has a 5-year death rate of 75%–80%, it needs to be sought actively by Aspergillus antibody testing in symptomatic patients who have completed antituberculous therapy. A study from Iran showed that serum samples from almost all patients thought to have recurrent TB were positive for Aspergillus antibody. In Brazil and Uganda, Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA was identified in the sputum of up to 7.0% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, diagnosed with smear-negative TB. This finding and the recognition of patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis (Figure 2) or coccidioidomycosis indicate that other, potentially treatable diseases, not smear-negative TB, may be responsible for illness attributed to TB.

Discussion

The patient travelled to central Mexico, a histoplasma-endemic region, multiple times in the setting of immunosuppression. Although immunocompromised patients are susceptible to common diseases, the lack of symptomatic and radiologic improvement despite empiric antimicrobial therapy suggested an atypical infection. The constellation of imaging findings and symptoms fit with many potential infectious causes. Therefore, tissue biopsy and histologic analyses were necessary to guide treatment.

### Growing PET positive nodule in a patient with histoplasmosis: case report [^113RSDSm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary histoplasmosis is a mycotic infection that often resembles pulmonary malignancy and continues to complicate the evaluation of pulmonary nodules.

Case Presentation

We report a case of an immunocompetent patient who, despite adequate treatment for known histoplasmosis lung infection, presented with radiological and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) findings mimicking primary lung malignancy which eventually required surgical resection.

Conclusion

Histoplasmosis infection may radiologically resemble pulmonary malignancy, often causing a diagnostic dilemma. PET imaging is currently used for and considered accurate in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules. However, overlap in PET standardized uptake value (SUV) between granulomatous and malignant lesions decreases the accuracy of PET as a diagnostic modality. Future advances in PET imaging are needed to improve its accuracy in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules in areas where histoplasmosis is endemic.

### About histoplasmosis… [^116jrckV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Histoplasmosis is a lung infection, or pneumonia, caused by breathing in spores of the fungus Histoplasmafrom the environment.
- It is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late.
- Infection can be mild to severe and can even lead to meningitis.
- Early testing and antifungal treatment helps prevent severe infections. Overview Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by breathing in Histoplasma, a fungus. Histoplasma lives in the environment in parts of the United States and the world. Most of the time when people breathe in the fungal spores, they do not get sick. However, Histoplasmosis can cause mild to life-threatening symptoms of pneumonia. Histoplasmosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because the symptoms are similar to more common pneumonias caused by bacteria or viruses.

Symptoms Symptoms of histoplasmosis include:

- Fever
- Cough
- Fatigue
- Chills
- Headache
- Chest pain
- Body aches These symptoms usually appear 3 to 17 days after breathing in the fungus. Learn more about symptoms of histoplasmosis. Severe infections Histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection, specifically among people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers diagnose histoplasmosis by collecting a sample of blood or urine for laboratory testing. it usually takes a few days to a couple of weeks to receive results. Additonal testing may include:

- Imaging tests like an X-ray or CT scan of the lungs.
- Testing fluid from the lung or respiratory tract.
- Testing a biopsy.

Patients should ask healthcare providers about testing for histoplasmosis if they live in or recently traveled to an area where Histoplasma lives and:

- Have symptoms of pneumonia.
- Already took prescribed antibiotics and are not getting better. Additional considerations for testing for histoplamsosis include:

- Patient risk factors.
- Imaging results that suggest histoplamsosis.
- Connection to an outbreak.

Histoplasmosis serology — population-specific performance and assay characteristics are summarized as follows: "The sensitivity of serology in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis ranges between 80% and 95%, in contrast to the unacceptably low sensitivity in recipients of organ transplants (18%) and those with HIV–AIDS (45%)". "The specificity of Histoplasma serology is excellent, given the low levels of background false positivity (< 5%) in residents of endemic areas outside periods of outbreaks". For enzyme immunoassay–based tests, "quantitative assays are currently available to measure serum levels of IgG and IgM, with sensitivity of 87% for IgG and 67% for IgM and specificity of 95% and 96%, respectively".

### Non-metastatic causes of multiple pulmonary nodules [^115Wre5K]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculoma, which is a rare mass or nodule caused by TB, is often seen as a single nodule in the upper lobe and may contain calcification (Fig. 1), usually appearing as a sharp-edged and rounded opacity. Multiple bilateral noncavitated pulmonary macronodules of tuberculomas are highly unusual in pulmonary TB. This presentation is mostly seen in patients with impaired immune system age-affinity. Thus, the presence of multiple larger pulmonary nodules is considered metastases, especially in patients with primary cancer. Although TB with the presentation of multiple pulmonary nodules is rare, it should be considered during differential diagnosis in developing countries and in patients with impaired immune system. The presence of centrilobular or satellite micronodules around multiple larger nodules and the presence of nodules in typical locations, such as the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes, are the major radiological findings for the differential diagnosis of TB nodules. Concomitant cavitation or calcification within nodules and clinical findings may also be useful for correct diagnosis.

Fungal infection

Fungal infection is a common condition in all populations. Lung involvement in fungal infection is common. The presentations of fungal infection vary between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Various fungi are the causative agents for pulmonary fungal infections. Pulmonary aspergillosis, candidiasis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and mucormycosis are the most frequent fungal diseases. The most common fungal disease in immunocompromised individuals is pulmonary aspergillosis. The mortality rates of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are high in immunocompromised patients. The clinical symptoms of these infections are nonspecific and can include dyspnea, fatigue, cough, and even hemoptysis. The diagnosis of the infection may be delayed due to the low sensitivity of laboratory tests and nonspecific symptoms, requiring a biopsy analysis. The immunological competence of the patient is correlated with the severity of fungal infections in pathological samples, which are characterized by necrotizing or non-necrotizing granulomas, cellular interstitial pneumonia, intra-alveolar foamy material, or minimal inflammatory alterations.

A 43-year-old injection drug user who had an HIV infection diagnosed in 2012 and was intermittently adherent to antiretroviral therapy presented to the infectious diseases outpatient clinic with a 3-month history of 10-kg weight loss, subjective fever, malaise, shortness of breath, productive yellowish cough, and progressive dyspnea, but no other significant related symptoms. On examination, he appeared chronically ill and wasted. Vital signs included a blood pressure level of 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 115/minute, and a temperature of 38.8°C. There were no mouth lesions, and chest auscultation revealed only bibasal crackles. On abdominal examination, the liver was enlarged (span, 14 cm) but not tender, neither cervical nor axillary lymphadenopathies were found, and there were no skin lesions. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 3.6 cells/mL (85% neutrophils); hemoglobin, 10.4 mg/dL; platelets, 155.000/mL; creatinine value, 0.4 mg/dL; HIV viral load, 964.168 copies/mL; and CD4 count, 23 cells/μL. Contrasted chest computed tomography was performed, showing multiple centrilobular micronodules, with a budding tree pattern and ground glass, mainly at the bases (Figures 1 and 2). With these images, a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis was suspected. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, showing multiple macrophage cells containing 2-µm-diameter intracytoplasmic yeast-like forms (arrows), consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum (Figure 3), which was confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction and culture. The patient was started on amphotericin B deoxycholate over 14 days, showing rapid improvement of symptoms. He was then sent home to continue oral itraconazole, but he never came back for follow-up.

Cavitation

A cavity is defined as a gas-filled space, seen as lucency or low-attenuation area within pulmonary consolidation, mass or nodule. Cavitation can occur in both benign and malignant nodules. In benign nodules, cavitation is mainly associated with abscesses (bacterial) pulmonary tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, aspergilloma (Fig. 18), and other fungal infections, Wegener granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis. Even in infectious causes, there are often no clinical symptoms of infection, raising difficulties for diagnosis. Cavitation in malignant SPNs is caused by necrosis of the central portion and is mainly seen in squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 19) and metastasis. Wall thickness, irregularity, and cavity morphology have been regarded as partially useful for differentiating benignity from malignancy, with great overlap of features. A thicker irregular wall and irregular inner contour are both observed in malignant nodules and in benign diseases. Associated ground glass, consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and the presence of satellite nodules are indicative of a benign nature of the cavitary nodule. Since infectious (bacterial) or inflammatory cavitation often present with rapid changes, short-term follow-up with chest radiographs can be the key to diagnosis. Rapid progression in these cases excludes a malignant cause. Correlation with clinical setting and often histology is mandatory in cavitated nodules since imaging can barely differentiate between benign and malignant.

Fig. 18
Chest radiograph in a 59-year-old woman with a previous history of heart transplantation showed a nodule in the right upper lobe. This was confirmed on chest CT scan with axial images in lung window setting showing a 2.4 cm nodule with central cavitation. Since efforts to prove an infectious cause remained unsuccessful and the lesion persisted, wedge excision was performed. Histopathologic examination could not reveal any malignancy, but showed findings consistent with an aspergilloma

### Growing PET positive nodule in a patient with histoplasmosis: case report [^1125B675]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with inadequate CMI, such as those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), may develop progressive disseminated histoplasmosis, an often rapidly progressive and fatal illness that presents with fever, anemia, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, central nervous system involvement, and cardiac manifestations.

Several laboratory tests are useful in the diagnosis of infections caused by H. capsulatum. Culture samples of the organism remain the gold standard for diagnosis. The samples are usually recovered from bone marrow, liver, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Histopathologic visualization using special stains such as Giemsa or Methenamine Silver stains also aids in the diagnosis and yields very rapid results. Complement fixation is another test used for the diagnosis of H. capsulatum, detecting both mycelial and yeast antigens.

Most patients with the acute form of histoplasmosis do not require antimicrobial therapy, as they remain asymptomatic or improve spontaneously. Patients presenting with the chronic form of histoplasmosis are usually treated with itraconazole for 6–12 months as a first line of treatment. Patients presenting with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis usually require induction therapy with intravenous amphotericin B, although it has been shown that some patients may respond to itraconazole as a first line therapy. Once stabilized, patients may be switched from amphotericin B to itraconazole. Patients with HIV who present with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis require life-long maintenance therapy.

Surgical intervention is occasionally required in patients with histoplasmosis. The finding of a histoplasmoma presenting as a lung nodule or mass on a chest X-ray or CT scan often raises concern for malignancy, which may require thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Pulmonary calcification and ossification

Introduction and clinical features

Pulmonary calcification and ossification are the most common metabolic lung diseases detected on chest radiography and HRCT. Pulmonary calcification occurs either through dystrophic or metastatic mechanisms. Dystrophic calcifications form in damaged areas of lung as a result of inflammation or infection, such as tuberculosis, or in areas of previous haemorrhage or infarct. Calcification can also form in neoplasms such as chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma as a natural process of the disease. Metastatic pulmonary calcification develops in areas of normal lung in patients with altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, leading to calcium deposition in the lungs and other organs such as bones and kidneys. Hypercalcaemia secondary to chronic renal failure (Fig. 1) is the most common cause of metastatic pulmonary calcification. Other causes include primary hyperparathyroidism, skeletal metastases and multiple myeloma. The various causes are summarised in Table 3.

Diffuse pulmonary ossification has been increasingly recognised since the advent of CT. Pathologically, pulmonary ossification can be classified as either nodular (NPO) or dendriform (DPO) based on the respective morphological appearances. Of the two entities, NPO is more common.

Nodular pulmonary ossification

Classically described with long-standing severe mitral stenosis, NPO can occur with any condition, leading to chronic pulmonary oedema and pulmonary venous hypertension. Histologically, NPO is characterised by calcified or ossified intra-alveolar masses that are usually devoid of marrow elements or fat.

Imaging findings

On radiography HRCT, small, discrete, round calcified nodules 1–5 mm in diameter are present in the mid to lower lungs (Fig. 2). The differential diagnosis in these patients includes healed varicella infection or remote disseminated granulomatous infections such as histoplasmosis.

Radiographic Discussion

The chest CT imaging showed bilateral upper lung-predominant centrilobular and clustered nodular opacities (Fig 1A, 1B). The preterminal bronchioles and accompanying pulmonary arteries travel through the center of the secondary pulmonary lobules. Diseases affecting either these airways or vessels manifest as micronodules in the center of the secondary pulmonary lobule, described as a centrilobular pattern. The clustered tree-in-bud pattern typically represents impaction of centrilobular bronchioles with mucus, fluid, pus, or a combination thereof with associated peribronchiolar inflammation. These nodules can be seen in bronchiolitis or with other inflammatory imaging findings, including bronchial wall thickening, consolidation, ground-glass opacities, or a combination thereof. Therefore, the differential considerations of the patient's lung nodules included bronchiolitis and infections with endobronchial spread. Atypical pathogens such as viral, mycobacterial, and fungal infection (eg, aspergillosis or histoplasmosis) should be considered in immunosuppressed patients. Cavitations are seen commonly with TB and vasculitis, which were not present in this patient. The lack of marked lymphadenopathy also made TB and disseminated Epstein-Barr virus infection less likely.

On brain MRI, the patient showed leptomeningeal involvement, which can be seen with atypical infections or metastatic disease. Basilar meningeal involvement is a common feature on neuroimaging in disseminated fungal infection. Ischemic strokes are relatively rare in disseminated histoplasmosis and usually are secondary to granulomatous arteritis vs embolic phenomena. Although vessel biopsy was not performed in this patient, transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble showed no concerning features for embolic disease. Overall, the radiologic findings were nonspecific, but given the combination of lung and leptomeningeal involvement, atypical infection was considered most likely on differential diagnosis. Biopsy location then was determined based on the pulmonary lesions.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) histoplasmosis guideline update — scope, topics, and methods are outlined: As the first part of an update, the panel presents 4 updated recommendations spanning treatment of asymptomatic Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas), mild acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, and moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, based on systematic literature reviews and a GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rating certainty and strength. The scope includes treatment of asymptomatic Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas) and mild or moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis; available evidence for children, adults, and pregnant people was reviewed, and newborns and patients with African histoplasmosis or possible ocular histoplasmosis syndrome were excluded. Background context notes that histoplasmosis is caused by infection with the thermally dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, occurs through inhalation of H. capsulatum with worldwide distribution but hyperendemic areas such as the midwestern United States, and that disease severity ranges from asymptomatic to severe depending on inoculum and cell-mediated immune function; definitions of asymptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis and mild, moderate, and severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis appear in Table 1.

### Imaging-guided chest biopsies: techniques and clinical results [^1141A15s]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical indication

Clinical indications of imaging-guided chest biopsy have significantly changed from the introduction of the technique as a result of technical advances in needle technology, imaging modalities, pathological analysis and immunohistochemistry techniques. The introduction of PET-CT further modified these indications, reducing the percentage of unnecessary biopsies. At present, the growing list of indications (Table 1) includes histological diagnosis of undetermined and otherwise not characterisable pulmonary, mediastinal and chest wall lesions as well as biopsy or re-biopsy of known malignant lesions to obtain histological material for targeted therapy. (Fig. 1).

Indications for CT-guided chest biopsy. (a) Solitary pulmonary nodule. (b) Parenchymal infiltrates in which an infectious organism cannot be isolated. (c) Hilar mass following negative bronchoscopy. (d) Undiagnosed mediastinal mass

A new or enlarging solitary nodule or mass

The increasing clinical use of chest CT has resulted in an increasing incidental detection of small pulmonary nodules. In particular, pulmonary nodules are incidentally detected in around 8.5% of the general population and in up to 51% of subjects with risk factors. Therefore, a new or enlarging solitary nodule is the most common indication for imaging-guided chest biopsy. If a nodule is initially identified at conventional chest radiography, CT investigation is necessary to characterise the lesion, estimate the likelihood of malignancy and identify lymphadenopathies or other accessible sites for biopsy (such as extra-thoracic metastases). PET-CT examination may also be helpful in the management of pulmonary nodules larger than 1 cm, reducing the need of puncture of non-enhancing solid nodules and with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 83% for solid pulmonary nodules between 1 and 3 cm in diameter. It must be taken in consideration that active inflammation (i.e. active tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, rheumatoid nodules) may cause false positives on PET-CT scans because of their high glucose metabolism. On the other hand, low-grade malignant tumours, such as carcinoid or low-grade adenocarcinoma, may produce false-negative results because of their low glucose metabolism. In these cases, careful follow-up with CT must be performed according to well-established guidelines to demonstrate regression/disappearance of the nodule after therapy or to address patients to biopsy if persistence or increase in size are evident.

- multiple, diffuse, or confluent opacities on the chest radiograph

- suspected noninfectious disease and an abnormal chest radiograph.

Differential diagnosis

The patient's chest CT revealed a cavitary right upper lobe mass, miliary pulmonary nodules and necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The radiographical differential of cavitary lesions and miliary nodules included congenital pulmonary airway malformations, lung abscesses, septic emboli, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, sarcoidosis and malignancies. However, the combination of findings in the setting of immunosuppression were highly suspicious for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Asymptomatic coccidioidal cavity management — We recommend against the use of antifungal therapy for patients with an asymptomatic cavity (strong, low). Coccidioidal pneumonia can leave a thin-walled cavity as a residual in 5% of cases; in a patient who is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed, periodic follow-up observation is recommended, and usually, periodic plain radiographs of the chest are adequate for monitoring; if cavities are very large or adjacent to the pleura, they may rupture, but this complication is surprisingly infrequent and antifungal treatment would not prevent this.

### Cavitary lung diseases: a clinical-radiologic algorithmic approach [^112yhoZd]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cavities occasionally are encountered on thoracic images. Their differential diagnosis is large and includes, among others, various infections, autoimmune conditions, and primary and metastatic malignancies. We offer an algorithmic approach to their evaluation by initially excluding mimics of cavities and then broadly classifying them according to the duration of clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities. An acute or subacute process (< 12 weeks) suggests common bacterial and uncommon nocardial and fungal causes of pulmonary abscesses, necrotizing pneumonias, and septic emboli. A chronic process (≥ 12 weeks) suggests mycobacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections; malignancy (primary lung cancer or metastases); or autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Although a number of radiographic features can suggest a diagnosis, their lack of specificity requires that imaging findings be combined with the clinical context to make a confident diagnosis.

### Reversed halo sign: high-resolution CT scan findings in 79 patients [^116oaaaj]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan findings of patients with the reversed halo sign (RHS) and to identify distinguishing features among the various causes.

Methods

Two chest radiologists reviewed the HRCT scans of 79 patients with RHS and determined the CT scan findings by consensus. We studied the morphologic characteristics, number of lesions, and presence of features associated with RHS.

Results

Forty-one patients presented with infectious diseases (paracoccidioidomycosis, TB, zygomycosis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis), and 38 presented with noninfectious diseases (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, sarcoidosis, edema, lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma [formerly bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma], granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener]). The RHS walls were smooth in 58 patients (73.4%) and nodular in 21 patients (26.6%). Lesions were multiple in 40 patients (50.6%) and single in 39 patients (49.4%).

Conclusion

The presence of nodular walls or nodules inside the halo of the RHS is highly suggestive of granulomatous diseases.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with histoplasmosis: 2007 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gqBQB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with histoplasmosis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous treatment guidelines published in 2000 (Clin Infect Dis 2000; 30:688–95). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. Since 2000, several new antifungal agents have become available, and clinical trials and case series have increased our understanding of the management of histoplasmosis. Advances in immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory disorders have created new questions about the approach to prevention and treatment of histoplasmosis. New information, based on publications from the period 1999–2006, are incorporated into this guideline document. In addition, the panel added recommendations for management of histoplasmosis in children for those aspects that differ from aspects in adults.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1173zfRX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale and implementation considerations

Histoplasma antigen appears to be most useful in patients with high fungal burden (i.e. those with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, in whom antibody detection is not as reliable, especially early after the exposure and in those unable to mount an antibody response due to immunosuppression). Histoplasma antigen testing is available in specialized centers or through mail-in reference laboratories. Combining antibody and antigen testing further improves the diagnostic yield in pulmonary histoplasmosis. In addition to serum and urine, Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid in Histoplasma meningitis and in BAL in pulmonary histoplasmosis.

In a hypothetical population of 1,000 random patients who reside in an endemic area with a prevalence of 10%, testing for Histoplasma antigen would yield 81 true-positive results, 19 false-negative results, 15 false-positive results, and 885 true-negative results, with a positive predictive value of 0.84 and a negative predictive value of 0.50. During a period of outbreak when the prevalence in the at-risk population can be as high as 25%, the yield would be 204 true positives, 46 false positives, 13 false positives, and 737 true negatives, with a positive predictive value of 0.94 and a negative predictive value of 0.50. However, a positive Histoplasma antigen in an immunocompromised patient with suspected histoplasmosis (0.5 pretest probability) would result in a posttest probability of 0.98, given the positive likelihood ratio of 43.2.

Radiologic presentation findings

The thoracic CT findings are summarized in Table 2. Single nodule pattern was the most frequent lesion pattern, presenting in 33 of the 39 (84.6%) patients, followed by scattered nodule (7.7%), clustered nodule (5.1%), and mass-like (2.5%) (Fig. 1). Pleural effusion was not seen in any patient and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was observed in 10 patients. Most lesions were located in the right upper lobe (15 lesions, 31.9%), followed by right lower lobe (13 lesions, 27.6%) and left lower lobe (13 lesions, 27.6%). Pulmonary lesions (38 out of 47, 80.9%) were located mostly in the peripheral lung field (outer third of the lung). The diameter of the lung lesions was less than 1 cm in nine lesions (19.1%), 1–2 cm in 30 lesions (63.8%), and greater than 2 cm in eight lesions (17%). 20 (42.6%) lesions were spiculated. Air bronchogram was noted in three lesions (6.4%), halo sign in nine (19.1%), and pleural indentation in 10 (21.3%). Cavitation was noted in 11 lesions and was more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients (5 out of 11, 45.5%) than in immunocompetent patients (6 out of 36, 16.7%) (P = 0.04).

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — follow-up serology, imaging, and fatigue reconditioning: Repeated serologic testing should seldom be any more frequent than every 2 weeks and usually ranges from 1 month to several months between tests. Chest radiographs should be repeated to demonstrate either resolution or to document residual abnormalities; early in infection, the interval may be as frequent as several days, and subsequent chest radiographs should be obtained every several weeks to every several months. Often 2 views of the chest are sufficient to monitor progress, and the increased sensitivity of CT scans is not usually needed as the patient improves. For persistent fatigue, reconditioning programs are useful if continued for several weeks or months.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA 2025 histoplasmosis guideline — itraconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) advises that TDM should be performed for patients receiving itraconazole, with recent studies showing approximately 20% of patients required dose adjustments due to sub- or super-therapeutic levels of itraconazole and approximately 28% experienced side effects. A goal trough concentration of itraconazole component > 1 mg/L and < 3–4 mg/L (as measured by chromatographic assay) is associated with efficacy and a lower risk of toxicity. Due to the long half-life of itraconazole, non-trough/random levels can also be used; hydroxy-itraconazole is an active metabolite but a cutoff for combined hydroxy-itraconazole and itraconazole levels has not been established, and patients with a combined hydroxy- itraconazole and itraconazole level > 2 mg/L may respond similarly to patients with itraconazole levels > 1 mg/L.

### Radiology-based diagnosis of fungal pulmonary infections in high-risk hematology patients: are we making progress? [^111Ue3Tr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fungal pneumonia, primarily caused by Aspergillus and less commonly known Mucorales, poses a significant threat to individuals with prolonged neutropenia because of chemotherapy or weakened immune systems following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Timely detection of invasive fungal disease (IFD) is crucial in reducing mortality rates as antifungal therapy is most effective early in infection and reduces the risk of dissemination. Although nonculture-based diagnostic tools such as fungal antigen biomarkers and PCR have improved early diagnosis in the last two decades, recommended methods for the diagnostic imaging of fungal pneumonia have remained relatively unchanged. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest continues to be the preferred diagnostic imaging approach for IFD, with the ability to identify abnormalities in up to 60% of neutropenic patients with fever, even when chest X-rays appear normal. Typical radiological patterns associated with IFD include nodules with or without ground-glass opacities, masses, consolidations, wedge-shaped infarcts, pleural effusions, and in later stages, cavitary lesions. These radiologic signs are not specific to fungal infections and can also reflect the presence of co-infections or inflammatory processes. CT findings also play a valuable role in guiding further invasive diagnostic procedures such as flexible bronchoscopy with alveolar lavage and/or CT-guided biopsy, which are essential for establishing a definitive microbiological and histological diagnosis.

Talaromycosis in people with advanced HIV disease — clinical manifestations are characterized by disseminated infection involving multiple organ systems as the most common manifestation, beginning as a subacute illness with nonspecific features that are indistinguishable from other infections. Skin lesions are the most specific late manifestation, present in 40% to 80% of patients, and are typically central-umbilicated papules that appear first on the face and then spread to the trunk and extremities. Pulmonary symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath occur in approximately 40% of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea or abdominal pain occur in 30% of patients, and hepatosplenomegaly is common, presenting in up to 60% of patients with intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy causing abdominal distention and pain. A rare complication occurring in about 4% of patients is meningoencephalitis, with a rapid disease course and a high mortality of up to 80%. Coinfection with oropharyngeal candidiasis occurs in up to 50% of patients and with tuberculosis in 22% of patients. Laboratory findings include anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration, anemia can be profound and may require multiple red cell transfusions, and elevation of aminotransferases is common with a serum aspartate aminotransferase over alanine aminotransferase ratio of approximately 2. Chest radiographical abnormalities are broad and nonspecific, ranging from diffuse interstitial disease to reticulonodular infiltrates to alveolar infiltrates.

We describe the computed tomography and F-18 FDG PET findings of a patient with extensive mediastinal nodal enlargement resulting from histoplasmosis. This patient with known metastatic melanoma presenting for restaging was initially considered to have widespread mediastinal and cervical metastases on the basis of the imaging findings. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and transbronchial lymph node biopsy were consistent with histoplasmosis. The imaging findings improved after treatment with antifungal medication. A relatively small area of pulmonary involvement proved to be the clue in the imaging studies that the disease was inflammatory rather than neoplastic.

A careful review of systems and physical examination is essential". "If these do not identify focal extrapulmonary problems, routine screening imaging studies, such as bone surveys, radionuclide bone scans, or whole-body computed tomography (CT) or MRI, are usually unnecessary to fully assess extent of disease". "In particular, lumbar punctures are unnecessary in most patients without signs or symptoms of CNS involvement". "In contrast, if history or physical examination identifies 1 or more specific anatomic areas of potential concern, further imaging studies appropriate for that area are warranted".

### Clinical implications of pulmonary nodules detected in children [^114D7fc1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of children found to have pulmonary nodules is not well established. We determined how often diagnostic testing was pursued, the outcome of diagnostic testing, and how often pulmonary nodules were given a definitive diagnosis.

Method

A retrospective review of patients found to have pulmonary nodules. Patients with oncologic diagnoses were excluded. Data collected included number of nodules, presence of pre-existing systemic disease, laboratory testing, presence of respiratory symptoms, repeat imaging, biopsy result, and final diagnosis.

Results

We identified 88 patients, of which 56 (64%) had a single nodule, 21 (24%) had a pre-existing nononcologic systemic disease, and four patients (5%) had a new systemic disease identified at the same time the nodule(s) was found. In otherwise healthy patients presenting with a solitary nodule, 94% did not have a definitive diagnosis and none went on to be diagnosed with systemic disease. Serum infectious work-up result for tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, or aspergillosis was not significantly different between single and multiple nodule/systemic illness groups. No previously healthy patients presenting with a solitary nodule were later diagnosed with malignancy.

Conclusion

Diagnostic workup for a solitary pulmonary nodule was often inconclusive, especially if the patient did not have symptoms at presentation. Pulmonary nodules were not the sole presenting sign of systemic disease for any subjects. We suggest that in an otherwise healthy pediatric patient found to have an asymptomatic single pulmonary nodule, observation without laboratory work-up or repeat imaging is a reasonable option.

### Clinical features and high-resolution CT findings of pulmonary cryptococcosis in non-AIDS patients [^114zESVm]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to clarify clinical and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) characteristics in non-AIDS patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. We analyzed the medical records and HRCT scans in 22 patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis from 1988 to 2003. Thirteen patients (59%) were immunocompetent and nine (41%) were immunosuppressed, seven of whom had diabetes mellitus. No patients exhibited extrapulmonary involvement. Nineteen patients (86%) were asymptomatic. Radiography revealed incidental chest abnormality in all but two patients. The typical HRCT findings were solitary or multiple nodules in the subpleural area. Cavitation was present in 30% of the patients who had nodules. The most frequently applied and reliable diagnostic procedure was video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Treatment included antifungal therapy alone in 11 patients, surgery alone in eight including four treated by VATS, surgery plus antifungal therapy in two and none in one. Patients who underwent surgery alone did not develop any relapse. The majority of non-AIDS patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis present with incidental chest radiographic abnormalities. The most common HRCT findings are solitary or multiple nodules with or without cavitation in the subpleural areas of the lung. VATS is a useful tool for both diagnosis and treatment of isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis.

### Lung involvement in childhood onset granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^112hZ6ed]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary function tests

When tested for pulmonary function, patients affected by GPA most commonly show airflow obstruction, often in association with a reduced diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. Reduction of lung volumes has also been described. In a pediatric series, of the 35 patients who performed pulmonary function tests, 27 had abnormal results, with obstructive and restrictive abnormalities detected in the same proportion of cases. Sixty-seven patients of the ARChiVe cohort performed pulmonary function tests, which were abnormal in 61% of cases. Since pulmonary involvement in GPA may be initially asymptomatic, it should be investigated not only radiographically, but also with pulmonary function testing. The first sign of pulmonary haemorrhage may be an alteration in the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. In patients with subglottic stenosis, the flow-volume curve shows a flattening in both inspiratory and expiratory phase, consistent with an extrathoracic airway obstruction.

Differential diagnosis

In the presence of lung disease, concomitant upper airway and kidney involvement can guide the clinician towards GPA diagnosis. Other conditions associated with pulmonary-renal syndrome, such as Goodpasture's syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus eythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease, should be excluded. Laboratory evidence of positive ANCA, in particular c-ANCA or PR3-ANCA, and a compatible kidney biopsy, are supportive findings of GPA diagnosis. Lung involvement of ulcerative colitis associated with ANCA positivity may also mimic GPA.

Considering nodular lung lesions, neoplastic disease and sarcoidosis should also be suspected. In children, also chronic granulomatous disease has to be considered. Other causes of alveolar haemorrhage described in the pediatric population are idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis and childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus.

Another important differential diagnosis is with infectious processes, in particular mycobacterial, micotic or helmintic infections. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage has been described as a consequence of pulmonary histoplasmosis. It should also be remembered that lung disease in GPA patients may also be due to concomitant infections, in particular Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the immunocompromised patient.

### Imaging features and differential diagnoses of non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases [^1146jqHR]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM), also known as sclerosing mediastinitis, is a condition related to an abnormal immunologic reaction that results in the proliferation of fibro-inflammatory tissue in the mediastinum and/or hila. It leads to a variable constriction of systemic veins, pulmonary arteries and veins, the airways and/or the esophagus, with a morbidity related to location and extent of fibrosis. The pleura, pericardium, and coronary arteries may also be involved.

Table 1
Fibrosing mediastinitis and differential diagnoses

Granulomatous subtype

The most common form is the focal or granulomatous subtype of fibrosing mediastinitis, mainly due to histoplasmosis (less frequently tuberculosis), and other fungal or inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis. This form usually manifests as a localized, calcified mass in the paratracheal or subcarinal regions of the mediastinum or in the pulmonary hila, commonly responsible for a superior vena cava syndrome. Diagnosis can be made based on imaging findings, preventing the need for tissue sampling.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: treatment of fungal infections in adult pulmonary and critical care patients [^116Uij1h]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

With increasing numbers of immune-compromised patients with malignancy, hematologic disease, and HIV, as well as those receiving immunosupressive drug regimens for the management of organ transplantation or autoimmune inflammatory conditions, the incidence of fungal infections has dramatically increased over recent years. Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary fungal infections has also been substantially assisted by the development of newer diagnostic methods and techniques, including the use of antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction, serologies, computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and video-assisted thorascopic biopsy. At the same time, the introduction of new treatment modalities has significantly broadened options available to physicians who treat these conditions. While traditionally antifungal therapy was limited to the use of amphotericin B, flucytosine, and a handful of clinically available azole agents, current pharmacologic treatment options include potent new azole compounds with extended antifungal activity, lipid forms of amphotericin B, and newer antifungal drugs, including the echinocandins. In view of the changing treatment of pulmonary fungal infections, the American Thoracic Society convened a working group of experts in fungal infections to develop a concise clinical statement of current therapeutic options for those fungal infections of particular relevance to pulmonary and critical care practice. This document focuses on three primary areas of concern: the endemic mycoses, including histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis; fungal infections of special concern for immune-compromised and critically ill patients, including cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia; and rare and emerging fungal infections.

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

Granulomatous infection

Microbial infections that elicit a granulomatous tissue response can also result in a variety of thoracic dystrophic calcifications. TB is a common cause of intrathoracic calcifications, especially in Asia and Africa. Apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes are often involved because of the high ventilation-perfusion ratio and decreased lymphatic drainage. As dystrophic calcifications are the sequelae of infection, patients with a prior infection are more common than those with newly diagnosed active disease. Therefore, CT findings of distortion of bronchovascular structures, bronchiectasis, emphysema, and fibrotic bands are frequently seen with calcification. Calcification shows numerous patterns related to fibrosis and granulomatous tissue, such as linear, nodular, micronodular, or even with nodular or mass-like soft tissue-attenuation components (Supplementary Figs. S 16 and S 17). The Ghon focus, a primary lesion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, usually heals through development of a fibrous capsule around the focus of infection, which may show tiny calcification (Supplementary Fig. S 18). Calcification of tuberculoma, a round or oval granuloma with a wall lined by granulomatous inflammatory tissue or encapsulated by connective tissue, is found in 20 to 30% of patients and may show coarse calcification. Soft tissue attenuation can be accompanied by calcification, which is related to caseous necrotic material. In addition, when caseous necrosis occurs, robust phosphatase activity can take place within the necrotic centers, and subsequently, calcification is invariably found in the phosphatase-positive areas.

Other granulomatous infections can also cause calcification. Histoplasmomas may show numerous small and diffuse calcified pulmonary nodules. Although uncommon, coccidiomycosis may result in single or multiple dystrophic calcified nodules. Further, diffuse, dense calcifications of 2 to 3 mm may occur in otherwise normal lungs as a sequela of varicella pneumonia.

### Spectrum of [F] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^112TNWxU]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

An uncommon but important complication of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is fibrosing mediastinitis. It is a benign, progressive fibroinflammatory process that manifests as an infiltrating mediastinal soft tissue mass usually located within the middle mediastinum. It can result in the distortion and compression of major vessels and central airways and is a common cause of superior vena cava syndrome. On FDG-PET/CT, fibrosing mediastinitis can show varying levels of FDG uptake, demonstrating increased uptake in the more acute, active inflammatory stage (Fig. 3a–c) and little to no uptake in more chronic disease. This suggests a possible role for FDG-PET/CT in assessing disease activity, which can inform treatment decisions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis — diagnosis in HIV emphasizes antigen detection, with detection of Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine being a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis but insensitive for chronic pulmonary infection. In a study using a newer quantitative assay, Histoplasma antigen was detected in 100% of urine samples and 92% of serum samples from people with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis, and antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may also be useful method for diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis; in severe disseminated disease, peripheral blood smears can show organisms engulfed by white blood cells and biopsy often demonstrates characteristic 2 to 4 μm budding yeast cells. Culture of H. capsulatum from blood, bone marrow, respiratory secretions, or other sites is possible in > 85% of patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis but requires several weeks to grow, while serologic tests are less useful than antigen assays in AIDS-related disseminated disease but may help in pulmonary disease with reasonably intact immune responses. For central nervous system (CNS) disease, usual cerebrospinal fluid findings are lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose; fungal stains are usually negative and cultures are positive in a minority of cases, with a review including patients with HIV reporting cultures positive in 38% of patients. Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a far greater number of cases and antibodies are seen in approximately one-half of cases, and a positive antigen or antibody test result from CSF is diagnostic for histoplasmosis; if specific tests are negative, a presumptive diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is appropriate when the patient has disseminated histoplasmosis and findings of CNS infection not attributable to another cause.

Regarding medical management for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to management of fibrosing mediastinitis, ATS 2011 guidelines recommend to consider performing placement of intravascular stents,
bronchoplasty, and/or placement of endobronchial stents, if appropriate expertise is available, in selected patients with fibrosing mediastinitis and severe vascular or airway compromise. Consider using removable stents initially if a decision is made to place a stent.

Infliximab — clinician considerations for patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients emphasize infection and hepatitis risk assessment and vaccine precautions: Tuberculin skin testing and a chest radiograph should be obtained and reviewed prior to therapy, with consideration of risks for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, or coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. Hepatitis serology should be obtained prior to onset of therapy, and use of infliximab should be avoided if active viral hepatitis is present; patients with a history of viral hepatitis or chronic carrier states should be monitored for viral hepatitis reactivation as long as patients are receiving therapy. Live vaccines should be avoided while patients are being treated with infliximab, and there are no specific recommendations for prophylaxis against infections.

Solitary pulmonary nodule in suspected coccidioidomycosis — A solitary pulmonary nodule with little or no increase in metabolic activity on PET scan, in a patient with low risk of malignancy, may be followed with careful serial imaging to document stability for a period of at least 2 years. When evaluation reveals a more complex situation, many solitary pulmonary nodules are accessible to CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy, which has generally been found to have excellent yield in terms of providing a specific diagnosis; including fungal cultures of biopsy material increases the likelihood of positive needle biopsies, and in the event of a nondiagnostic needle biopsy, it may be necessary to perform a thoracoscopic or open surgical lung resection; these patients should be followed closely for signs of active coccidioidomycosis, and serologic testing for coccidioidomycosis is appropriate, for staging and to establish a baseline for follow-up.

### Broncholithiasis: review of the causes with radiologic-pathologic correlation [^111PmAr9]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Broncholithiasis is defined as a condition in which calcified or ossified material is present within the bronchial lumen. Radiographic findings of broncholithiasis include airway obstruction such as atelectasis, mucoid impaction, bronchiectasis, and expiratory air trapping. Broncholithiasis is strongly suggested at computed tomography (CT) when an endobronchial or peribronchial calcified nodule is associated with findings of bronchial obstruction. Volume data acquisition by means of helical CT with sections less than 3 mm in thickness and multiplanar reformation along the bronchial tree are helpful in confirming the endobronchial location of the calcified material. The most common cause of broncholithiasis is erosion by and extrusion of a calcified adjacent lymph node into the bronchial lumen, a finding usually associated with tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. Other causes of broncholithiasis include (a) aspiration of bone tissue or in situ calcification of aspirated foreign material and (b) erosion by and extrusion of calcified or ossified bronchial cartilage plates. Primary endobronchial infections with dystrophic calcification, calcified endobronchial tumors, tracheobronchial diseases with mural calcification, and hypertrophied bronchial artery with intramural protrusion may mimic broncholithiasis. An awareness of the typical imaging findings of broncholithiasis, along with a knowledge of its various causes, help in establishing an accurate diagnosis to ensure proper case management.
