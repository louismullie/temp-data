## Question

What is the clinical presentation of orthostatic hypotension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical presentation of orthostatic hypotension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and pathophysiologic basis that anchor the syndrome. Then, I should verify the classic and subtle symptomatology and how posture modifies them. Next, I will check the frequency and implications of asymptomatic presentations and the weak symptom–blood pressure correlation. After that, I'll consider phenotypic subtypes, context-specific features like neurogenic OH with supine hypertension, and temporal triggers such as morning and postprandial worsening. Finally, I will confirm the diagnostic implications, emphasizing objective measurements and when to escalate to tilt or autonomic testing.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't build on a shaky foundation. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, with the symptom mechanism grounded in inadequate compensatory responses to gravitational venous pooling and resultant cerebral and organ hypoperfusion. Wait, I should verify nuances in patients with supine hypertension; in that population, a ≥ 30 mmHg systolic threshold (and sometimes ≥ 15 mmHg diastolic) is more appropriate because the magnitude of the orthostatic drop scales with the baseline BP, so applying a uniform 20/10 criterion would under-recognize clinically relevant OH in this subgroup [^111s41GT] [^111jn2Ym].

> I will now examine the classic overt symptoms, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without linking them to posture. The most recognizable manifestations reflect cerebral hypoperfusion and include lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope, syncope, and visual disturbances such as blurring or "graying out", typically provoked by standing and relieved by sitting or lying down, which is a key historical discriminator for orthostatic mechanisms [^111s41GT] [^113612CJ] [^117K1NdP]. I should also note systemic hypoperfusion features such as dyspnea and chest discomfort that can mimic angina in the absence of obstructive coronary disease, as well as orthostatic headache and characteristic "coat hanger" neck and shoulder pain attributed to ischemia of the paraspinal musculature, all of which strengthen the orthostatic hypothesis when temporally linked to upright posture and improve with recumbence [^111s41GT] [^113612CJ].

> Next, I should review the non-classic, subtle symptoms because under-recognition often stems from them. Many patients report non-specific fatigue, generalized weakness, cognitive slowing or difficulty concentrating, leg buckling, and exercise intolerance rather than frank presyncope, and these symptoms can dominate the clinical picture while still being posture dependent and relieved by recumbence, which can easily be missed unless specifically queried [^111s41GT] [^111HBx54] [^117K1NdP]. Hmm, wait a minute, nausea and headache are often discussed in the orthostatic intolerance spectrum more broadly; while not pathognomonic for OH per se, they can co-occur with orthostatic syndromes like POTS and appear in OH cohorts as part of orthostasis-triggered symptom clusters, so I should frame them cautiously as possible but non-specific orthostatic complaints [^114vZw6V] [^113612CJ].

> But wait, what if there are no symptoms at all; does that exclude OH? I need to ensure I address the asymptomatic phenotype because it is clinically pivotal. A substantial proportion of older adults with objective OH report no typical dizziness or lightheadedness, with cohorts showing roughly two-thirds asymptomatic at the time of orthostatic testing, and asymptomatic OH independently associates with unexplained falls and future fracture risk, underscoring that symptom absence does not confer safety nor exclude hemodynamic vulnerability [^113K4VHQ] [^notfound]. I should double-check whether profound BP falls still might be silent; indeed, even patients with very large decreases during tilt, on the order of ≥ 60 mmHg systolic, can be entirely asymptomatic or have atypical complaints, reinforcing that history alone is insufficient to screen out clinically meaningful OH [^112zpMwa] [^113iw1gF].

> Hold on, I should verify the relationship between symptom intensity and blood pressure changes because this influences how we triage patients. Multiple studies demonstrate a poor correlation between symptom severity and either the magnitude of systolic drop or the achieved upright systolic pressure during tilt or stand, with many patients reporting minimal symptoms despite substantial hemodynamic compromise, which mandates objective measurement rather than reliance on symptoms for diagnosis or risk stratification [^113iw1gF] [^113X16Sj]. Let me reconsider if any subgroup behaves differently; although individual thresholds vary, the overarching message remains that symptoms alone cannot reliably identify or exclude OH, so structured orthostatic vitals are essential in all suspected cases [^113X16Sj].

> Next, I should synthesize the full clinical spectrum and incorporate temporal and phenomenologic subtypes. Presentations span a continuum from classic syncope or near-syncope with dramatic BP drops, through milder forms with visual blurring, fatigue, and cognitive fog, to atypical chest or neck-shoulder pain and even entirely asymptomatic orthostatic BP falls, and all are typically positional and relieved by recumbence, which is a key historical clue to elicit deliberately [^113612CJ] [^117K1NdP]. Let me also check for hemodynamic phenotypes beyond "classic OH"; improved continuous BP profiling has delineated initial OH, delayed BP recovery, classic OH, and delayed OH, each with distinct timing and prognostic implications, and some forms like delayed BP recovery are easily missed by intermittent cuff measurements yet carry risks comparable to classic OH in older adults with orthostatic (pre)syncope [^114nQSqq] [^115s3fpu] [^111bb6qd].

> I will now examine context-specific patterns because they refine pretest probability and counseling. In community-dwelling older adults, OH is common and frequently asymptomatic, contributing to unexplained falls; in neurogenic OH associated with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, OH often coexists with supine hypertension due to baroreflex failure, complicating both recognition and management and necessitating deliberate supine BP assessment to avoid iatrogenic harm, with symptoms often worse in the morning and after meals and mitigated by recumbence [^113K4VHQ] [^115w65E6] [^113sfH2Y] [^117K1NdP]. Hold on, I should verify whether postprandial exacerbation is consistently recognized; consensus statements and clinical reviews indeed highlight morning predominance and postprandial worsening as practical historical anchors to prompt testing in at-risk groups such as the elderly and those with autonomic neurodegeneration [^117K1NdP] [^111s41GT].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic implications so the reasoning naturally leads to action. Because symptoms are variable, non-specific, or absent, bedside orthostatic vital signs with a standardized active stand after at least 5 minutes supine, with measurements at 1 and 3 minutes upright, are mandatory to establish the diagnosis; if bedside testing is nondiagnostic but suspicion persists, head-up tilt or prolonged monitoring can reveal delayed OH or other orthostatic patterns, and select patients merit autonomic testing for neurogenic etiologies, especially when heart rate responses are blunted [^112DCV2o] [^111JYUVe] [^113612CJ] [^115f5hXG] [^111jn2Ym]. I should double-check a common pitfall: applying a uniform 20/10 threshold to supine hypertensives; as noted earlier, adjusting the criterion upward in that subgroup avoids false negatives and better captures clinically meaningful OH in patients at risk of baroreflex failure and supine hypertension [^111s41GT] [^111jn2Ym].

> To conclude, the clinical presentation of orthostatic hypotension extends far beyond "dizziness on standing" and often includes subtle cognitive and fatigue phenotypes or no symptoms at all, which means we must proactively test and not rely on history to exclude disease; the weak symptom–BP correlation, the existence of multiple orthostatic hemodynamic subtypes, and the prevalence of asymptomatic falls in older or neurogenic populations compel a low threshold for standardized orthostatic measurement and, when indicated, tilt or autonomic evaluations to unmask the diagnosis and inform risk mitigation [^113iw1gF] [^114nQSqq] [^113K4VHQ] [^113X16Sj].

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) presents with **dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, and syncope** upon standing, typically resolving with recumbency [^113612CJ]. Symptoms typically begin **within 3 minutes of standing** [^112DCV2o], worsen in the morning or after meals [^117K1NdP], and may include "coat-hanger" neck/shoulder pain [^113612CJ], cognitive slowing [^111HBx54], or orthostatic dyspnea [^111s41GT]. Many patients, especially older adults, are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms; therefore, routine orthostatic BP measurement is essential [^113K4VHQ] [^113X16Sj]. OH increases fall risk [^113X16Sj] and can cause injuries, particularly in the elderly [^117F3Csr].

---

## Typical symptoms

- **Dizziness and lightheadedness**: Common and often the earliest symptoms [^111s41GT] upon standing.

- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision or visual "graying out" due to transient cerebral hypoperfusion [^113612CJ].

- **Weakness and fatigue**: Generalized weakness, fatigue, or leg buckling on standing [^115EHL5J].

- **Syncope or presyncope**: Transient loss of consciousness or near-fainting episodes [^112X4rJU].

- **Coat-hanger pain**: Neck and shoulder discomfort from muscle hypoperfusion [^113612CJ].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Difficulty concentrating, slowed thinking, or confusion when upright [^111s41GT] [^111HBx54].

- **Orthostatic dyspnea**: Shortness of breath on standing [^111s41GT].

---

## Atypical symptoms

Atypical manifestations may include **headache and chest pain** [^113612CJ] that mimic angina, particularly in patients with autonomic dysfunction [^111s41GT]. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as **nausea, abdominal discomfort, or early satiety** occur, particularly in neurogenic OH [^117AT4jJ]. Psychiatric symptoms, including **anxiety and depression**, may coexist with or be exacerbated by OH [^1136cjLN].

---

## Symptom timing and triggers

- **Timing**: Symptoms typically occur within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt [^113612CJ] [^112DCV2o].

- **Morning predominance**: Symptoms are often worse in the morning due to overnight fluid redistribution [^117K1NdP].

- **Postprandial exacerbation**: Large meals, especially carbohydrate-rich, can worsen symptoms [^112rSTnM] [^111iAPaY].

- **Heat exposure**: Warm environments or hot showers can trigger symptoms [^112rSTnM].

- **Physical exertion**: Exercise or prolonged standing can precipitate symptoms [^113612CJ] [^115w65E6].

## Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension

A significant proportion of patients, particularly older adults, may have **asymptomatic OH**, detected only by routine orthostatic BP measurement [^113K4VHQ] [^113X16Sj]. Asymptomatic OH is clinically important because it increases the risk of **falls, fractures, and cardiovascular events** [^113K4VHQ] [^113rDGxT] [^115EHL5J].

---

## Clinical presentation in specific populations

### Elderly patients

In older adults, OH is **common** [^115w65E6] and frequently asymptomatic or presents with atypical symptoms [^113K4VHQ]. OH significantly increases the risk of falls, fractures, and functional decline [^113rDGxT]. It is often associated with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases [^111HBx54].

---

### Patients with neurodegenerative disorders

In Parkinson's disease, OH is a **common non-motor symptom** [^112rSTnM] that may present early in the disease course [^115Ys43s]. In multiple system atrophy, OH is a hallmark feature, often severe and associated with autonomic failure [^115YK7rC]. In pure autonomic failure, OH is a primary manifestation and is typically accompanied by other autonomic symptoms [^111s41GT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Orthostatic blood pressure measurement**: Supine BP after 5 minutes rest, then standing BP at 1 and 3 minutes; OH is defined as a ≥ 20 mmHg systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg diastolic drop within 3 minutes [^113612CJ] [^112X4rJU].

- **Head-up tilt table testing**: Useful when bedside testing is inconclusive or unsafe [^113612CJ] [^113MytTA].

- **Autonomic function tests**: Valsalva maneuver, heart rate variability, and catecholamine measurements to differentiate neurogenic from non-neurogenic OH [^1156ADPY] [^115f5hXG].

### Orthostatic hypotension: A practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms are due to inadequate physiologic compensation and organ hypoperfusion and include headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in all age groups. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality.

Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which consists of blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or if the clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended. Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or non-neurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^111s41GT]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

According to consensus guidelines, orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt. Since the magnitude of blood pressure drop also depends on baseline values, it was suggested that a drop of 30 mmHg may be a more appropriate criterion for OH in patients with supine hypertension. Blood pressure is a clinical measure, and the patients are not necessarily aware of its dysregulation. The prevalence of OH increases with age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and pure autonomic failure (PAF). In the general aged population, the prevalence rates of OH range between 5 and 30%.

- **Estimated prevalence of OH in different autonomic disorders**: Symptoms upon postural challenge include dizziness, visual disturbances, presyncope, and syncope. However, the majority of patients experience more subtle general complaints, such as tiredness, impaired cognitive performance, weakness, fatigue, leg buckling, visual blurring, and orthostatic dyspnea. Patients may also experience discomfort in the head, neck, shoulders, or the chest. The latter may be reminiscent of anginal pain in the absence of coronary heart disease. Symptoms are usually persistent but can vary in intensity.

### Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension and risk of falls in community-dwelling older people [^113K4VHQ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Many older people with orthostatic hypotension (OH) may not report typical symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness, or unsteadiness. However, the relationships between OH and falls in the absence of typical symptoms are not yet established.

- **Methods**: Continuous orthostatic blood pressure (BP) was measured during active stand using a Finometer at Wave 1 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing in participants aged ≥ 70 years. OH, with and without dizziness, was defined as a sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg at 30, 60, and 90 seconds post-standing. The association between symptoms of dizziness and orthostatic BP was assessed with multi-level mixed-effects linear regression; logistic regression models assessed the longitudinal relationship between OH and falls at 6-year follow-up (Waves 2–5).

- **Results**: Almost 11% (n = 934, mean age 75 years, 51% female) had OH, two-thirds of whom were asymptomatic. Dizziness was not associated with systolic BP drop at 30 (β = 1.54 [-1.27, 4.36]; p = 0.256), 60 (β = 2.64 [-0.19, 5.47]; p = 0.476) or 90 seconds (β = 2.02 [-0.91, 4.95]; p = 0.176) after standing in adjusted models. Asymptomatic OH was independently associated with unexplained falls (odds ratio 2.01 [1.11, 3.65]; p = 0.022) but not explained falls (OR 0.93 [0.53, 1.62]; p = 0.797) during follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Two-thirds of older people with OH did not report typical symptoms of light-headedness. Dizziness or unsteadiness after standing did not correlate with the degree of orthostatic BP drop or recovery. Participants with asymptomatic OH had a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing unexplained falls compared to those without OH.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly: Diagnosis and treatment [^117F3Csr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem among elderly patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While acute orthostatic hypotension is usually secondary to medication, fluid or blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency, chronic orthostatic hypotension is frequently due to altered blood pressure regulatory mechanisms and autonomic dysfunction.

The diagnostic evaluation requires a comprehensive history, including symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, careful blood pressure measurement at various times of the day, and after meals or medications. Laboratory studies should be based upon the initial findings with emphasis on excluding diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, amyloidosis, diabetes, anemia, and vitamin deficiency as the cause.

Whereas asymptomatic patients usually need no treatment, those with symptoms often benefit from a stepped approach with initial nonpharmacological interventions, including avoidance of potentially hypotensive medications and use of physical counter maneuvers. If these measures prove inadequate and the patient remains persistently symptomatic, various pharmacotherapeutic agents can be added, including fludrocortisone, midodrine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and to make the patient as ambulatory as possible rather than trying to achieve arbitrary blood pressure goals. With proper evaluation and management, the occurrence of adverse events, including falls, fracture, functional decline, and myocardial ischemia, can be reduced.

### Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and associated factors among older people with hypertension in northern Ethiopia [^111HBx54]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and symptomatic hypotension is itself associated with morbidity or cardiovascular mortality. In our study, 35 out of 57 participants (61.4%) with OH reported experiencing symptoms. Common symptoms of symptomatic OH include, but are not limited to, lightheadedness, weakness or tiredness, difficulties in thinking or concentrating, blurred vision, pre-syncope, and syncope. These symptoms can adversely impact the quality of life and may be incapacitating in some cases. However, there is a poor relationship between the magnitude of the orthostatic blood pressure (BP) fall and the degree of symptoms.

The proportion of symptomatic OH varies across studies depending on the method used to assess symptoms. For instance, a previous study found that OH symptoms were present in 25.6% of older patients with hypertension in primary care. In our study, a third of participants with OH did not report any symptoms, which is consistent with previous work. A study using the same tool we used (the OHQ) revealed that 57% reported symptoms of orthostatic intolerance when standing; 55% reported these symptoms after physical activity, consistent with our findings.

- **Limitations**: This was an institution-based study and did not include a random sample of community-dwelling older people with hypertension. Therefore, our sample may not accurately represent the older population in the community. As symptoms were actively queried, our results may have overestimated the recognition of symptoms, resulting in information bias.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common yet often overlooked disorder with numerous causes. It is associated with debilitating symptoms like falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and an increased risk of death. Chronic OH, a primary indicator of autonomic dysfunction, becomes more prevalent with age and is commonly linked to neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure.

Management generally involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to diagnosing the underlying causative factors of OH, treating any related conditions, and providing tailored pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. We propose an innovative, streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH. Additionally, we review the association between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH, discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage, and offer diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision-making and patient care.

We aim to identify gaps in current knowledge and define future research directions. Employing a case-based learning approach, we present specific clinical scenarios illustrating various manifestations of OH. These scenarios serve as a practical guide for evaluating and managing patients with OH.

### Orthostatic hypertension: A newcomer among the hypertension phenotypes [^111X7gFF]. Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the upright posture is recommended by all hypertension guidelines to detect orthostatic hypotension, especially in elderly patients. However, a number of studies have shown that an exaggerated BP response to standing (RTS) is often present in the general population and that it may be of clinical value. For years, the prognostic role and clinical significance of orthostatic hypertension (OHT) remained undefined because data were sparse and often inconsistent. In addition, diagnostic criteria of OHT varied from study to study, making it difficult to interpret data regarding the cardiovascular risk associated with this condition.

In recent years, evidence has been accumulating that OHT is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, hypertension-mediated organ damage, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, increasing our knowledge of the pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and prognostic role of this condition. This led some authorities to propose a definition based on both the orthostatic pressor response and the absolute BP levels while standing. Most information on OHT comes from studies performed in elderly subjects, whereas much less is known about its prevalence and clinical significance in young individuals. The aim of the present review is to summarize the available evidence regarding the prevalence, reproducibility, diagnosis, pathogenetic mechanisms, and risk of adverse outcomes associated with OHT, focusing on potential differences related to age.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope. However, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management.

- **Potential causes of syncope**:
	- Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common cause, characterized by a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.
	- Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be clinically differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolaemia) by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls.
	- Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. It increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115f5hXG]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal orthostatic hypotension (OH) in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps: conducting extended at-home blood pressure monitoring with results recorded by the patient or caregiver, implementing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the patient can annotate times when supine or standing (to determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations), or using autonomic function tests. Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than 3 minutes of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures or prolonged tilt table testing (HUT).

- **Specialty testing**: The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders. Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) include autonomic reflex testing (including heart rate variability to paced breathing, heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver, and continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT). Other tests used to help diagnose nOH may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing.

These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112rSTnM]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, particularly in managing autonomic dysfunction, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend the following general measures for orthostatic hypotension:

- **Avoid aggravating factors**: Large meals, alcohol, exposure to a warm environment, and drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension (e.g. diuretics or antihypertensive drugs) should be avoided. It is important to recognize that levodopa and dopamine agonists may also worsen orthostatic hypotension.

- **Increase salt intake**: This is advised in cases of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Ensure head-up tilt of the bed at night**: This can help mitigate symptoms.

- **Wear elastic stockings**: These can provide support and help in managing orthostatic hypotension.

- **Recognize postprandial hypotension in some patients**: Patients should be warned about this effect and advised to take frequent small meals.

### Rhofade [^116K9nD8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Alpha-adrenergic agonists as a class may impact blood pressure. Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension to seek medical care if their condition worsens. Use with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome and advise patients to seek medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma develop.

- **Potential impacts on cardiovascular disease**: Alpha-adrenergic agonists may impact blood pressure. RHOFADE cream should be used with caution in patients with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension. Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension/hypotension to seek immediate medical care if their condition worsens.

- **Potentiation of vascular insufficiency**: RHOFADE cream should be used with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop.

- **Risk of angle closure glaucoma**: RHOFADE cream may increase the risk of angle closure glaucoma in patients with narrow-angle.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension/neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH/nOH) when compared to the normal population. For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals.

- **Screening for OH/nOH**: A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered at risk for OH/nOH, and a more complete evaluation, including orthostatic vital signs, needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10: "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing and do they get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

*Any positive response should prompt further investigation with orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid hypovolaemia: a therapeutic dilemma [^113LR38E]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is characterized by orthostatic headaches in conjunction with reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and characteristic imaging findings. We report the clinical course of six consecutive patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who were followed between 4 months and 2.5 years. The characteristic orthostatic headaches were present in five patients. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evident in all cases. CSF detected elevated protein content in three of six patients. In only two of our six patients, a first epidural blood patch resulted in complete symptom resolution lasting 4 months and 1 year.

Four patients received a second epidural blood patch and one patient also received a third. In four patients, follow-up brain MRI revealed the re-occurrence of the typical MRI features, and all of them suffered from orthostatic symptoms at this time. Only four patients are free of complaints after an average follow-up period of 10 months. Symptom relief within 7 days from an epidural blood patch is accepted to be diagnostic for spontaneous intracranial hypotension. However, our data illustrate that the clinical course of the syndrome is very unstable, and the epidural blood patch is less effective than widely accepted.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: The role of radiology in diagnosis and management [^116TU6XT]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a condition resulting from the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spine. It typically presents with debilitating orthostatic headache but can be associated with a wide range of other symptoms. The causes of spontaneous CSF leaks leading to SIH include dural tears, leaking meningeal diverticula, and CSF-venous fistulas. Imaging plays a central role in the initial diagnosis of SIH and in its subsequent investigation and management. This article reviews the typical neuroimaging manifestations of SIH and discusses the utility of different myelographic techniques for localizing spinal CSF leaks, as well as the role of image-guided treatment.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^111JYUVe]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

The EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend the following steps in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected orthostatic hypotension:

- **Structured history taking**: This involves a comprehensive assessment of the patient's medical history to understand symptoms and potential causes.

- **Detailed physical examination**: Conduct a thorough physical examination to identify any physical signs that may indicate orthostatic hypotension.

- **Supine and upright blood pressure measurements**: Measure blood pressure in both supine and upright positions to detect any significant drops that confirm orthostatic hypotension.

- **12-lead ECG recording**: Perform an electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart's electrical activity and identify any cardiac issues.

- **Active standing or head-up tilt**: This should ideally include a continuous assessment of blood pressure and heart rate over a period of 3 minutes to observe any immediate physiological changes when the patient changes posture.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here, along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### The Movement Disorders task force review of dysautonomia rating scales in Parkinson's disease with regard to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension [^1125Rsf6]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a blood pressure fall of > 20 mm Hg systolic and/or 10 mm Hg diastolic within 3 minutes of an upright position. The Movement Disorders Society commissioned a task force to assess existing clinical rating scales addressing symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's disease. Seven neurologists and a clinimetrician assessed each scale's previous use and critiqued its clinimetric properties.

A scale was "recommended" if it had been applied to populations of patients with Parkinson's disease, with data on its use in studies beyond the group that developed the scale, and was found to be clinimetrically valid. A scale was considered "suggested" if it had been applied to Parkinson's disease, but only one of the other criteria was applied. A scale was "listed" if it met only one criterion.

Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are generally assessed in scales on wider autonomic or nonmotor symptoms. Some scales designed to detect orthostatic hypotension-related symptoms provide information on their severity. The AUTonomic SCale for Outcomes in PArkinson's Disease and the COMPosite Autonomic Symptom Scale met criteria for recommended with some limitations. The Novel Non-Motor Symptoms Scale and the Orthostatic Grading Scale were classified as suggested. The Self-completed Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire for Parkinson's Disease was classified as suggested as a tool for screening orthostatic symptoms. However, these and the listed scales need further validation and application before they can be recommended for clinical use in patients with Parkinson's disease.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) presents a critical challenge for clinicians. It is essential to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when managing patients with nOH. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is linked to the loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Consequently, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically exhibit both nOH and supine hypertension. Additionally, many medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Since orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, addressing one can worsen the other. Therefore, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension.

There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some may not treat nOH due to fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent significant health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations apply to multiple system atrophy. However, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### Tasmar [^112jTzKe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease patients has been associated with orthostatic hypotension. Tolcapone enhances levodopa bioavailability and, therefore, may increase the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. In TASMAR clinical trials, orthostatic hypotension was documented at least once in 8%, 14%, and 13% of the patients treated with placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg TASMAR tid, respectively. A total of 2%, 5%, and 4% of the patients treated with placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg TASMAR tid, respectively, reported orthostatic symptoms at some time during their treatment and also had at least one episode of orthostatic hypotension documented; however, the episode of orthostatic symptoms itself was invariably not accompanied by vital sign measurements. Patients with orthostasis at baseline were more likely than patients without symptoms to have orthostatic hypotension during the study, irrespective of treatment group. In addition, the effect was greater in tolcapone-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Baseline treatment with dopamine agonists or selegiline did not appear to increase the likelihood of experiencing orthostatic hypotension when treated with TASMAR. Approximately 0.7% of the patients treated with TASMAR (5% of patients who were documented to have had at least one episode of orthostatic hypotension) eventually withdrew from treatment due to adverse events presumably related to hypotension.

In controlled phase 3 trials, approximately 5%, 4%, and 3% of tolcapone 200 mg tid, 100 mg tid, and placebo patients, respectively, reported adverse events.

### Orthostatic hypotension among outpatients with ischemic stroke [^114oJhNn]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is an essential component of stroke prevention; however, the clinical management of patients with cerebrovascular disease is complicated by orthostatic hypotension (OH). The primary objectives were to determine the prevalence of OH in a stroke outpatient clinic, describe categories of OH, and identify factors independently associated with the presence of OH.

- **Methods**: Veterans with stroke cared for in a multidisciplinary stroke clinic were included. OH was defined as a ≥ 20 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure (BP), a ≥ 10 mmHg fall in diastolic BP, or a ≥ 10 mmHg fall in systolic BP with symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with OH, including demographics, comorbidities, stroke severity, and baseline BP.

- **Results**: Among 60 patients with stroke, 16 (27%) exhibited OH. Among those with OH, half were hypertensive, seven were normotensive, and one was hypotensive. A history of coronary artery disease was independently associated with the presence of OH.

- **Conclusions**: Orthostatic hypotension is present in about one quarter of outpatients with stroke, and coronary artery disease appears to be a risk factor. Stroke patients should be screened for OH given that the presence of positional BP changes may alter clinical management.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, occurring with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. It is diagnosed based on an orthostatic challenge and is characterized by a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age-dependent, ranging from 5% in patients 70 years of age. OH may complicate the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. It can cause disabling symptoms, fainting, traumatic injuries, and substantially reduce quality of life.

Despite being largely asymptomatic or presenting with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate challenges and future perspectives.

### Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic disorders in the hypertension clinic [^1151Afwy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertension specialists are often consulted regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) or the combination of OH with supine hypertension. These clinical presentations are frequently associated with various underlying autonomic disorders. A comprehensive medical history and clinical examination, with attention to autonomic signs and the neurological system, may suggest possible etiologies or a differential diagnosis. Occasionally, drug therapy for hypertension or other diseases like Parkinson's is temporally associated with the onset of OH, while in other instances, no definitive association can be established.

Most hypertension specialists can initiate basic evaluation and treatment. Approaches to treating OH must primarily aim to alleviate symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, while also being cognizant of supine hypertension. Several lifestyle and drug therapies can ameliorate symptoms of OH, and short-acting antihypertensive therapy may be useful in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112DCV2o]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, more specifically concerning diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^115s3fpu]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostasis is a frequent trigger for (pre)syncope, but some forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope have a worse prognosis than others. Routine assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (BP) in the emergency department (ED) can detect classic orthostatic hypotension but often misses these other forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope. This study aimed to determine the frequency of abnormal orthostatic BP recovery patterns in patients with (pre)syncope by using continuous non-invasive BP monitoring.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study on suspected patients with (pre)syncope in the ED of a tertiary care teaching hospital between January and August 2014. Orthostatic BP was measured during the active lying-to-standing test with Nexfin, a continuous non-invasive finger arterial pressure measurement device. Orthostatic BP recovery patterns were defined as normal BP recovery, initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed BP recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and reflex-mediated hypotension.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients recruited, measurements in 111 patients (age 63 years, 51% male) were suitable for analysis. Classic orthostatic hypotension was the most prevalent abnormal BP pattern (19%), but only half of the patients received a final diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Initial orthostatic hypotension and delayed BP recovery were present in 20% of the patients with (pre)syncope, of whom 45% were diagnosed with unexplained syncope. Reflex-mediated hypotension was present in 4% of the patients.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous non-invasive BP measurement can potentially identify more specific and concerning causes of (pre)syncope.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SJYoy]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older, particularly when measured continuously, highlighting the need to screen and diagnose initial OH. Future research should investigate whether the inclusion of symptoms in the definition of initial OH is clinically relevant. Furthermore, there is a need to establish a consensus on the diagnosis of initial OH using continuous blood pressure devices to consistently identify participants with initial OH.

### Forteo [^114fcx6F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Forteo should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of Forteo in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved without treatment within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity**: Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because Forteo transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when Forteo is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in long covid clinic patients and healthy volunteers: A multicenter study [^11192MDm]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), is often reported in long COVID, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long COVID clinics and healthy volunteers, and to explore associations with OI symptoms and comorbidities. Participants with a diagnosis of long COVID were recruited from eight UK long COVID clinics, and healthy volunteers were recruited from the general population. All participants undertook the standardized National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants' history of typical OI symptoms, such as dizziness and palpitations, before and during the NLT were recorded.

Two hundred seventy-seven long COVID patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or symptoms during NLT. Of these, 10% had asymptomatic OH. One hundred thirty (47%) long COVID patients had a previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. Forty-one (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS, and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. When relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive abnormal readings to one abnormal reading during the NLT, 11% of long COVID participants (an additional 4%) met the criteria for PoTS, which was not observed in healthy volunteers. More than half of long COVID patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT, and more than one in 10 patients met the criteria for e

### Mirapex [^115LwrAS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Symptomatic hypotension is a concern when using dopamine agonists, which, in clinical studies and experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, causing orthostatic hypotension, particularly during dose escalation. Patients with Parkinson's disease seem to have a decreased ability to respond to orthostatic challenges. Therefore, both Parkinson's disease and RLS patients receiving dopaminergic agonists require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension during dose escalation and should be informed of this risk (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).

In clinical trials of pramipexole, despite showing orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, particularly at the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is unexpected considering the previous experiences with dopamine agonist therapy risks.

This finding could indicate a unique property of pramipexole, but it might also be explained by study conditions and the nature of the enrolled population. Patients were carefully titrated, and those with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. Additionally, clinical trials in RLS patients did not include orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring.

### Igalmi [^114TkoQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Igalmi causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension (defined as SBP decrease ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP decrease ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing) at 2 hours post-dose. In those studies, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced HR ≤ 50 beats per minute within 2 hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In clinical studies with Igalmi, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics, or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension. Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously (Igalmi is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use).

Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported after administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when this product was given by rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Rexulti, cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus ADT in adult patients with MDD, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients included: dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%).

In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients included: dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%).

In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to patients treated with placebo included: dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration or hypovolemia, and those receiving concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medication. Patients with known cardiovascular disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, should also be monitored.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115DQAx7]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission that is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems such as the bowel and the bladder. In the present review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Neurological update: Non-motor symptoms in atypical parkinsonian syndromes [^113LDpg6]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), with greater degrees of dysfunction at baseline being associated with phenoconversion from RBD to Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Urinary symptoms and orthostatic hypotension, the two most common symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, are also listed as part of the diagnostic criteria for Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). We noted a greater prevalence of urinary dysfunction (not limited to urinary incontinence) in patients with MSA (79.7%) or Parkinson's Disease (PD) (79.9%), compared to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) (49.3%), DLB (42%), or Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) (53.8%) (p < 0.001).

- **Orthostatic hypotension prevalence**: This symptom was observed in 27.8% of patients with PD attending a specialist clinic (orthostatic drop > 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure).

These findings underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing non-motor symptoms in managing atypical parkinsonian syndromes.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of nOH in individuals who screen positive for OH is critical. After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Diagnostic tests for nOH**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 minute and 3 minutes after standing.

### Common syndromes of orthostatic intolerance [^114ZmB6w]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps are essential components for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to upright posture (orthostasis). Patients lacking sufficient blood volume or having defective sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction develop orthostatic hypotension (OH), prohibiting effective upright activities. OH is one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI), defined by signs such as hypotension and symptoms such as lightheadedness that occur when upright and are relieved by recumbence.

Mild OI is commonly experienced during illnesses and when standing up rapidly. The latter is denoted "initial OH" and represents a normal cardiovascular adjustment to the blood volume shifts during standing. Some people experience episodic acute OI, such as postural vasovagal syncope (fainting), or chronic OI, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, which can significantly reduce quality of life. The lifetime incidence of one or more fainting episodes is approximately 40%. For the most part, these episodes are benign and self-limited; however, frequent syncope episodes can be debilitating, and injury may occur from sudden falls.

In this article, mechanisms for OI having components of adrenergic hypofunction, adrenergic hyperfunction, hyperpnea, and regional blood volume redistribution are discussed. Therapeutic strategies to cope with OI are proposed.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of Vraylar and was not more frequent with Vraylar than with placebo. Syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and those receiving concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), patients with known cardiovascular disease (such as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. Vraylar has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Vraylar, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, Vraylar may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the threshold for seizures.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically in relation to orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is an asymptomatic fall in SBP from baseline value ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg. This suspicion should be particularly considered when symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension are present from the patient's history.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure upon standing, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes, even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements.

Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualized, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to managing orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure maneuvers), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^111bb6qd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It is only recently that delayed BP recovery has been recognized as a cause of unexplained falls and (pre)syncope and has been associated with similar short-term and long-term risks as classic orthostatic hypotension. In the present syncope guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology and by ACC/AHA/HRS, delayed BP recovery, as a variant of orthostatic hypotension, is not mentioned. In our population, 43% of the patients with delayed BP recovery were classified as unexplained syncope. Compared with those with classic orthostatic hypotension, patients with delayed BP recovery were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, and had a higher admission rate. Delayed BP recovery can be seen as a physical sign of subclinical impaired physiology. Therefore, we suggest that (older) patients presenting to the ED with a history of orthostatic (pre)syncope shortly after standing up, but with a negative oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement, be referred to a syncope unit to detect the underlying cause.

Initial orthostatic hypotension was present in eight (7%) patients in our study. This is a common (3%–10%) but unrecognized cause of syncope usually seen in younger patients. The clinical diagnosis is based on a typical history of (pre)syncope directly on standing and no classic orthostatic hypotension during oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement. The diagnosis becomes 100% certain with detection of initial orthostatic hypotension during continuous non-invasive BP measurement and recognizable symptoms. Recognition by the physician is important because management is simple and effective.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^114d7mkK]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of syncope, particularly concerning diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome when there is an orthostatic heart rate increase (greater than 30 bpm or more than 120 bpm within 10 minutes of active standing) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, thereby reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^116utAaW]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to provide effect sizes of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension in terms of incident fracture risk in the population. A correlation between cardiovascular instability, hypotension, and fractures has been previously demonstrated, suggesting that fractures due to low-energy trauma (falling from a standing height or less) may serve as a valid surrogate marker for syncope and blood pressure instability. In a previous study of individuals aged 50 and above, the prospective risk of fracture associated with delayed BP recovery was 7%. As only 5–10% of falls lead to a fracture, we believe our study, examining incident fractures as an outcome, provides additional clinically relevant information since previous studies on syncope and orthostatic hypotension have only investigated falls as an outcome. Thus, studying the risk of fracture due to falls is highly relevant, as falls are the single strongest risk factor for fracture, suggesting that the focus in fracture prevention may benefit from a shift from osteoporosis to falls.

In 90% of cases in the elderly, femoral fractures are preceded by a fall. Unexplained falls commonly lead to hospitalisations and increased healthcare costs, and over 33% of falls at orthopaedic wards are unexplained. A previous study found that 25% of adults aged above 50 years presenting to the emergency department due to a fall had symptoms suggestive of syncope or an unexplained fall. In addition, nearly 20% of individuals above 70 years with…

### Hypotension unawareness in profound orthostatic hypotension [^112zpMwa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians depend on the history given by patients when considering the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: Patients with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 60 mm Hg from baseline during a head-up tilt table test were included. They were classified according to their symptoms during the head-up tilt table test. The localization of the cause of orthostatic hypotension was sought in each of these groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight (43%) patients had typical symptoms, 49 (24%) had atypical symptoms, and 68 (33%) were asymptomatic. The average decrease in systolic blood pressure was 88 mm Hg, 87.5 mm Hg, and 89.8 mm Hg in the typical, atypical, and asymptomatic groups, respectively (P = 0.81). Patients reported severe dizziness with a similar frequency as lower extremity discomfort. Backache and headache were also common atypical complaints. Patients with a peripheral cause of dysautonomia were able to sustain the longest upright position during the head-up tilt table test (21 minutes, compared to central dysautonomia [15 minutes]) (P = 0.005). There was no correlation between the cause of dysautonomia and the occurrence of symptoms during the head-up tilt table test (P = 0.58).

- **Conclusion**: A third of the patients with severe orthostatic hypotension are completely asymptomatic during the head-up tilt table test, and another quarter have atypical complaints that would not lead physicians toward the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. These findings suggest that they might not provide adequate information in diagnosing profound orthostatic hypotension.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^113rDGxT]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Our study results indicate that syncope and orthostatic hypotension are two factors that may be overlooked during fracture prevention. During the last decade, falls clinics have been implemented on a small scale. Falls clinics and syncope units constitute an important tool in the management of unexplained falls, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension. Although large randomised studies are currently lacking, our findings support the importance of implementing multidisciplinary teams with falls and syncope specialists. In addition, general preventive efforts against fracture and fall should be undertaken, for example, restrictive use of medications known to increase fall risk (e.g. antihypertensive and psychotropic drugs), implementation of home hazard reduction (e.g. rails, nonslip mats, the use of shoes with nonslip soles), and tailored exercise programmes improving mobility and quality of life. Lifestyle changes with proper nutrition are also essential, since nutritional status is an independent predictor of falls in older people living in the community.

The observed increased risk of incident fractures in individuals with orthostatic hypotension compared with syncope in the present study may result from possible concomitant diseases such as Parkinson's disease or dementia, which are well-established factors associated with postural instability and gait dysfunction that may lead to an increased risk for falls and injuries. Although such investigations are beyond the scope of this study, further research is warranted.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112X4rJU]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, more specifically with respect to the orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline value of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Symptom recognition is impaired in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^113iw1gF]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Failure to recognize symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) may result in falls, syncope, and injuries. The relationship between orthostatic changes in blood pressure and symptom occurrence and severity is not known. The goal of the present study was to define the relationship between the occurrence and severity of the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and (1) the upright systolic blood pressure (SBP) and (2) the fall in SBP after tilting in patients with OH. We prospectively studied 89 patients with OH.

Reported BP values include the lowest BP in the first 3 minutes of tilt and the change in blood pressure during tilt. Subjects were queried about symptoms of orthostatic intolerance while supine and during the first 3 minutes of tilt testing using Question 1 of the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire. Mean tilted SBP was 101.6 ± 26.1 mm Hg and mean SBP fall 47.9 ± 18.1 mm Hg. Mean symptom scores when upright were: light-headedness (2.3/10 ± 2.7), dizziness (1.6/10 ± 2.5), and impending blackout (0.8/10 ± 1.9).

The majority of patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and no discrete cutoff for symptoms was observed. The magnitude of the SBP fall (r = -0.07, P = NS) and the lowest upright SBP (r = 0.08, P = NS) did not correlate with any reported symptom. These results suggest a poor relationship between the magnitude of the orthostatic BP fall, the upright orthostatic BP, and symptoms. Many patients are asymptomatic despite substantial SBP falls and low orthostatic blood pressures. These findings have implications for the clinical care of patients with OH.

### Orthostatic hypotension and risk of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults [^1137zWaX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Requests for the data, analytic methods, and study materials used in this study for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure may be submitted to the ARIC Study publications committee.

- **Study population**: The ARIC Study is a prospective cohort that enrolled 15,792 adults, aged 45 to 64 years, between 1987 and 1989 from four US communities. Participants have been followed for over 2 decades. The original ARIC Study protocol included physical examinations, medical interviews, and laboratory tests. In this analysis, we excluded the following:
	(1) participants who did not have an OH assessment at baseline (1987–1989) because of late implementation of this protocol (N = 2555);
	(2) participants who had a history of CHD (N = 766), HF (N = 752), or stroke (N = 284);
	(3) participants who were missing relevant covariate data at baseline as well as underrepresented racial groups (N = 3222); or
	(4) those who were missing measurement or follow-up data for outcomes of interest (N = 4094).
	- This resulted in a study population of 9139 participants (some participants met multiple exclusion criteria). History of CHD was based on ECGs (silent MI), self-report, or self-reported history of previous coronary procedures. History of HF was defined as active use of medications to treat HF or self-reported symptoms associated with HF on the basis of the Gothenburg criteria. History of stroke was based on self-report. We excluded participants with self-reported CHD, congestive heart failure, or stroke to study a population without known CVD to assess the association.

### Management of hypertension in the setting of autonomic failure: A pathophysiological approach [^115dZAAz]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We discuss two cases presenting clinically with disabling orthostatic hypotension and severe supine hypertension. This is a common presentation of autonomic failure and poses challenges to conventional treatment. In the first case, the clinical findings of isolated autonomic failure were the most prominent manifestation, whereas a movement disorder was the key finding in the second case.

The differential diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension is examined from a pathophysiological perspective. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of disorders of the autonomic nervous system is fundamental for the effective management of these patients and provides insight into more common disorders, such as essential hypertension.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with orthostatic intolerance [^112qcyg6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

The term orthostatic intolerance describes symptoms of hemodynamic instability such as lightheadedness, fatigue, impaired cognition, and syncope that develop upon assuming an upright posture. Common forms of orthostatic intolerance in childhood include postural tachycardia syndrome and neurally mediated hypotension.

- **Objective**: A descriptive report of the clinical characteristics of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms who are ultimately found to have orthostatic intolerance.

- **Methods**: A medical record review of all patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center who had an abnormal tilt table test between June 1996 and December 2000.

- **Results**: Of 24 eligible subjects aged 9–17 years (mean, 14.3 years), four had postural tachycardia syndrome, eight had both postural tachycardia and neurally mediated hypotension, and 12 had neurally mediated hypotension alone. The most common presenting gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The median number of gastrointestinal symptoms per patient was 3 (range, 1–7). Eighty-seven percent of the patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms for more than 1 year, and 48% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms for more than 3 years. Follow-up information was available on 18 patients. Seventy-eight percent of patients (14 of 18) had complete resolution of symptoms with treatment of orthostatic intolerance.

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric patients with chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms may have underlying orthostatic intolerance.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113ze6DC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, particularly in the context of orthostatic rehabilitation, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend considering orthostatic rehabilitation that addresses both deconditioning affecting skeletal muscle and deconditioning affecting autonomic postural responses. This is especially relevant for patients who have been bedbound and exhibit symptoms of orthostatic intolerance or have pre-existing postural tachycardia syndrome and/or hypermobility syndromes.

### Neupro [^113FBVBW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Dopaminergic agonists in clinical studies and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, seem to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk.

An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for NEUPRO and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for NEUPRO and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (NEUPRO incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing.

### Incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation [^117LtRmR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to document the incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and to determine clinical variables associated with it. This cohort study was conducted in the inpatient setting of a tertiary rehabilitation center and involved seventy-one stroke patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.4 ± 10.7 years) who had a first clinical stroke and were admitted for rehabilitation within four weeks of the stroke.

Patients' blood pressure was measured in the supine position and on tilting at 90 degrees within three days of admission. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg or more. Results showed that orthostatic hypotension was present in 37 (52.1%) patients, of whom 13 had severe hypotension (standing SBP, ≤ 100 mmHg). Twelve (32.4%) patients with orthostatic hypotension were positive for hypotensive symptoms and signs, with 2 patients experiencing near syncope.

Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with older patients, a lower admission functional status (as measured on the Modified Barthel Index), and more severe hemiparesis. It was, however, not related to the site of stroke or the use of antihypertensives. On discharge, orthostatic hypotension had resolved in 23 patients. The presence of orthostatic hypotension did not influence functional outcomes or the length of stay in rehabilitation.

In conclusion, orthostatic hypotension was common in stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. It should be suspected in older patients who have orthostatic hypotension-related symptoms.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel, along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition.

The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used but not approved for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### Orthostatic hypotension and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with dizziness [^1136cjLN]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

The present study was undertaken to investigate orthostatic hypotension and psychiatric comorbidity with anxiety and depression in dizzy patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Sixty-three patients with nonspecific dizziness and 27 volunteer subjects were evaluated with the head-up tilt test (HUTT) and the Standardized Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I.

- **Results**: Orthostatic hypotension was induced by HUTT in 44% of patients and in 15% of volunteers (P = 0.0082); we found that the incidence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher (P < .05) in patients with nonspecific dizziness than in controls. Orthostatic hypotension was related to age but not to antihypertensive therapy and sex. Dizziness during the HUTT was reported by 49% of patients and 33% of volunteers (P = 0.2469). Among patients, dizziness was found to be related to sex (female) and anxiety. A correlation between dizziness and anxiety was also present in volunteers. Head-up tilt test induced vasovagal reactions in 2 volunteers.

- **Conclusions**: Orthostatic hypotension is present in a high percentage of patients with orthostatic dizziness, and anxiety and depression are an important factor in the onset of dizziness. A high percentage of abnormal responses in volunteer subjects seems to indicate that the HUTT is not indicated for routine use.

### An update on MSA: Premotor and non-motor features open a window of opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention [^115YK7rC]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Early symptoms in multiple system atrophy (MSA) are frequently related to cardiovascular and autonomic failure and precede motor manifestations. In a recent study, the majority of MSA patients (77%) recalled early autonomic symptoms, which were initially not recognized as a manifestation of a neurodegenerative disease.

Criteria for the diagnosis of probable MSA, according to Gilman et al, involve autonomic dysfunction, including urinary incontinence (inability to control the release of urine from the bladder, with erectile dysfunction in males) or orthostatic hypotension (OH) (a decrease in blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing by at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic).

Importantly, autonomic dysfunction may be the only presenting feature in some MSA patients. Symptomatic OH, the main symptom of cardiovascular autonomic failure, often manifests as syncope, dizziness, nausea, headache, and weakness, and has been reported in 43–81% of all MSA patients. Cardiovascular autonomic failure associated with degeneration of the nucleus ambiguus has been reproduced in an MSA mouse model.

- **Differential diagnosis and symptom comparison**:
	Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and its related symptoms, such as light-headedness or dizziness, and sudomotor dysfunction, are the most common presenting features in pure autonomic failure (PAF). Bladder symptoms are also present in some PAF patients, but these features are less severe than in MSA.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^115Ys43s]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving both motor and nonmotor symptoms. The prodromal phase of PD can start as early as 20 years prior to diagnosis and is dominated by nonmotor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder, and hyposmia. Orthostatic hypotension has also been described as a common nonmotor sign of PD, but was typically attributed to a later stage of the disease.

Recent studies have suggested that orthostatic hypotension can develop during the prodromal phase of PD. Determining whether orthostatic hypotension should be considered a prodromal marker of PD is important because prodromal markers allow earlier recognition of PD and could help to identify individuals eligible for neuroprotective trials. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of orthostatic hypotension and other nonmotor symptoms of PD is required because these symptoms negatively impact quality of life.

The association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD has been limitedly studied so far. Some small studies have shown an increased risk of PD in participants with orthostatic hypotension. Additionally, a large registry-based study has demonstrated that participants with hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, carried an increased risk of PD. However, the association between orthostatic hypotension and PD has not been prospectively studied in a large sample of the general population yet.

Thus, we aimed to identify whether orthostatic hypotension in the general population is a…

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^117AT4jJ]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by a failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission, which is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems, such as the bowel and the bladder. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.
