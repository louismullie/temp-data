---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat constipation in a 9-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming functional constipation and excluding organic causes. Then, I should assess for fecal impaction. Next, I will decide on disimpaction if needed, initiate maintenance pharmacotherapy, and layer in nonpharmacologic measures. After that, I need to educate caregivers on chronicity and relapse, set a follow-up plan, and define response criteria with dose adjustments or adjuncts if inadequate. Finally, I should plan for weaning and identify indications for specialist referral and advanced testing if refractory. I will align the plan with ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2014 and relevant pediatric data to ensure guideline concordance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis clinically and rule out red flags pointing to organic disease. I initially almost said "use Rome III", but wait, let me verify the current pediatric criteria: for children, we should use Rome IV features such as ≤ 2 stools/week, painful or hard stools, fecal incontinence, large-diameter stools, or stool withholding, assessed by history and supported by physical exam, which in most cases is sufficient to diagnose functional constipation without routine testing [^111yRL2V] [^111uALz2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — red flags like failure to thrive, delayed meconium, bilious vomiting, blood in stool not explained by fissures, severe abdominal distension, neurologic deficits, or fever should prompt targeted workup; for suspected Hirschsprung disease, I should confirm with rectal biopsy rather than delay definitive testing [^117Qe2uu] [^113ahbKo]. I need to ensure the exam includes growth, abdominal, perianal, and lumbosacral inspection; a digital rectal exam is reserved for uncertain diagnosis, alarm features, or intractable constipation — so I should avoid performing it routinely, and if I first thought it was standard in all cases, I should correct that assumption now [^117SHSuP] [^117L9iEf].

> Next, I should review what not to order routinely. I need to check my impulse to obtain an abdominal radiograph; interobserver variability is high and routine AXR adds little diagnostic value in childhood constipation, so it should not be part of a standard workup absent specific indications [^113hGTaF]. I should double-check advanced studies: colonic transit testing is not for routine diagnosis of functional constipation but may help differentiate functional constipation from nonretentive fecal incontinence when diagnosis remains unclear, and anorectal or colonic manometry are reserved for intractable cases; MRI of the spine is not indicated unless there are neurologic abnormalities on exam [^115APmt4] [^115PZQxC] [^117T6FY9].

> I will now examine for fecal impaction because treatment must start with disimpaction if present. Let me consider the first-line regimen and verify dosing: oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days is recommended for disimpaction; if PEG is unavailable, a daily enema for 3–6 days is an acceptable alternative [^116PvxSt] [^117S8sWn]. I should confirm that we complete disimpaction before moving to maintenance, because skipping this step risks ongoing withholding and treatment failure [^116PvxSt].

> Once disimpaction is complete — or if there was no impaction — I should initiate maintenance therapy with PEG. Wait, I need to check the starting dose and titration: begin PEG (with or without electrolytes) at 0.4 g/kg/day and titrate to achieve one soft stool per day or at least three per week with minimal straining; maintain attention to safety, which is favorable overall, with consideration of electrolyte monitoring in patients at risk for water–electrolyte imbalance [^117V8iu6] [^113Ssx4s]. If PEG is not available, lactulose is an acceptable first-line alternative; I should not add routine enemas to chronic PEG use, and I should note that secretagogues and prokinetics like lubiprostone, linaclotide, and prucalopride are not recommended routinely in pediatric intractable constipation outside specialist guidance; evidence from pediatric RCTs supports PEG's superiority to placebo for maintenance, reinforcing it as first choice [^114E4xjY] [^112spG2f] [^112Nu3TA] [^113gvFBh].

> Now, I should confirm the expected duration of therapy and counsel on chronicity and relapse. The guideline-based minimum is at least 2 months of maintenance, and I should not discontinue until the child has been symptom-free for at least 1 month; this prevents premature cessation and relapse [^1127n1fz]. I need to ensure I set expectations: functional constipation often follows a chronic, relapsing course, with approximately 40–50% experiencing at least one relapse over 5 years and about 30% having persistent symptoms beyond puberty, so families should be prepared for prolonged therapy and intermittent setbacks [^116V1iyB] [^113JwdBM] [^117R4Y3V] [^113rLNUx].

> Concurrently, I will implement nonpharmacologic interventions as essential adjuncts. Let me think about the behavioral plan: for a 9-year-old, scheduled unhurried toilet sitting for about 5 minutes after meals to leverage the gastrocolic reflex, paired with a stool diary and a simple reward system, is recommended together with clear demystification and education for child and caregivers about the condition and expected time course [^117QXMuw]. I should confirm dietary and activity advice: ensure adequate age-appropriate fluid and fiber intake and encourage regular physical activity, but increasing fiber or fluids beyond normal daily recommendations has not shown added benefit, and these measures alone are insufficient to replace laxatives once functional constipation is established [^1162s63N] [^113rLNUx]. Hold on, I should verify what to avoid: do not add intensive protocolized behavioral therapy, biofeedback, or routine pre/probiotics, as these have not demonstrated additional benefit beyond conventional treatment with laxatives and simple behavioral strategies [^113Af4hQ] [^113UwSMP] [^113Tyx9o].

> Next, I should review the follow-up plan and monitoring to maintain momentum and adjust dosing. Close follow-up — via phone, web-based support, or in-person — improves adherence and outcomes; web-based self-management information has shown short-term improvements, likely by reinforcing behaviors and timely dose titration, so I should arrange frequent check-ins early and then space out as control stabilizes [^117AACXW]. I need to check that each visit documents bowel frequency, stool consistency, pain, fecal incontinence, and any withholding behaviors to guide PEG titration and identify early relapse [^1127n1fz].

> If response is inadequate despite appropriate PEG titration, I should reassess and escalate logically. First, I should double-check adherence to medication and the toilet program and verify that PEG was optimized sufficiently; then I can add second-line agents such as magnesium hydroxide, mineral oil, or stimulant laxatives like senna as rescue or adjuncts, recognizing that high-quality pediatric evidence is limited but guideline recommendations support their use when PEG alone is insufficient [^1159AkKu] [^1132GMBr]. But wait, what if I'm still not seeing progress after several months of optimal therapy? That is when I should consider referral to pediatric gastroenterology for evaluation of refractory constipation and potential specialized testing or advanced therapies [^113rLNUx].

> Once symptoms are controlled, I will plan a cautious weaning strategy to minimize relapse risk. I should confirm that de-escalation only begins after the child has been symptom-free for at least 1 month, then reduce the PEG dose by about 10–25% every 2–6 weeks while monitoring for recurrence; if symptoms return, I should revert to the last effective dose and maintain for a further 3–6 months before another attempt, acknowledging that pilot data support the feasibility of structured weaning, particularly from higher doses [^1127n1fz].

> For persistent or intractable cases, I need to ensure timely referral and consider advanced options guided by specialists. Hold on, I should verify the indications: red flags at any time, or constipation persisting despite 3–6 months of optimal therapy, should prompt referral; specialized diagnostics may include anorectal manometry to assess the rectoanal-inhibitory reflex, select use of colonic transit or manometry in refractory cases, and in select patients, consideration of antegrade continence enemas as part of a bowel management program; in truly intractable constipation, broader therapeutic evaluations are informed by emerging evidence but require individualized specialist oversight [^113rLNUx] [^115PZQxC] [^115APmt4] [^1123b7Du] [^114DbTR2].

> In summary, I should confirm functional constipation clinically and exclude red flags, disimpact first if needed, initiate PEG maintenance with titration, integrate toilet-sitting and education, set expectations about chronicity, follow closely with dose adjustments, add second-line agents if PEG alone is inadequate, plan a gradual wean after sustained control, and refer for refractory disease or red flags; let me double-check that dosing, duration, and escalation steps align with ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN recommendations and supportive pediatric evidence, which they do [^1127n1fz] [^113Ssx4s] [^117V8iu6] [^116PvxSt] [^1159AkKu].

For a 9-year-old with constipation, begin with **PEG 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days** for disimpaction [^116PvxSt] [^113Ssx4s], then maintain with **PEG 0.4 g/kg/day**, titrating to 1–2 soft stools daily [^117V8iu6] [^113gvFBh]. If PEG is unavailable, **use lactulose** [^114E4xjY]; consider magnesium hydroxide or stimulant laxatives if needed [^1159AkKu]. Combine with daily toilet sitting after meals [^117QXMuw], adequate fluids, and age-appropriate fiber [^1162s63N] [^115THCKu]. Continue maintenance for at least **2 months** [^1127n1fz], tapering only after 1 month symptom-free [^113rLNUx]. Refer if **symptoms persist despite therapy** [^113rLNUx] or if red flags are present [^117Qe2uu].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **History and physical examination**: Diagnose functional constipation based on history and physical exam [^111uALz2]; use Rome IV criteria [^111yRL2V].

- **Alarm signs**: Identify red flags suggesting organic disease (e.g. delayed meconium, failure to thrive, neurologic deficits, severe abdominal distension) [^117Qe2uu] [^113rLNUx].

- **Digital rectal examination**: Perform if diagnosis is uncertain [^117L9iEf] or if alarm signs are present [^117SHSuP].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Education and demystification**: Explain the chronic course, need for prolonged therapy, and risk of relapse [^117QXMuw] [^113rLNUx].

- **Toilet training**: Daily toilet sitting after meals with positive reinforcement [^117QXMuw]; avoid intensive behavioral programs [^113Af4hQ] [^116fCabh].

- **Dietary modifications**: Ensure adequate fiber and fluids [^111ahNtv]; avoid routine use of prebiotics/probiotics [^113Tyx9o] [^115THCKu].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Disimpaction (if fecal impaction present)

When fecal impaction is present, **polyethylene glycol (PEG)** 1–1.5 g/kg/day orally for 3–6 days is recommended [^116PvxSt] [^113Ssx4s]; if PEG is unavailable, use enemas once daily for 3–6 days [^117S8sWn].

---

### Maintenance therapy

- **First-line**: PEG 0.4 g/kg/day, titrated to 1–2 soft stools daily [^117V8iu6] [^113gvFBh] [^1132GMBr].

- **Second-line**: Lactulose if PEG unavailable [^114E4xjY] [^112VYuML]; consider magnesium hydroxide, mineral oil, or stimulant laxatives if needed [^1159AkKu] [^114wqysS].

- **Duration**: Continue at least 2 months [^1127n1fz]; taper after 1 month symptom-free [^113rLNUx].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **regular follow-up** to monitor adherence, adjust therapy, and manage relapses [^117AACXW] [^113rLNUx], and provide **family support** by addressing adherence and family dynamics to improve outcomes [^113cYnBN].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Refer for **persistent symptoms despite adequate therapy** or **alarm signs** suggesting organic disease. For refractory constipation, consider anorectal/colonic manometry or surgical options [^115PZQxC] [^1123b7Du] [^114DbTR2].

---

## Prognosis

Long-term outcomes show that 75–80% achieve good outcomes, whereas 25% may have persistent symptoms into adulthood [^117R4Y3V]; **relapse** is common and requires ongoing management and support [^113JwdBM].

---

## Summary table: treatment approach

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Evaluation | History, physical exam, Rome IV criteria, identify alarm signs |
| 2 | Disimpaction | PEG 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days; enemas if PEG unavailable |
| 3 | Maintenance | PEG 0.4 g/kg/day; lactulose or other laxatives if needed |
| 4 | Non-pharmacological | Education, toilet training, dietary modifications |
| 5 | Follow-up | Regular monitoring, adjust therapy, address adherence |
| 6 | Referral | Persistent symptoms, alarm signs, refractory cases |

---

The recommended approach is to **use PEG for disimpaction and maintenance**, with lactulose or other laxatives as needed, alongside education, toilet training, and dietary changes. Continue maintenance for at least **2 months**, taper after 1 month symptom-free, and refer if symptoms persist or alarm signs are present.

### Constipation in children and adolescents: Evaluation and treatment [^113rLNUx]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Constipation in children is usually functional constipation without an organic cause. Organic causes of constipation in children, which include Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord abnormalities, commonly present with red flag signs and symptoms. A history and physical examination can diagnose functional constipation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

- **Management goals**: The first goal of managing constipation is to treat fecal impaction, and then maintenance therapy is used to prevent recurrence. Polyethylene glycol is the first-line treatment for constipation. Second-line options include lactulose and enemas. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake above usual daily recommendations and adding probiotics provide no additional benefits for treating constipation.

- **Support and education**: Frequent follow-up visits and referrals to a psychologist can assist in reaching some treatment goals. Clinicians should educate caregivers about the chronic course of functional constipation, frequent relapses, and the potential for prolonged therapy. Clinicians should acknowledge caregivers' specific challenges and the negative effects of constipation on the child's quality of life.

- **Specialist referral**: Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when there is a concern for organic causes or constipation persists despite adequate therapy.

### Childhood constipation: Longitudinal follow-up beyond puberty [^113JwdBM]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Sparse data exist about the prognosis of childhood constipation and its possible persistence into adulthood.

- **Methods**: A total of 418 constipated patients older than 5 years at intake (279 boys; median age, 8.0 years) participated in studies evaluating therapeutic modalities for constipation. All children subsequently were enrolled in this follow-up study with prospective data collection after an initial 6-week intensive treatment protocol, at 6 months, and thereafter annually, using a standardized questionnaire.

- **Results**: Follow-up was obtained in more than 95% of the children. The median duration of the follow-up period was 5 years (range, 1–8 years). The cumulative percentage of children who were treated successfully during follow-up was 60% at 1 year, increasing to 80% at 8 years. Successful treatment was more frequent in children without encopresis and in children with an age of onset of defecation difficulty older than 4 years. In the group of children treated successfully, 50% experienced at least one period of relapse. Relapses occurred more frequently in boys than in girls (relative risk 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.62). In the subset of children aged 16 years and older, constipation still was present in 30%.

- **Conclusions**: After intensive initial medical and behavioral treatment, 60% of all children referred to a tertiary medical center for chronic constipation were treated successfully at 1 year of follow-up. One third of the children followed-up beyond puberty continued to have severe complaints of constipation. This finding contradicts the initial assumption that symptoms resolve universally with age.

### Treatments for intractable constipation in childhood [^114DbTR2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Constipation that is prolonged and does not resolve with conventional therapeutic measures is called intractable constipation. The treatment of intractable constipation is challenging, involving pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies, as well as surgical approaches. Unresolved constipation can negatively impact quality of life, with additional implications for health systems. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify treatments that are efficacious and safe.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments used for intractable constipation in children.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 23 June 2023. We also searched reference lists of included studies for relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or surgical treatment to placebo or another active comparator, in participants aged between 0 and 18 years with functional constipation who had not responded to conventional medical therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were symptom resolution, frequency of defecation, treatment success, and adverse events; secondary outcomes were stool consistency, painful defecation, quality of life, fecal incontinence frequency, abdominal pain, hospital admission for disimpaction, and school absence. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary outcome.

- **Main results**: This review included 10 RCTs with 1278 children who had intractable constipation.

### Hospital-level variation in practice patterns and patient outcomes for pediatric patients hospitalized with functional constipation [^1171rkVU]. Hospital Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common pediatric condition with a prevalence of 3% to 5% in children aged 4 to 17 years. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for managing pediatric patients hospitalized with constipation. The primary objective was to evaluate practice patterns and patient outcomes for the hospital management of functional constipation in US children's hospitals.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 18 years hospitalized for functional constipation from 2012 to 2014 using the Pediatric Health Information System. Patients were included by using constipation and other related diagnoses as classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. Patients with complex chronic conditions were excluded. Outcome measures included the percentage of hospitalizations due to functional constipation, therapies used, length of stay, and 90-day readmission rates. Statistical analysis included means with 95% confidence intervals for individual hospital outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 14,243 hospitalizations were included, representing 12,804 unique patients. The overall percentage of hospitalizations due to functional constipation was 0.65% (range: 0.19%-1.41%, P < .0001). The percentage of patients receiving the following treatment during their hospitalization included:
	- **Electrolyte laxatives**: 40% to 96%
	- **Sodium phosphate enema**: 0% to 64%
	- **Mineral oil enema**: 0% to 61%
	- **Glycerin suppository**: 0% to 37%
	- **Bisacodyl**: 0% to 47%
	- **Senna**: 0% to 23%
	- **Docusate**: 0% to 11%

The mean length of stay and other relevant data points were analyzed but not fully provided in the text.

### Variability in the management of childhood constipation [^116FDziL]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To assist primary care providers, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published clinical practice guidelines for the management of childhood constipation. A cross-sectional survey of pediatricians from across the United States was conducted to assess pediatricians' constipation management strategies, their familiarity with the NASPGHAN constipation guidelines, and the reasons for referring constipated patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Overall, 75% of pediatricians used polyethylene glycol without electrolytes to treat childhood constipation, 8% were aware that NASPGHAN had published constipation guidelines, and parental pressure was one reason for referring patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist.

### Polyethylene glycol maintenance treatment for childhood functional constipation: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113gvFBh]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) during maintenance treatment of childhood functional constipation (FC) in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Children (2–16 years) with FC according to the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with PEG or placebo for 24 weeks. Children reporting treatment failure before 24 weeks were switched to conventional treatment. The primary outcome was successful treatment, defined as the absence of any Rome III criteria with or without the use of medication after 24 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 102 children were included: PEG/placebo: 49/53. At 24 weeks, significantly more patients in the PEG group, compared to the placebo group, were successfully treated (33 [67%] vs. 19 [36%], hazard ratio [95% confidence intervals] = 3.21 [1.73–5.94]). Significantly fewer children in the PEG group switched to rescue medication (2 [4%] vs. 30 [57%], P < 0.001). The time before the change to rescue medication was 13 and 27 days, respectively, for each of the two children in the PEG group who required rescue medication. The median time to shift to rescue medication was 27 days (range: 3–64 days) in the placebo group. At 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 33 children (67%) in the PEG group were successfully treated, compared to 19 children (32%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [95% confidence intervals] = 3.21 [1.73–5.94]). No serious adverse event related to the use of the medication was registered.

- **Conclusions**: Maintenance treatment with PEG is significantly more effective in the management of childhood functional constipation compared to placebo treatment under the conditions tested.

### Role of polyethylene glycol in the treatment of functional constipation in children [^113Ssx4s]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

According to international guidelines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the laxative of first choice in the treatment of functional constipation in children, both for disimpaction and maintenance treatment. PEG acts as an osmotic laxative, and its efficacy is dose-dependent. It is highly effective, has a good safety profile, and is well tolerated by children. Only minor adverse events have been reported. Overall, the use of PEG in children is considered safe; however, in patients predisposed to water and electrolyte imbalances, monitoring of serum electrolytes should be considered.

### Behavioral therapy for childhood constipation: A randomized, controlled trial [^116fCabh]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Behavioral interventions have been suggested to improve continence in children with functional fecal incontinence associated with constipation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of behavioral therapy combined with laxatives compared to conventional treatment for childhood functional constipation.

In this randomized, controlled trial conducted at a tertiary hospital in The Netherlands, 134 children aged 4 to 18 years with functional constipation were randomly assigned to receive 22 weeks (12 visits) of either behavioral therapy or conventional treatment. The primary outcomes measured were defecation frequency, fecal incontinence frequency, and success rate. Success was defined as having a defecation frequency of three or more times per week and a fecal incontinence frequency of one or fewer times per two weeks, regardless of laxative use. Secondary outcomes included stool-withholding behavior and behavior problems. Outcomes were evaluated at the end of treatment and at a 6-month follow-up. All analyses were conducted by intention to treat.

Defecation frequency was significantly higher for the group receiving conventional treatment. However, fecal incontinence frequency showed no difference between the treatments. After 22 weeks, success rates between conventional treatment (62.3%) and behavioral therapy (51.5%) did not differ, nor did they differ at the 6-month follow-up (57.3% and 42.3%, respectively). The proportion of children withholding stools showed no difference between the interventions.

### Practice patterns of pediatricians and trainees for the management of functional constipation compared with 2006 NASPGHAN guidelines [^111EhrVg]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has formulated guidelines for managing functional constipation. However, there have been no studies investigating how pediatricians apply the constipation guideline since it was revised in 2006. This study aimed to examine how pediatricians approach functional constipation and how closely their approaches adhere to the guidelines.

- **Methods**: An anonymous multiple-choice questionnaire was developed by general pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists. It was distributed to pediatricians and pediatric residents at seven academic institutions, and also to the American Academy of Pediatrics section on medical students, residents, and fellowship trainees mailing list.

- **Results**: A total of 1,202 responses were received (952 trainees, 250 attendings). Of these, 84.3% reported being unfamiliar or slightly familiar with the guidelines. The most common initial interventions for constipation without fecal incontinence included fluids (92.1%), fiber (89.5%), juice (77.7%), behavioral interventions (71.2%), follow-up (53.4%), and reducing constipating foods (50.1%). For constipation with fecal incontinence, the most common initial interventions included bowel cleanout (73.4%), maintenance medication (70.0%), fluids (67.9%), behavioral interventions (67.6%), fiber (66.1%), and follow-up (57.8%). Osmotics were the most commonly prescribed as needed (83.0%) and as maintenance medications (96.8%), with stimulants prescribed PRN by 35.6% and as maintenance by 16.8%.

### Physiotherapy for children with functional constipation: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial in primary care [^111A5wxm]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy plus conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone for treating functional constipation in children aged 4–17 years in primary care.

The study design was a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with 8 months of follow-up. Primary care physicians recruited children diagnosed with functional constipation (n = 234), and pediatricians recruited newly referred children with this diagnosis (n = 11). Conventional treatment comprised toilet training, nutritional advice, and laxative prescribing, whereas physiotherapy focused on resolving dyssynergic defecation. The primary outcome was treatment success over 8 months, defined as the absence of functional constipation (Rome III criteria) without laxative use. Secondary outcomes included the absence of functional constipation irrespective of the continuation of laxative use and the global perceived treatment effect.

Children were allocated to conventional treatment plus physiotherapy or conventional treatment alone (67 per group). The mean (SD) age was 7.6 (3.5) years. Results of longitudinal analyses in the intention-to-treat population showed that the treatment success percentage was not statistically improved by adding physiotherapy to conventional treatment (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.44–1.30). At 4 months, fewer children receiving physiotherapy had treatment success (17%) than children receiving conventional treatment alone (28%), but this had equalized by 8 months (42% and 41%, respectively).

### Assessment and management of pediatric constipation for the primary care clinician [^116V1iyB]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in pediatrics and accounts for 3–5% of all pediatric office visits and 10–25% of all pediatric gastroenterology referrals. Functional constipation accounts for about 95% of constipation cases, but "red flag" symptoms that suggest organic causes need to be considered. A diagnosis of functional constipation can be made in the absence of "red flag" symptoms and a normal physical assessment.

Physical assessment should focus on growth, abdominal examination, inspection of the perianal region, and examination of the lumbosacral region. Abdominal x-rays are generally not useful to differentiate between functional and organic causes of constipation.

Treatment of constipation includes dietary changes, medication use, and behavioral modification. Osmotic laxatives are used as first-line treatment, and stimulant laxatives can be added if there is no improvement with osmotic laxatives. Despite improvement with laxatives, 40–50% of children with constipation experience at least one relapse in five years.

Quality improvement opportunities exist for improving the care of children with functional constipation by specialists partnering with primary care.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments for childhood constipation: Systematic review [^115THCKu]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

To summarize the evidence surrounding nonpharmacologic treatments for childhood constipation, a systematic review was conducted. These treatments include fiber, fluid, physical movement, prebiotics, probiotics, behavioral therapy, multidisciplinary treatment, and forms of alternative medicine.

We systematically searched three major electronic databases and the reference lists of existing reviews, including systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on nonpharmacologic treatments. Two reviewers independently rated the methodological quality.

The review included nine studies with a total of 640 children. Considerable heterogeneity across studies precluded meta-analysis. No RCTs were found for physical movement, multidisciplinary treatment, or alternative medicine. Some evidence suggests that fiber may be more effective than placebo in improving stool frequency and consistency and in reducing abdominal pain. However, compared with normal fluid intake, no evidence was found that increased water intake or hyperosmolar fluid treatment was more effective in increasing stool frequency or decreasing difficulty in passing stools. Additionally, no evidence supports the use of prebiotics or probiotics. Behavioral therapy combined with laxatives does not appear more effective than laxatives alone.

In conclusion, there is some evidence that fiber supplements are more effective than a placebo. However, no evidence supports the effectiveness of fluid supplements, prebiotics, probiotics, or behavioral interventions. There is a lack of well-designed, high-quality RCTs concerning nonpharmacologic treatments for childhood constipation.

### Emergency department diagnosis and management of constipation in the United States, 2006–2017 [^1159CvEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common diagnosis in adults and children. Emergency department (ED) visits for constipation increased from 1980 to 2010. Since then, efforts have aimed to reduce resource utilization for constipation in the ED setting. Our objective is to examine contemporary ED practice patterns in the context of updated care guidelines.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2006 to 2017. Encounters with a constipation diagnosis were included. We examined rates of ED visits, diagnostic testing, and medication use. We also compared general and pediatric ED practice patterns for children.

- **Results**: Approximately 1.3 million ED visits with a diagnosis of constipation occurred annually, with pediatric encounters comprising one-third of all visits. There was a 114% increase in ED visits for constipation over the study period. Urinalysis and imaging increased by 17% and 15%, respectively. Older patients were more likely to undergo diagnostic testing. No significant changes in laboratory testing, radiographs, or osmotic laxative prescriptions were observed among children. Compared to pediatric EDs, general EDs were more likely to perform CBC (29% vs. 15%) and urinalysis testing (42% vs. 31%). General EDs were less likely to prescribe osmotic laxatives for children compared to pediatric EDs (26% vs. 37%).

- **Conclusion**: ED visits for constipation have increased significantly since 2006. Rates of diagnostic tests and prescriptions have not changed despite published evidence and guidelines that the diagnostic approach should be streamlined.

### Epidemiology of childhood constipation: A national study of Swedish children from 2006 to 2023 [^113WyXRm]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

International and Swedish guidelines advocate for lifestyle advice and education as the first-line intervention for constipation. If this proves ineffective, pharmacological treatment is necessary. Macrogol was approved for the treatment of constipation in children in 2006, and since then, prescriptions for macrogol in children aged 0–14 years have increased fivefold in Sweden.

During this period, guidelines for treating constipation evolved. The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition/NASPGHAN now recommend integrating early pharmacological treatment with non-pharmacological approaches for young children. This integration aims to interrupt the cycle that leads to persistent constipation and to prevent complications such as fecal impaction. Abdominal pain is a common reason for prescribing macrogol, and its side effects are negligible.

The reasons for the overall increase in prescriptions, including age- and gender-specific differences, lie beyond the scope of this study.

### Evaluation of constipation [^115GdiPw]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Constipation is the reason for 2.5 million physician visits per year in the United States, with more than half of these visits to primary care physicians. Patients and physicians frequently define constipation differently. To determine the underlying cause of constipation, it is important to evaluate the patient's general health, psychosocial status, medical illnesses, dietary fiber intake, and use of constipating medications. The differential diagnosis of constipation and the approach to its evaluation differ in adults and children. Tests of physiologic function are usually reserved for constipation that does not respond to conventional therapy. Family physicians can effectively manage most patients who have constipation.

### Integrative approaches to childhood constipation and encopresis [^115WW1wQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Constipation and encopresis (fecal soiling) are common childhood disorders that may lead to significant functional impairment. The etiology and course of these conditions are increasingly conceptualized from a broad biopsychosocial perspective. Therefore, a holistic approach to assessment and treatment is indicated. Many children experience symptoms of chronic constipation and/or encopresis that are only partially responsive to conventional medical therapy. Complementary and alternative therapies can often assist in the treatment and are well accepted by patients and families.

### Unmet needs in pediatric functional constipation [^112z91Ls]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, the knowledge and awareness among pediatricians of PFC pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies are quite limited, creating barriers to disease management. While treatment guidelines are a valuable resource providing clarity on disease definition, diagnosis, and overall approaches to treatment, a recent survey found that 84.3% of practicing pediatricians (n = 967 completed responses) considered themselves to be unfamiliar or slightly familiar with the NASPGHAN treatment guidelines.

- **Common initial interventions**: For PFC without fecal incontinence, polled physicians opted for increased fluid intake (92.1%), dietary fiber (89.5%), prune/fruit juice (77.7%), behavioral interventions (71.2%), regular follow-up (53.4%), and reducing constipating foods (50.1%). Medication was reserved as the secondary intervention in most cases (55.2%), highlighting its lack of use until after the previous interventions failed.

The above-mentioned study also reported that for constipation with fecal incontinence, bowel cleanout was considered crucial because disimpaction needs to occur before maintenance therapy can begin, yet 26.6% of respondents were unaware of this intervention. Regarding the choice of maintenance medication, 90.5% of respondents used osmotic laxatives, 27% used stimulant laxatives, and 28% used a combination of the two. Given that stimulant laxatives may be useful as rescue medication in refractory cases and in children with cecostomies, their use should be encouraged or at least evaluated more often.

### Knowledge and practice styles of pediatricians in Saudi Arabia regarding childhood constipation [^113UJVGS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate knowledge and practice styles among medical providers working in five regions of Saudi Arabia regarding their approach to childhood constipation.

- **Methods**: A survey of 850 pediatric providers (PPs) was conducted in five regions of Saudi Arabia. The participants included pediatric specialists (PSs), pediatric consultants (PCs), general practitioners (GPs), family physicians (FPs), and pediatric gastroenterologists (PGs). They were asked anonymously about the definition, causes, diagnosis, and management of constipation. Information about family concerns regarding constipation and the source of constipation-related information was also collected.

- **Results**: A response rate of 73% yielded 622 questionnaires. Among respondents, 61.2% were aware of the Rome definition of functional constipation. More pediatricians (PSs and PCs) than other physicians (GPs and FPs) reported the definition of constipation correctly (P > 0.05). Stool withholding was reported as the most common cause of constipation by 27% of pediatricians (PSs and PCs), 24% of other physicians (GPs and FPs), and 50% of PGs (P = 0.097). Rectal examination was performed by 39% of all PPs and 78.6% of PGs (P = 0.009). Pediatricians prescribed lactulose significantly more often than physicians did (P = 0.001) and recommended disimpaction before maintenance treatment significantly more than other physicians (P = 0.001). Additionally, 23% of families believed that constipation was caused by a stricture, and 10% feared it was caused by a malignancy.

- **Conclusions**: Significant difference in knowledge and practice styles was observed among different groups of medical providers.

### What is the role of stimulant laxatives in the management of childhood constipation and soiling [^116kLz4F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe cases involves emptying the bowels of impacted feces using oral or rectal laxatives and then maintaining regular bowel movements through the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives.

- **Objectives**: The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling/encopresis.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane database of randomized controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching pediatric journals and through contact with known professionals in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: All identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the administration of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials were found that met the selection criteria.

- **Main results**: No trials adequately met the selection criteria.

- **Reviewer's conclusions**: There is a need to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions. Adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.

### Consensus review of best practice of transanal irrigation in children [^112uXB2J]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients with either functional or organic bowel dysfunction may suffer from constipation and fecal incontinence, representing a complex group in whom management is often difficult. Many noninvasive and invasive treatments have been proposed, with variable efficacy and adverse effects. Transanal irrigation (TAI) is now an accepted alternative, in both children and adults, for bowel dysfunction that has not responded to conservative and medical therapies. There is, however, still some uncertainty about the use of TAI in pediatric populations.

A group of specialists from different nations and pediatric disciplines, all with long-standing experience in bowel management in children, performed a literature search and engaged in round table discussions to determine the best-practice use of TAI in the pediatric patient population. Based on these findings, this article provides best-practice recommendations on various aspects of TAI:

- **Indications**: The article outlines specific cases where TAI might be beneficial.
- **Patient selection**: It emphasizes selecting the right candidates for TAI.
- **Important considerations before treatment**: Necessary preparations before initiating TAI.
- **Patient and family training**: The need for thorough training for both patients and their families.
- **Treatment regimens**: Details on how to structure TAI sessions.
- **Troubleshooting**: Advice on managing common issues that may arise during TAI.
- **Practical aspects of TAI**: Tips and insights into the technical application of TAI.

The conclusion highlights that careful patient selection, a tailored approach, directly supervised training, and sustained follow-up are key to optimizing outcomes with TAI in children with functional or organic bowel dysfunction.

### Current practice in the care of children with functional constipation: What is the hold up [^111vYYhU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

For children with intractable functional constipation (FC), there are no evidence-based guidelines for subsequent evaluation and treatment. Our objective was to assess the practice patterns of a large, international cohort of pediatric gastroenterologists.

- **Methods**: We administered a survey to physicians who attended the 2nd World Congress of Pediatric Neurogastroenterology and Motility held in Columbus, Ohio (USA) in September 2023. The survey included 29 questions on diagnostic testing, nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment, and surgical options for children with intractable FC.

- **Results**: Ninety physicians from 18 countries completed the survey. For children with intractable FC, anorectal manometry was the most commonly used diagnostic test. North American responders were more likely than Europeans to use stimulant laxatives (97% vs. 77%, p = 0.032), prosecretory medications (69% vs. 8%, p < 0.001), and antegrade continence enemas (ACE; 83% vs. 46%, p = 0.009) for management. Europeans were more likely than North Americans to require colonic transit testing before surgery (85% vs. 30%, p < 0.001). We found major differences in management practices between Americans and the rest of the world, including use of prosecretory drugs (73% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), anal botulinum toxin injections (81% vs. 58%, p = 0.018), ACE (81% vs. 58%, p = 0.018), diverting ileostomies (56% vs. 26%, p = 0.006), and colonic resections (42% vs. 16%, p = 0.012). No differences were found when respondents were compared by years of experience.

- **Conclusions**: Practice patterns in the evaluation and treatment of intractable FC show significant variation across different regions.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: Best care practice guidelines [^115Bzngp]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal tract

- **Constipation**: Constipation has been shown to be present in 35% of children with all types of EB and can cause abdominal pain and pain on defecation, as well as lead to perianal trauma. A case of colonic perforation and early death resulting from severe constipation in DEB has been described. Chronic perianal pain during defecation can produce stool withholding behavior, which exacerbates constipation. Chronic opioid use may contribute to poor bowel motility. The first line of management is prevention with dietary manipulation; however, patients with severe types of EB often require the regular use of a laxative (see Box 5). Polyethylene glycol is effective clinically in treating constipation in children and adults with EB, with empirical evidence of efficacy in adult and pediatric non-EB cohorts.

- **Colitis**: A subgroup of children with RDEB may develop colitis, presenting with abdominal pain and other symptoms. Dietary restriction and anti-inflammatory drugs, such as sulfasalazine, have been used, but with variable effects on controlling colitis.

- **Perianal pain**: Perianal blistering and ulceration are common and debilitating in children and adults with severe types of EB. Topically, sucralfate has been shown to be superior to petroleum jelly in facilitating anal fistulotomy healing and lessening wound pain. Sucralfate suspension has also been used to lessen the pain of oral and genital ulceration in patients with Behcet's disease. Anecdotally, topical sucralfate combined with Cavilon™ (an alcohol-free liquid barrier film that dries quickly to form a breathable barrier) has been reported to aid in pain relief.

Results

- **Study population**: Ninety-six subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized to a treatment, as indicated in Figure 2. One subject was excluded from the analysis as it did not meet the inclusion criteria regarding age. Two toddlers, from the test group, were lost to follow-up, as their parents decided not to continue with the study. The analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included 47 subjects in the test group and 48 subjects in the control group.

- **Participants flow-chart (Figure 2)**: This chart details the flow from potential enrollment to study completion.

- **Demographics of study groups**: The demographics of both study groups are presented in Table 2. Groups were well matched concerning gestational age, birthweight, baseline age, and anthropometrics. Additionally, similar numbers of subjects in each group attended childcare or had other significant caregivers, such as grandparents, siblings, and aunts.

- **Table 2 details**:
	- Demographics of subjects and their caregivers are presented by study group (mean ± SD).
	- **Note**:
		- a: One subject excluded from analysis based on age at baseline exceeding the inclusion criteria.
		- b: Childcare attendance was, on average, 5 days per week (range: 2–7 days).
		- **C**: Other reported caregivers included grandparents, siblings, and aunts.
		- **BMI**: Body mass index.

In addition to the study groups being well matched at baseline, the assessment of the simplified Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) showed no significant differences in feeding practices, such as estimated fiber and fluid intake. Moreover, no antibiotic use was reported at any point throughout the intervention, and none of the subjects were reported to use any laxatives during the post-maintenance period.

### Chronic constipation: new insights, better outcomes [^117Coowf]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Constipation is a symptom that affects around 11–20% of the adult population yearly. Most physicians consider infrequent defecation as a hallmark of constipation. However, most patients view excessive straining as the biggest component of constipation, and only a minority of patients with constipation have infrequent bowel movements. Constipation might be due to many different medical conditions or occur as a side-effect of drug therapy. When these medical conditions or drug therapies are not present, a diagnosis of functional constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is often made.

In all patients with constipation, rectal outlet dysfunction should be excluded by physical examination because this condition occurs in approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic constipation and can be improved with different therapeutic approaches than administration of laxatives. Because of the availability of over-the-counter laxatives, most patients consider themselves able to self-manage constipation, and patients have often tried many different treatments before seeking professional help. The physician must carefully assess these previous efforts of self-treatment, optimize them, and strategically use the increasing list of prescription medications for management.

### A collaborative effort to advance drug development in pediatric constipation and irritable bowel syndrome [^112Z8U8h]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and functional constipation, are common conditions in childhood, but no drugs are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for chronic use in pediatric patients with these disorders. Despite efforts to better standardize the diagnosis of these conditions in children, including recent modifications to the Rome criteria, conducting pediatric clinical trials to support drug approval remains a challenge.

In March 2018, the FDA, in collaboration with the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American College of Gastroenterology, convened a public workshop to discuss the challenges and opportunities in conducting pediatric clinical trials in functional gastrointestinal conditions. The workshop brought together gastroenterologists, psychologists, patients and patient advocates, regulators, and industry representatives to discuss trial design and conduct, including alternative designs, eligibility criteria, instruments for patient- and observer-reported outcomes, and optimal primary endpoints to support regulatory approval.

This report summarizes the workshop, identifies key challenges and knowledge gaps, and outlines areas where further research efforts are needed to overcome barriers to developing drugs to treat these conditions.

### Development of an early nurse led intervention to treat children referred to secondary paediatric care with constipation with or without soiling [^111PRd5x]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

A gap exists in research evidence related to clinical expertise and the organization of care. Specifically, questions arise such as: What is the required expertise? Who would best provide it? How might that fit into care pathways? Answering these questions continues in the tradition of Spitzer and Sackett's seminal trial of nurse practitioners in Canada in 1971–2. Notably, in North America, as Sackett states, "nurse practitioner–initiated care had to include using her associated family physician as an intermediate consultant in caring for her patients". Since Spitzer and Sackett's Burlington Trial, nurse practitioners have become important healthcare professionals in North America, Canada, and elsewhere. They work alongside doctors in both primary and secondary care to increase patient capacity while retaining quality and sometimes reducing cost.

NICE acknowledges gaps in knowledge. They have made a specific research recommendation: Do specialist nurse-led children's continence services or traditional secondary care services provide the most effective treatment for children with idiopathic constipation (with or without fecal incontinence) that does not respond fully to primary treatment regimens? This should consider clinical and cost effectiveness, and both short-term (16 weeks) and long-term (12 months) resolution. This recommendation focuses on the question: Who would best provide secondary care intervention? Our research program also aims to answer the other two questions: What is the required expertise? and How might that fit into care pathways?

### Osmotic and stimulant laxatives for the management of childhood constipation [^112HBPYn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Constipation within childhood is an extremely common problem. Despite the widespread use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives by health professionals to manage constipation in children, there has been a longstanding paucity of high-quality evidence to support this practice.

- **Objectives**: We set out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic and stimulant laxatives used to treat functional childhood constipation.

- **Search methods**: The search (inception to May 7, 2012) was standardized and not limited by language. It included electronic searching (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register), reference searching of all included studies, personal contacts, and drug companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared osmotic or stimulant laxatives with either placebo or another intervention, for patients aged 0 to 18 years old were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was the frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included fecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies, and adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Relevant papers were identified, and the authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Cochrane RevMan software was used for analyses. Patients with final missing outcomes were assumed to have relapsed. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval.

### Awareness and implementation of the 2014 ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline for childhood functional constipation [^113nc93W]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to assess whether physicians approach children with functional constipation according to the 2014 European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)/North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guideline.

- **Methods**: We invited pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists in the Netherlands and the United States to participate in this anonymous survey using a self-developed questionnaire containing 19 multiple choice questions concerning evaluation and treatment of children with constipation.

- **Results**: We included 328 physicians (67% from the United States, 34% from the Netherlands). The majority of US responders (53%) worked in primary care, whereas all Dutch responders worked in a hospital. In total, 31% of responders were not familiar with the guideline (38% US responders vs. 16% Dutch responders, P < 0.001). Perianal inspection was frequently ("often" or "always" on a 5-point Likert scale) conducted by 78% of responders. Digital rectal examination was frequently done by 42%. Inquiry about sexual abuse was made by 18%. Commonly reported reasons for omitting these items were perceived patient or parental discomfort. Most frequently implemented initial nonpharmacological interventions included a toilet training program (89%), optimizing fluid and fiber intake (86% and 81%), a defecation diary (62%), and a reward system (60%). Polyethylene glycol was the most prescribed medication for disimpaction (68%) and maintenance treatment (57% for infants, 97% for children).

The study highlights both adherence and gaps in the implementation of the guideline across different regions and emphasizes the importance of awareness among healthcare providers.

### Treatment of encopresis and chronic constipation in young children: Clinical results from interactive parent-child guidance [^111jZp9p]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the source of and treatment for encopresis in a series of 40 children under age 9 years, referral for psychological-based treatment followed upon limited success of standard gastroenterologic intervention. The treatment provided is defined as interactive parent-child family guidance. This includes a variety of specific psychologically based recommendations offered to parents and, when indicated, direct interventions with the symptomatic child. These are different from various forms of behavioral corrective reward-punishment interventions frequently recommended for young children with encopresis.

The pediatric and psychological literature offer few reports of successful treatment of young children with this syndrome. Also, there are few specific descriptions of psychologically based interventions. The results reported here are of the successful treatment of 38 of 40 cases referred specifically for psychologically based intervention following the prior limited success of standard gastroenterologic treatment. The interactive parent-child family guidance intervention described in this report, differentiated from typical behavior therapies, is a notably successful mode of psychologically based therapy for these children. It offers an important alternative to standard pediatric gastroenterological treatment for encopresis, as well as to reward-punishment oriented behavioral therapies.

### Recognizing and defining occasional constipation: Expert consensus recommendations [^113PDBZJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem, affecting 15% of the population, and is often self-diagnosed and self-managed. Over the past three decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding and management of chronic constipation, with the emerging recognition that occasional constipation (OC) is another subtype that falls outside standard classifications. The purpose of this review was to describe the process of developing and proposing a new definition for OC based on expert consensus, taking into consideration the multifactorial nature of the problem. These factors include alterations in bowel habit such as stool frequency and difficulty with stool passage, the perception of the sufferer, duration of symptoms, and potential responsiveness to treatment.

Leading gastroenterologists from five countries met virtually on multiple occasions through an online digital platform to discuss the problem of OC. They recommended a practical, user-friendly definition: "OC can be defined as intermittent or occasional symptomatic alteration(s) in bowel habit. This includes a bothersome reduction in the frequency of bowel movements and/or difficulty with passage of stools but without alarming features. Bowel symptoms may last for a few days or a few weeks, and episodes may require modification of lifestyle, dietary habits, and/or use of over-the-counter laxatives or bulking agents to restore a satisfactory bowel habit".

Prospective studies are required to validate this definition and determine OC prevalence in the community. This review highlights knowledge gaps that could provide impetus for future research and improved management strategies.

### Follow-up in childhood functional constipation: A randomized, controlled clinical trial [^117AACXW]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend close follow-up during the treatment of childhood functional constipation. However, there's limited evidence on how best to implement follow-up. This study aimed to evaluate whether follow-up by phone or self-management through web-based information improved treatment outcomes.

In this randomized controlled trial, conducted in secondary care, 235 children aged 2 to 16 years who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for childhood constipation were assigned to one of three follow-up regimens: the control group (no scheduled contact), the phone group (two scheduled phone contacts), and the web group (access to web-based information).

The primary outcome measured was the number of successfully treated children after 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of phone contacts, relapse, fecal incontinence, and laxative use.

After 3 and 6 months, significantly more children in the web group (79.7% and 75.9%, respectively) were successfully treated compared to the control and phone groups (59.7%/63.6% for the control group and 63.3%/64.6% for the phone group, with P = 0.007/P = 0.03, respectively). No difference was found after 12 months (control, 72.7%; phone, 68.4%; web group, 78.5%; P = 0.40). Extra phone consultations were significantly more frequent in the web group (44.3%) compared with the control group (28.6%) [P = 0.04]. Before 3 months, 45.5% of phone consultations were completed in the web group versus 28.8% and 25.8% in the control and phone groups, indicating statistical significance (P = 0.05/P = 0.02). There were no differences between interventions for relapses, fecal incontinence, and laxative use.

The study concluded that improved self-management behavior was driven by access to self-motivated web-based information.

### Laxative weaning protocol for patients with functional constipation: A pilot study [^112TMFqG]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Children with functional constipation require prolonged laxative administration for proper emptying. Whether these laxatives can be weaned after better functioning is achieved is unknown. We aim to describe a standardized protocol for stimulant laxative weaning and its early outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients were candidates for weaning if they had been on a stable laxative dose for six months, defined as one bowel movement per day with no soiling, impaction, or enemas. Laxative dose was decreased by 10–25% with re-evaluation every two weeks. If patients remained well without constipation, the dose was weaned further by 10–25%. If there was a worsening of symptoms, the lower dose was maintained for 3–6 months until re-evaluation.

- **Results**: There were a total of sixteen patients evaluated. The median age was 12.7 years [IQR: 11.7–15.3] with a laxative duration of 8.0 years [IQR: 5.4–10.7]. All patients were on senna; some were on fiber. The median starting senna dose was 71.3 mg [IQR: 54.3–75.0], and the median fiber dose was 5.5 g [IQR: 4.0–6.0]. As of the most recent follow-up, nine patients (56.3%) had weaned off laxatives in 3.7 months [IQR: 1.3–11.6]. For those still on laxatives, the median reduction in dose was 41.4 mg [30.0–75.0], and over half weaned their dose by more than 50%. Almost all (90.9%) of those on high doses were able to wean.

- **Conclusion**: A standardized laxative weaning process can be successful in patients with functional constipation, especially those on high doses. Further prospective studies will be necessary to confirm the success of this protocol.

- **Level of Evidence**: III.

### Novel and alternative therapies for childhood constipation [^115U2adq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common and distressing pediatric problem. Despite an increase in prevalence, the treatment of constipation in children is still largely based on clinical experience rather than evidence-based studies. The currently recommended treatment includes education, disimpaction, and maintenance therapy, which consists of dietary changes, behavioral modification, and the use of laxatives. Among osmotic agents, polyethylene glycol solutions appear to be the first-line drug to use in pediatrics.

Although these measures are effective in the majority of children, a sizable proportion requires long-term therapy. Chronic constipation may significantly interfere with a child's emotional growth and development. Advances in understanding the gastrointestinal enteric nervous system and epithelial function have led to the development of new classes of drugs. These include substances that bind to serotonin receptors or are chloride channel activators. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits and risks of these new drugs.

### Treatment of childhood constipation by primary care physicians: Efficacy and predictors of outcome [^112Gm1aD]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Childhood constipation accounts for 3% of visits to general pediatric clinics and as many as 30% of visits to pediatric gastroenterologists. The majority of children who experience constipation and whose caregivers seek medical care are seen by primary care physicians such as pediatricians or family physicians. Little is known about how primary care physicians treat childhood constipation or the success of their treatments. With this study, we prospectively examined which treatments primary care physicians prescribe to children who present for the first time with constipation and how effective those treatments are.

A total of 119 children who were between 2 and 7 years of age (mean: 44.1 ± 13.6 months) and presented to 26 different primary care physicians (15 pediatricians and 11 family physicians) for the treatment of constipation for the first time participated in this study. Parents completed daily diaries of their child's bowel habits for 2 weeks before starting treatment recommended by their primary care physician and again 2 months after treatment. The prescribed treatment was identified by reviewing office records of the treating physicians.

After 2 months of treatment, 44 (37%) of 119 children remained constipated. In the majority (87%) of cases, physicians prescribed some form of laxative or stool softener. The most commonly prescribed laxatives were magnesium hydroxide (77%), senna syrup (23%), mineral oil (8%), and lactulose (8%). In nearly all cases, a specific fixed dose of a laxative was recommended; in only 5% of cases were parents provided with flexible dosing instructions.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: Recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^112ZWnpk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Refractory constipation (RC) in pediatric patients should be recognized as a distinct condition with long-term impacts on patient and family quality of life. RC requires a more targeted diagnostic evaluation and complex management strategy that may involve management by pediatric neurogastroenterology and motility specialists and multidisciplinary teams, including surgeons. Currently, there is a lack of a clear definition, evaluation, and management strategies for RC. This is the first North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition position paper to address pediatric RC regarding its definition, evaluation, and management.

### Functional constipation in infants: A follow-up study [^115XV8z8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical course of severe functional constipation in early childhood. Eligible patients comprised 47 children (60% boys; median age, 3.5 months) who experienced constipation in their first year of life. Follow-up data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Success was defined as a period of at least 4 weeks with three or more painless bowel movements per week. Six months after the initial evaluation, 69% of the children had recovered. After initial success, a relapse occurred in 15% of the children within 3 years. A duration of symptoms less than 3 months before referral correlated significantly with a better outcome. We conclude that most infants with severe constipation evaluated at a tertiary center recover after 6 months. Early therapeutic intervention may beneficially contribute to the resolution of constipation.

### Long-term prognosis for childhood constipation: Clinical outcomes in adulthood [^117R4Y3V]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

This study examines the long-term prognoses for children with constipation into adulthood and identifies prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes. In a Dutch tertiary hospital, children aged 5–18 years who were diagnosed with functional constipation were eligible for inclusion. Following a 6-week treatment protocol, prospective follow-up evaluations were conducted at 6 and 12 months and annually thereafter. Good clinical outcomes were defined as having three or more bowel movements per week for four or more weeks, with two or fewer fecal incontinence episodes per month, regardless of laxative use.

A total of 401 children (260 boys; median age: 8 years [interquartile range: 6–9 years]) were included, with a median follow-up period of 11 years (interquartile range: 9–13 years). The dropout rate during follow-up was 15%. Good clinical outcomes were achieved by 80% of patients at 16 years of age, and thereafter, this proportion remained constant at 75%. Poor clinical outcomes in adulthood were associated with older age at onset (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–1.30]; p = 0.04), longer delay between onset and first visit to the outpatient clinic (OR: 1.24 [95% CI: 1.10–1.40]; p = 0.001), and lower defecation frequency at study entry (OR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.84–1.00]; p = 0.03).

One-fourth of children with functional constipation continued to experience symptoms in adulthood. Certain risk factors for poor clinical outcomes in adulthood were identified. Referral to a specialized clinic should be considered at an early stage for children with these risk factors.

### Osmotic and stimulant laxatives for the management of childhood constipation [^1132GMBr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Constipation within childhood is an extremely common problem. Despite the widespread use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives by health professionals to manage constipation in children, there has been a long-standing paucity of high-quality evidence to support this practice.

- **Objectives**: We set out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic and stimulant laxatives used to treat functional childhood constipation.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 10 March 2016. There were no language restrictions. We also searched the references of all included studies, personal contacts, and drug companies to identify studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared osmotic or stimulant laxatives to placebo or another intervention, with participants aged 0 to 18 years old, were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was the frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies, and adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Relevant papers were identified and two authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was the frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies, and adverse events. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: A randomized controlled trial [^1125etW8]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common health problems in infancy and early childhood. Even though they are mostly transient, they may be very distressing to a new parent as well as the child. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation), functional constipation (FC), and infantile colic are among the most common FGIDs, and they can occur separately or combined. Both reflux and colic self-resolve by the age of 12 months; however, FC often continues into toddlerhood, peaks when toilet training starts, and in extreme cases, continues even into adulthood.

The prevalence of paediatric FC is difficult to determine. It is a global issue, but it varies greatly across geographical regions. Most studies report it to range from 0.5 to 32%, with a global pooled prevalence of 9.5%. FC is characterized by infrequent bowel movements, hard and/or large stools, painful defecation, and faecal incontinence, and is often accompanied by abdominal pain. FC is not caused by anatomic abnormality, inflammation, or tissue damage, but the exact cause is still unclear. Its pathophysiology is thought to be multifactorial. Risk factors include stress, dietary habits, physical activity, obesity, family history of FC, poor toilet training, psychological difficulties, child maltreatment, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Stooling avoidance is seen as the key factor of paediatric FC.

FGIDs have been linked to both short- and long-term negative effects on the health and quality of life of young children as well as their caregivers. For example, both children with FC and their families can experience significant stress and challenges.

### Systematic review of family and pediatric constipation: An overlooked piece of the puzzle [^113cYnBN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to summarize pertinent literature examining family dynamics and/or adherence to treatment in pediatric functional constipation. A structured systematic literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science core collection libraries from the years 2000 to 2023 using specific search terms: constipation, treatment adherence, family dynamics, parenting style, and pediatrics. Seventy-one publications were identified and included for review. After screening for alignment to the review, 20 publications remained. These publications were placed into three categories based on their intent and findings:

- **Recommendations to further increase adherence**
- **Studies analyzing factors of adherence**
- **Studies stating a need for a better understanding of family factors**:

A future area of research is identifying the associations between family factors and adherence to constipation treatment regimens. Results from such studies would increase the number of positive treatment outcomes and decrease unnecessary healthcare costs.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: Evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^113f7fxp]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Constipation is a pediatric problem commonly encountered by many health care workers in primary, secondary, and tertiary care. To assist medical care providers in the evaluation and management of children with functional constipation, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition were charged with the task of developing a uniform document of evidence-based guidelines.

- **Methods**: Nine clinical questions addressing diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic topics were formulated. A systematic literature search was performed from inception to October 2011 using Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsychInfo databases. The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was applied to evaluate outcomes. For therapeutic questions, the quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Grading the quality of evidence for the other questions was performed according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. During three consensus meetings, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. The group members voted on each recommendation using the nominal voting technique. Expert opinion was used where no randomized controlled trials were available to support the recommendation.

- **Results**: This evidence-based guideline provides recommendations.

### Starreveld scoring method in diagnosing childhood constipation [^113hGTaF]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The four scores developed for evaluating constipation using an abdominal radiograph performed well on initial evaluation. However, on subsequent independent evaluations, both in the study and in others, these favorable initial results could not be replicated. Given both the suboptimal AUC and the large interobserver variability, the abdominal radiograph should not be part of the routine work-up of childhood constipation.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: Evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^117L9iEf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for constipation, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (diagnosis), ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2014 guidelines recommend performing a digital examination if only one of the Rome IV criteria is present and the diagnosis of functional constipation is uncertain.
