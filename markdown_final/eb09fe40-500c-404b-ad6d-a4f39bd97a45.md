## Question

How should a newborn be managed following placental abruption?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a newborn should be managed following placental abruption. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate neonatal stabilization and cord management. Then, I should stratify neonatal risk by severity of abruption and by gestational age/birth weight. Next, I will target monitoring for NEC, IVH, and anemia, followed by laboratory assessment for acidemia and coagulopathy. After that, I will address feeding strategy given the evidence gap, determine level of care and NICU admission triggers, and plan documentation and neurodevelopmental follow-up. Finally, I will consider placenta pathology and family counseling on recurrence and long-term risks.

> Let me first confirm immediate priorities at birth, because abruption is tightly linked to intrapartum hypoxia and depressed Apgar scores, necessitating readiness for advanced resuscitation per NRP principles and early NICU involvement if indicated, with literature describing profound bradycardia and severe asphyxia in abruptions requiring emergent delivery [^112s2vmp] [^1173stX6].

> Wait, cord management needs careful verification, especially under time pressure. My initial thought is to clamp the cord immediately to prevent fetal blood loss; however, I should confirm the basis for that recommendation because the cited RCOG guidance specifically addresses placenta previa at cesarean where transection of the placenta can cause exsanguination, and not abruption per se, though loss of placental circulation and the need for prompt resuscitation often make delayed cord clamping impractical or nonbeneficial in abruption scenarios, so immediate clamping is reasonable when there is fetal compromise or ineffective placental exchange, with the placenta previa guidance being the closest high-quality directive available here [^115JaaYa] [^1114iZaa].

> I need to stratify risk by the clinical severity of the abruption, because severe abruption — often operationalized by maternal shock, DIC, transfusion, renal failure, fetal distress or death, or serious neonatal complications — portends higher neonatal risk and should cue intensive monitoring for hypoxic-ischemic injury and multisystem involvement, whereas milder cases still warrant surveillance but may have a lower burden of complications [^113gwZxS] [^1114iZaa].

> Hold on, I should also separate risk by gestational age and birth weight, since pathophysiology and complications diverge. In very low birth weight infants, abruption is associated with increased IVH and severe IVH, which supports proactive neuroimaging and neuroprotective care, whereas in infants ≥ 1500 g, multiple national database studies show an association between abruption and NEC risk, a signal not seen in VLBW where competing risks predominate, underscoring two distinct monitoring priorities by weight category [^111VjYhs] [^112EGFtE] [^113VyQuF] [^116tJpP8] [^112gbMF9].

> Next, I will examine NEC surveillance in infants ≥ 1500 g after abruption, because the observed association suggests a cautious feeding approach even though no formal feeding guidelines exist for this subgroup; I should double-check modifiers such as African American race and male sex that further increase NEC risk and warrant heightened vigilance with individualized feeding plans and close abdominal and stool monitoring [^113VyQuF] [^116tJpP8] [^112gbMF9].

> For VLBW infants, I should confirm a plan for IVH monitoring. Given the elevated odds of IVH and severe IVH after abruption, routine cranial ultrasound screening per local VLBW protocols is appropriate; I need to ensure timing aligns with unit standards, while recognizing that the abruption-specific data strengthen the rationale for early imaging and careful hemodynamic management in this cohort [^112EGFtE] [^111VjYhs].

> I will now examine the risk of neonatal anemia because fetoplacental hemorrhage or sequestration can occur. Data suggest approximately 16% of abruption-exposed neonates have anemia in the first day, with a several-fold increase in severe anemia, especially when the abruption is not documented as small or marginal, so I should obtain hemoglobin/hematocrit in the first 24 hours and be prepared to transfuse per institutional thresholds if symptomatic or significantly low, while acknowledging exact transfusion triggers should follow local neonatal guidelines [^117BkiyR].

> Let me think about acid-base status and HIE screening. Obtaining cord or early postnatal blood gases is essential because severe abruption is associated with fetal acidemia, and a validated "severe abruption score" can flag the need for intensive neonatal therapy, prompting early HIE evaluation and consideration of therapeutic hypothermia when criteria are met, though I should confirm local cooling protocols and recognize that the score is applied postpartum and was derived retrospectively [^1173stX6].

> I should confirm coagulation testing because consumptive coagulopathy complicates abruption, and although maternal fibrinogen thresholds are well-described, they often parallel neonatal risk contexts; checking neonatal platelets and coagulation studies is reasonable when there is significant maternal DIC or clinical bleeding, with low fibrinogen linked to hemorrhagic severity on the maternal side and signaling broader coagulopathy in severe events [^113fLgQz] [^1114iZaa].

> Feeding strategy is an area where I need to be cautious, as there are no established post-abruption feeding guidelines. A prudent, individualized plan is to start enteral nutrition when hemodynamics are stable, favor human milk, begin with trophic feeds, and advance slowly while monitoring tolerance and NEC signs, particularly in infants ≥ 1500 g given the observed association, and to delay feeds and use parenteral nutrition if instability persists [^113VyQuF] [^116tJpP8].

> Now, level of care: I should verify NICU admission triggers. Infants from preterm or severe abruptions generally warrant NICU care, and term infants should be admitted if they required resuscitation, have 5-minute Apgar less than 7, demonstrate acidosis, anemia, or suspected sepsis, given the strong asphyxia signal and early morbidity in abruption-exposed neonates [^112ZFy3v] [^1173stX6] [^1114iZaa].

> Next, I should review documentation and plan for long-term follow-up. Careful recording of gestational age at abruption, estimated placental separation severity, maternal complications, and timing of delivery helps prognostication, and given elevated risks of neurodevelopmental sequelae and increased mortality beyond the neonatal period after abruption, high-risk infants need structured neurodevelopmental surveillance through at least two years with growth monitoring [^1173stX6] [^1114iZaa] [^116U2ftb].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of placental pathology, because distinguishing true abruption from clinical mimics can inform both prognosis and counseling. Sending the placenta for histopathology is appropriate, and when abruption-related lesions are confirmed, composite severe neonatal outcomes appear higher, strengthening the case for intensified neonatal surveillance in those dyads [^114nGcPs].

> I will now consider maternal-infant counseling and recurrence. Families should be informed that prior abruption confers a markedly increased recurrence risk on the order of several percent, far exceeding background risk, and future pregnancies should be managed as high-risk with early surveillance and optimization of ischemic placental disease risk factors where possible [^115wMG1R] [^112oMLMk].

> Let me not forget fetal growth concerns and the ischemic placental disease spectrum. Abruption clusters with preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction biologically and epidemiologically, and preterm abruption is associated with increased odds of growth restriction, so postnatal growth follow-up and, in future pregnancies, preventive strategies for placental disease merit consideration when evidence-based and safe [^112oMLMk] [^115V4iyJ] [^1114iZaa].

> In summary, management after placental abruption should be risk-stratified and complication-specific: prioritize prompt resuscitation and pragmatic cord management, surveil NEC in infants ≥ 1500 g, screen VLBW infants for IVH, check early hemoglobin and acid-base status, assess coagulation when indicated, tailor feeds cautiously due to the guideline gap, and ensure robust documentation, neurodevelopmental follow-up, and family counseling, while acknowledging that much of the literature is retrospective and that prospective multicenter data are needed to refine neonatal feeding and monitoring protocols after abruption [^113VyQuF] [^116tJpP8] [^111VjYhs] [^112EGFtE] [^117BkiyR] [^1173stX6] [^113fLgQz] [^116PV83v].

Placental abruption newborn management centers on **immediate resuscitation** and **early detection of complications**. At birth, initiate **neonatal resuscitation per NRP**, with prompt intubation and ventilation for severe asphyxia [^112ZFy3v], and early umbilical venous access for fluids and blood products. Monitor for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis [^111VjYhs] [^113VyQuF], and start **therapeutic hypothermia within 6 hours** if criteria are met [^notfound]. Manage anemia and coagulopathy with transfusions, maintain normothermia, normoglycemia, and normoxia, and provide supportive care including antibiotics and seizure control. Admit to **NICU** for close monitoring and involve multidisciplinary teams for ongoing care and follow-up [^1114iZaa].

---

## Immediate neonatal resuscitation

Placental abruption often causes **severe fetal hypoxia** and acidosis, requiring immediate resuscitation [^112kuoTr] [^111z744r]:

- **Initial assessment**: Rapidly assess airway, breathing, circulation, and temperature; assign Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes.

- **Airway and breathing**: Provide positive pressure ventilation if apnea, gasping, or heart rate < 100 bpm; intubate early for severe asphyxia [^1114iZaa].

- **Circulation**: Establish umbilical venous access quickly; give isotonic fluids (10 mL/kg) and packed RBCs (10–20 mL/kg) for shock or anemia.

- **Temperature control**: Use plastic wrap, warmers, and servo-controlled incubators to maintain normothermia (36.5–37.5°C).

- **Glucose management**: Monitor and maintain glucose ≥ 2.6 mmol/L (≥ 47 mg/dL) with IV dextrose as needed.

---

## Monitoring and management of complications

### Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)

- **Therapeutic hypothermia**: Start within 6 hours for moderate-to-severe HIE (criteria: gestational age ≥ 36 weeks, pH ≤ 7.0 or base deficit ≥ 16 mmol/L, or Apgar ≤ 5 at 10 minutes, or continued resuscitation at 10 minutes).

- **Neurological monitoring**: Use amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) or continuous EEG to detect seizures and guide therapy.

- **Seizure management**: Treat with phenobarbital or levetiracetam.

---

### Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)

Obtain **cranial ultrasound** within 24 hours in preterm or symptomatic infants, repeat as indicated, and provide **supportive care** focused on maintaining hemodynamic stability while avoiding rapid fluid shifts.

---

### Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)

NEC management includes **delaying enteral feeds** in unstable infants and initiating minimal enteral nutrition once stable. Start **broad-spectrum antibiotics** when NEC is suspected, and early surgical consultation is required if the disease progresses or perforation is suspected.

---

### Anemia and coagulopathy

Laboratory monitoring should include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen, and **transfusions** should provide packed RBCs for anemia and platelets, FFP, or cryoprecipitate for coagulopathy.

---

## Supportive care and ongoing management

- **Respiratory support**: Provide CPAP or mechanical ventilation as needed; give surfactant for RDS [^1114iZaa].

- **Cardiovascular support**: Use inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine) for persistent hypotension.

- **Infection prevention**: Use strict aseptic technique and antibiotics if infection is suspected.

- **Parental support**: Communicate clearly, offer counseling, and involve parents in care decisions.

---

## Long-term follow-up and outcomes

Long-term follow-up requires **regular neurodevelopmental assessments** for cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, and developmental delays. Multidisciplinary care should involve **neurology, developmental pediatrics, and rehabilitation services**, and parents should be educated on signs of developmental delay and connected with early-intervention resources [^1114iZaa].

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^111okjxp]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is multifactorial. Placental abruption is associated with serious neonatal complications attributed to the disruption of the maternal-fetal vascular interface. This study aimed to investigate the association between placental abruption and NEC.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the United States (US) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset for the years 2016–2018. Using the logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated to assess the risk of NEC in infants born to mothers with placental abruption after controlling for significant confounders. Analyses were repeated after stratifying the population into two birth weight (BW) categories: < 1500 g and ≥ 1500 g.

- **Results**: The study included 11,597,756 newborns. Placental abruption occurred in 0.16% of the population. NEC was diagnosed in 0.18% of infants, with a higher incidence (2.5%) in those born to mothers with placental abruption (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3, p < 0.001). Placental abruption was associated with NEC only in infants with BW ≥ 1500 g (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11–1.62, p 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: Placental abruption is associated with an increased risk of NEC in neonates with BW ≥ 1500 g. Research is needed to explore the mechanisms behind this association and to develop targeted interventions to mitigate NEC risks in this population.

- **Impact**: Placental abruption is associated with an increased risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates with a birth weight ≥ 1500 grams. This effect could be via direct in utero bowel injury or due.

### Prevalence and risk factors associated with birth asphyxia among neonates delivered in China: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZFy3v]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

In the present study, the main maternal factors affecting neonatal asphyxia were placental abruption, placenta previa, advanced maternal age, and primigravida. Placental abruption is closely related to neonatal asphyxia. An analysis of 285 newborns revealed that placental abruption accounts for 14% of children with asphyxia, and a multivariate analysis revealed that placental abruption is an independent risk factor for neonatal asphyxia. Similarly, placenta previa can also affect the occurrence of birth asphyxia in newborns. Placental factors, such as placenta previa, can cause maternal prepartum haemorrhage, reduce fetal blood perfusion, and lead to hypoxia and ischaemia.

Furthermore, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mothers and children increases with maternal age. Advanced maternal age is identified as one of the risk factors for neonatal asphyxia because age is an important factor that affects fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, there is a growing focus in research on primigravida childbirth. This is because there are high expectations for childbirth but little knowledge about childbirth, and increased negative emotions caused by a lack of childbirth experience can also affect the occurrence of neonatal asphyxia.

### Prediction of fetal acidemia in placental abruption [^116D6vHV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

A severe abruption score derived from discriminant function was calculated for the probability of fetal acidemia. As shown in Figure 1b, the optimal cut-off value for the severe abruption score was estimated to be 11–12. Even if fetal acidemia is present, there is a possibility for intact survival if prompt and aggressive therapy, such as brain hypothermia therapy, is initiated as soon as possible. Therefore, this score for confirmed cases might be useful for predicting the need for neonatal intensive therapy soon after delivery.

Moreover, this score not only represents the possibility of predicting fetal acidemia, but also highlights the significance of each item, thus facilitating clinical diagnosis in placental abruption. The amount of vaginal bleeding correlates poorly with the degree of placental separation and does not serve as a useful marker of impending fetal risk. Even with small amounts of vaginal bleeding in the setting of abdominal pain and uterine contractions, there should be close maternal and fetal evaluation for placental abruption.

As an adjunctive diagnostic method for placental abruption, the role of ultrasonography is not considerable. Glantz and colleagues, in a retrospective cohort study, found that the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of ultrasonography for placental abruption were 24%, 96%, 88%, and 53%, respectively, and stressed that a negative ultrasonogram did not rule out an abruption. Jaffe and colleagues also found that ultrasonography identified only 50% of abruptions confirmed by pathology.

### Placental abruption and risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants: The United States national inpatient database [^111VjYhs]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

To examine the association of placental abruption with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, the study utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) datasets. Preterm infants weighing less than 1500g at birth were included. The odds ratios (OR) for developing IVH and severe IVH in association with placental abruption were calculated. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were determined using logistic regression models.

The study encompassed 113,445 VLBW infants. IVH was observed in 18.7% of infants born to mothers with a history of placental abruption, compared to 14.7% in those without placental abruption, with an aOR of 1.25 (95% CI: 1.13–1.38), p < 0.001. Severe IVH occurred in 6.4% of infants born to mothers with a history of placental abruption, versus 4.0% in those without, with an aOR of 1.53 (95% CI: 1.30–1.78), p < 0.001.

In conclusion, placental abruption is associated with an increased prevalence of IVH and severe IVH in VLBW infants.

### Placenta praevia and placenta accreta: Diagnosis and management: Green-top guideline no. 27a [^115JaaYa]. BJOG (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for cesarean delivery, the RCOG 2019 guidelines specifically recommend clamping the umbilical cord immediately after fetal delivery. This is particularly important in cases of placenta previa to avoid excessive fetal blood loss if the placenta is transected during the uterine incision.

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: a retrospective study [^116vLFrU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

The results for the odds ratios for the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes are based on term or preterm delivery in women with placental abruption (PA). Using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, we assess the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adjustments were made for baseline characteristics, including maternal age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, pre-delivery weight, gravidity, delivery number, cesarean delivery number, preeclampsia, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and malpresentation. Key abbreviations include PA: placental abruption; CI: confidence interval; PPH: postpartum hemorrhage; ICU: Intensive Care Unit; NICU: neonatal intensive care unit; OR: odds ratio; aOR: adjusted odds ratio.

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: A retrospective study [^116PV83v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Several limitations of this study must be considered. This retrospective study included a cohort of patients with placental abruption (PA) from a single tertiary center, potentially introducing inevitable selection bias and limiting the generalizability of the findings, such as resource utilization. We acknowledge the wide confidence intervals in some of our findings, which suggest uncertainty in estimating the exact risk associated with PA. This is likely due to the relatively small number of cases and the heterogeneity of outcomes in this population. Multicenter, prospective studies with large sample sizes are still needed to validate our findings.

Additionally, long-term follow-up of preterm infants and those with PA is necessary to assess their growth, development, and long-term health outcomes. Although PA is a rare complication, its morbidity cannot be precisely estimated. Future research should focus on the mechanisms of identified risk factors and developing more effective screening and prevention strategies for PA, particularly in high-risk populations.

In summary, our study provides critical insights into the management of PA administration in both term and preterm pregnancies, underscoring the profound impact of PA timing on maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Preterm PA is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe maternal complications, including uterus-placenta apoplexy, fetal growth restriction, and adult ICU admission. These maternal complications, in turn, contribute to adverse neonatal outcomes, such as increased rates of stillbirth and NICU admission. Clinical strategies should focus on…

### Placental abruption and neonatal anemia [^117BkiyR]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

Placental abruption can cause maternal blood loss and maternal anemia. It is less certain whether abruption can cause fetal blood loss and neonatal anemia.

- **Study design**: Retrospective multi-hospital 24-month analysis of women with placental abruption and their neonates.

- **Results**: Of 55,111 births, 678 (1.2%) had confirmed abruption; 83% of these neonates (564) had one or more hemoglobins recorded in the first day. Four hundred seventy (83.3%) had a normal hemoglobin (≥ 5th% reference interval), while 94 (16.7%) had anemia, relative risk 3.26 (95% CI, 2.66–4.01) vs. > 360,000 neonates from previous reference interval reports. The relative risk of severe anemia (< 1st% interval) was 4.96 (3.44–7.16). When the obstetrician identified the abruption as "small" or "marginal", the risk of anemia was insignificant.

- **Conclusions**: Most abruptions do not cause neonatal anemia, but approximately 16% do. If an abruption is not documented as small, it is important to surveille the neonate for anemia.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: a case report and literature review [^113Pcucn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

This case highlights the importance of considering uterine torsion as a potential diagnosis when faced with symptoms such as abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, despite their non-specific nature. Based on the symptoms, signs, and fetal heart rate monitoring, we considered a diagnosis of placental abruption and fetal distress. In critical situations, an emergency cesarean section is performed without prior ultrasound evaluation. If the situation is less urgent, we may conduct an ultrasound evaluation and compare previous results, potentially confirming a diagnosis of uterine torsion before delivery.

- **Impact of uterine torsion**: By narrowing the venous lumen, twisting of any uterus-like organ results in decreased perfusion. When uterine torsion occurs, the torsional venous lumen narrows, causing a decrease in venous blood flow, followed by reduced blood supply to the uterus. This leads to increased pressure in the placental cotyledons, culminating in fetal distress and placental abruption.

- **Factors associated with placental abruption**: Studies have identified several factors including maternal asthma, previous cesarean section, cocaine use, endometriosis, chronic hypertension, older maternal age, maternal smoking, use of antiretroviral therapy, low preconception weight, preeclampsia, uterine leiomyoma, and cannabis use. Based on this report, uterine torsion, a rare condition, should also be considered.

- **Management of perinatal uterine torsion**: The management strategy depends on when torsion occurs during pregnancy. In all cases, laparotomy is necessary. When uterine torsion occurs before the fetus is viable, treatment involves laparotomy and uterine detorsion.

### Clinical outcomes in high-risk pregnancies due to advanced maternal age [^11572U8q]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Advanced maternal age (AMA) is linked to a higher prevalence of placenta previa and placental abruption, both of which cause bleeding in late pregnancy (after about 20 weeks). Placental abruption is a rare but serious complication in the second half of pregnancy and life-threatening for both the mother and the fetus. Death is inevitable if a complete or near-complete placental separation occurs unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1%–40% have been reported, but these rates depend on the age of the fetus and extent of separation. Around 1%–5% of maternal deaths each year are linked to placental abruption. Mothers at very advanced maternal age are also at a higher risk for placental abruption. Multiparity is associated with a considerable proportion of the excess risk for both placental abruption and placenta previa; however, no significant correlation was observed between maternal age and abruption when parity and hypertension were considered.

Age and parity appear to be independent risk factors for placenta previa. Despite a small absolute risk (0.25% vs. 0.03%), nulliparous women aged ≥ 40 years have a 10-fold increased risk of placenta previa compared with nulliparous women aged 20–29 years.

- **Amniotic fluid embolism and obstetric shock**: Although the etiology of amniotic fluid embolism remains unknown, the embolism may occur in healthy women during labor, including cesarean section; after abnormal vaginal delivery; during the second trimester of pregnancy; up to 48 hours postdelivery; or during abortion; after abdominal trauma; and during amnioinfusion.

### Analysis of risk factors of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^112vWGdY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Common maternal complications include placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and HELLP syndrome, while fetal complications mainly include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal distress, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, abnormal diastolic blood flow signals, premature delivery, and stillbirth.

- **Diagnostic criteria for placental abruption**: The placental abruption surface does not exceed one-third of the placental area. The signs are not obvious; the main symptoms are a large amount of vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain or mild abdominal pain, and a normal fetal heart rate.

- **Diagnostic criteria for postpartum hemorrhage**: The amount of blood loss reaches or exceeds 500 mL within 24 hours after the delivery of the fetus.

- **Diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction (FGR)**: Fetal head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference are measured by ultrasound, and fetal weight (EFW) is estimated by substituting the Hadlock formula. FGR is diagnosed if the EFW is less than the 10th percentile of the same gestational age.

- **Diagnostic criteria for fetal distress**: The fetus in the womb may experience acute or chronic hypoxia endangering its health and life, mainly manifested as abnormal fetal heart rate during delivery, amniotic fluid meconium contamination, and abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring (late deceleration, frequent mutation deceleration). Abnormal fetal movement, such as initial frequent fetal movements followed by weakening and reduction, leading to disappearance, is also noted. Intrauterine distress is diagnosed if any of the above criteria are met.

### Vaginal misoprostol versus intracervical Foley catheter for cervical ripening in postdate primigravid women: a randomized clinical trial [^116mKYkQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). High credibility.

In our study, the rate of placental abruption was significantly higher with vaginal misoprostol (15%) compared to FC (1.7%). Previous studies have reported various rates of placental abruption with misoprostol. Placental abruption occurred in none of the patients in the misoprostol group and only 1 patient in the FC + oxytocin group of the study by Filho et al. Balci et al. reported placental abruption in 1 patient in the misoprostol + oxytocin group of their study. Fontenot et al. showed a significantly higher rate of placental abruption with misoprostol (13.7%) compared to dinoprostone (1.9%). The higher rate of placental abruption in our study can be due to the difference in definition. The cases of placental abruption in the study were diagnosed postpartum, when we observed placental hematoma after delivery by clinical examination of the placenta. We know that none of the cases leading to C-section were because of placental abruption; however, we cannot determine whether any of these cases of abruption had caused NICU admission or fetal distress. This questions the clinical significance of the high rate of placental abruption in the misoprostol group of our study.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^113W93Km]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Efforts to elucidate risk factors for placental abruption are imperative due to the severity of complications it produces for both mother and fetus, and its contribution to preterm birth. Ethnicity-based differences in the risk of placental abruption and preterm birth have been reported. We tested the hypotheses that race, after adjusting for other factors, is associated with the risk of placental abruption at specific gestational ages, and that there is a greater contribution of placental abruption to the increased risk of preterm birth in Black mothers compared to White mothers.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Missouri Department of Health's maternally-linked database of all births in Missouri (1989–1997) to assess racial effects on placental abruption and the contribution of placental abruption to preterm birth at different gestational age categories (n = 664,303).

- **Results**: Among 108,806 births to Black mothers and 555,497 births to White mothers, 1.02% (95% CI 0.96–1.08) of Black births were complicated by placental abruption, compared to 0.71% (95% CI 0.69–0.73) of White births (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22–1.43). The magnitude of risk of placental abruption for Black mothers, compared to White mothers, increased with younger gestational age categories. The risk of placental abruption resulting in term and extreme preterm births (< 28 weeks) was higher for Black mothers (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29 and aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.58–2.48, respectively). Compared to White women delivering in the same gestational age category, there were a significant increase in risk for Black mothers.

### Prediction of fetal acidemia in placental abruption [^1173stX6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

We have evaluated clinical symptoms, ultrasonographic findings, and FHR (Fetal Heart Rate) patterns in placental abruption from the analysis of a relatively large number of cases. Our study demonstrates that the 'severe abruption score' is useful for predicting fetal acidemia in placental abruption. However, this score is derived from the retrospective diagnosis of abruption and cannot be employed before delivery.

Because the etiology of placental abruption is heterogeneous and speculative, and clinical abruption represents the culmination of a prolonged disease process within the placenta, the diagnosis in this study was based on clinical manifestations, with placental detachment being confirmed after delivery. Consequently, the clinical background of patients in the present study may be more severe than in some other studies. As a result, the percentage of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality was high.

The association between placental abruption and the occurrence of infant neurodevelopmental disorders has been confirmed. Abruption increases hypoxic insults through two mechanisms. First, the separation of the placenta from the maternal blood supply decreases the placental surface area and thus impedes oxygen exchange, depending on the extent of separation. Second, there is often a marked increase in the frequency and occasionally the duration of contractions, which prolongs the interval during which oxygen delivery to the intervillous space is interrupted. Since placental abruption is a mechanism of fetal hypoxia/acidosis, it is one of the most important factors contributing to fetal health concerns.

### Figo recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^1149wjCn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for postpartum hemorrhage, specifically concerning the delivery of the placenta, the FIGO 2022 guidelines recommend administering oxytocin intravenously or intramuscularly. Furthermore, they suggest performing controlled cord traction for the removal of the placenta to prevent PPH in Cesarean delivery.

### The ability of computed tomography to diagnose placental abruption in the trauma patient [^1153kkc9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Fetal demise following trauma remains a devastating complication, largely owing to placental injury and abruption. Our objective was to determine if abdominopelvic computed tomographic (CT) imaging can assess for placental abruption (PA) when obtained to exclude associated maternal injuries.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review of pregnant trauma patients of 20-week gestation or longer who presented to a trauma center during a 7-year period and underwent CT imaging as part of their initial evaluation. Radiographic images were reviewed by a radiologist for evidence of PA and classified based on the percentage of visualized placental enhancement. Blinded to CT results, charts were reviewed by an obstetrician for clinical evidence of PA and classified as strongly positive, possibly positive, or no evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 176 patients met inclusion criteria. CT imaging revealed evidence of PA in 61 patients (35%). As the percentage of placental enhancement decreased, patients were more likely to have strong clinical manifestations of PA, reaching statistical significance when enhancement was less than 50%. CT imaging evidence of PA was apparent in all patients who required delivery for nonassuring fetal heart tones.

- **Conclusion**: CT imaging evaluation of the placenta can accurately identify PA and therefore can help stratify patients at risk for fetal complications. The likelihood of requiring delivery increased as placental enhancement declined to less than 25%.

Level of evidence: Diagnostic study, level III.

### Prediction and prevention of ischemic placental disease [^112oMLMk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and placental abruption are obstetrical conditions that constitute the syndrome of ischemic placental disease (IPD), the leading cause of indicated preterm birth and an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. While the phenotypic manifestations vary significantly among preeclampsia, IUGR, and abruption, these conditions may share a common underlying etiology as evidenced by the following factors: shared clinical risk factors, increased recurrence risk across pregnancies as well as increased co-occurrence of IPD conditions within a pregnancy, and findings that suggest the underlying pathophysiologic processes may be similar. IPD is of major clinical importance and accounts for a large proportion of indicated preterm delivery, ranging from the periviable to late preterm period. Successful prevention of IPD and resultant preterm delivery could substantially improve neonatal and maternal outcomes.

### Meta-analysis on the effect of aspirin use for prevention of preeclampsia on placental abruption and antepartum hemorrhage [^111EFHot]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Impaired placentation in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent development of preeclampsia, birth of small-for-gestational-age neonates, and placental abruption. Previous studies reported that prophylactic use of aspirin reduces the risk of preeclampsia and small-for-gestational-age neonates, with no significant effect on placental abruption. However, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining the effect of aspirin, in relation to gestational age at the onset of therapy and dosage, reported that significant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia and small-for-gestational-age neonates is achieved only if the onset of treatment is at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and the daily dosage of the drug is ≥ 100 mg.

We aimed to estimate the effect of aspirin on the risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage in relation to the gestational age at onset of therapy and the dosage of the drug.

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the prophylactic effect of aspirin during pregnancy, we used PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 1985 to September 2017. Relative risks of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effect models. The analyses were stratified according to the daily dose of aspirin (16 weeks of gestation).

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^111BA427]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

For the subset of women delivering at term or post-term gestational ages, there was a significantly greater proportion of placental abruption in Black mothers (0.61%) compared to White mothers (0.50%) (p < 0.001). In contrast, the proportion of Black mothers with placental abruption delivering at late preterm, very preterm, or extreme preterm birth gestation ages was lower than White mothers. The frequency of placental abruption in these preterm birth categories increased as gestational age at birth decreased for both Black mothers and White mothers.

- **Relative contribution of placental abruption to preterm birth**: A stratified analysis demonstrated the difference in placental abruption contribution to preterm birth between Black and White women.

	* The p-value for the chi-square test indicated statistical significance.
	* The binary variable was restricted to subpopulations of term births, late PTB, very PTB, and extreme PTB. OR was calculated using binary logistic regression.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112j9X3f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is a serious complication of pregnancy, with an incidence rate among pregnant women ranging from 0.6% to 1.2%. Despite its relatively low occurrence, it can lead to severe obstetric complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, peripartum hysterectomy, amniotic fluid embolism, severe respiratory distress, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and even maternal mortality. Furthermore, placental abruption negatively impacts the long-term prognosis for both mothers and newborns, increasing morbidity and mortality rates. The prognosis for patients with placental abruption is closely related to early accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. However, due to its nonspecific symptoms, insidious onset, and rapid progression, the rates of missed and misdiagnosis are high, making diagnosis particularly challenging. Therefore, timely identification of the risk factors for placental abruption is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on the potential risk factors for placental abruption, including advanced maternal age, chronic hypertension, multiparity, preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, and previous medical history. However, due to differences in study design, sample sizes, and assessment methods, the conclusions in the existing literature show considerable inconsistency. Some early studies suggested that preeclampsia is not a risk factor for placental abruption, while more recent studies indicate that preeclampsia is actually an independent risk factor.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: a case report and literature review [^112s2vmp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Uterine torsion is a rare obstetric event that can occur during pregnancy and is difficult to diagnose, potentially leading to serious adverse pregnancy outcomes. The case involves a 33-year-old woman at 30+5 weeks' gestation with a singleton pregnancy. The course of the pregnancy, including fetal growth and prenatal examinations, was regular. Aside from a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy treated with progesterone, there were no prenatal abnormalities; the patient denied any trauma or sexual history.

The patient was admitted to the emergency department with persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen and slight vaginal bleeding during sleep. Abdominal pain began two hours prior to admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Examination revealed positive abdominal tenderness, high uterine tone, and no significant intermittent periods of uterine contractions. Measurement of the fetal heart rate through a nonstress test revealed a rate of 60 beats per minute, leading to a high suspicion of placental abruption. Consequently, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. The newborn boy, with Apgar scores of 0–3–4 after birth and weighing 1880g, was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and died two days later due to ineffective rescue attempts.

After the uterine incision was sutured, an examination revealed that the uterine incision was located on the posterior wall of the uterus, and the uterus was twisted 180° to the right.

### Prediction of fetal acidemia in placental abruption [^113kvnnx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in the present study. First, this study was conducted in a retrospective fashion; therefore, further study is warranted to prove the usefulness of this score prospectively. Second, since a severe abruption score is based only on cases where a diagnosis of abruption was confirmed according to placental appearance just after delivery and is designed to be used immediately after delivery, this score should be used with caution. Finally, it is important to understand that this score is influenced by the sample size. The prognosis of the babies born following placental abruption will be reported separately.

### Severe placental abruption: Clinical definition and associations with maternal complications [^113gwZxS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is traditionally defined as the premature separation of the implanted placenta before the delivery of the fetus. The existing clinical criteria of severity rely exclusively on fetal (fetal distress or fetal death) and maternal complications without considering neonatal or preterm delivery-related complications. However, two-thirds of abruption cases are accompanied by fetal or neonatal complications, including preterm delivery. A clinically meaningful classification for abruption, therefore, should include not only maternal complications but also adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to define severe placental abruption and to compare serious maternal morbidity profiles of such cases with all other cases of abruption (i.e. mild abruption) and non-abruption cases.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using the Premier database of hospitalizations that resulted in singleton births in the United States between 2006 and 2012 (n = 27,796,465). Severe abruption was defined as abruption accompanied by at least one of the following events: maternal (disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypovolemic shock, blood transfusion, hysterectomy, renal failure, or in-hospital death); fetal (non-reassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal death); or neonatal (neonatal death, preterm delivery, or small for gestational age) complications. Abruption cases that did not qualify as being severe were classified as mild.

### Placental abruption [^112kuoTr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Placental abruption complicates about 1% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of vaginal bleeding in the latter half of pregnancy. It is also an important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The maternal effect of abruption depends primarily on its severity, whereas its effect on the fetus is determined both by its severity and the gestational age at which it occurs.

- **Risk factors**: Include prior abruption, smoking, trauma, cocaine use, multifetal gestation, hypertension, preeclampsia, thrombophilias, advanced maternal age, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, intrauterine infections, and hydramnios. Abruption involving more than 50% of the placenta is frequently associated with fetal death.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of abruption is a clinical one, and ultrasonography and the Kleihauer-Betke test are of limited value.

- **Management**: The management of abruption should be individualized on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the abruption and the gestational age at which it occurs. In cases where fetal demise has occurred, vaginal delivery is preferable. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy should be managed aggressively. When abruption occurs at or near term and maternal and fetal status are reassuring, conservative management with the goal of vaginal delivery may be reasonable. However, in the presence of fetal or maternal compromise, prompt delivery by cesarean is often indicated. Similarly, abruption at extremely preterm gestations may be managed conservatively in selected stable cases, with close monitoring and rapid delivery should deterioration occur.

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^116tJpP8]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this study highlighted the potential association between placental abruption and NEC in neonates with birth weight (BW) ≥ 1500 grams. NEC incidence was increased in the African American population and male infants. Future research is needed to identify the best strategies to enterally feed infants with BW ≥ 1500 grams after encountering placental abruption in order to mitigate the associated risk of NEC. This is particularly important as there are no guidelines for feeding infants with BW ≥ 1500 grams with or without placental abruption.

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: A retrospective study [^115V4iyJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Placental abruption (PA) is a severe obstetric complication defined as the partial or complete detachment of a normally situated placenta from the uterine wall before birth, after 20 weeks of gestation. It is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite its clinical importance, the pathogenesis of PA remains unclear, and there is limited research specifically comparing outcomes in term and preterm pregnancies with PA. This study aimed to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by PA based on the timing of PA onset, with a focus on differences between term and preterm deliveries.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included a total of 757 singleton pregnant women with confirmed PA from a tertiary obstetrics hospital care center between June 2020 to March 2024. Participants were classified into the preterm group (n = 300) and the full-term group (n = 457) based on their gestational age at PA onset. Baseline characteristics, maternal and newborn outcomes were collected from electronic health records in the hospital information system and were further analyzed between the two groups. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes based on term or preterm delivery in women with PA were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Women with preterm delivery had about three times greater risk for uterus-placenta apoplexy (aOR: 2.93, 95% CI 1.33–6.47, P = 0.01), and three times greater risk for fetal growth restriction (aOR: 3.47, 95% CI 1.45–8.30, P = 0.01).

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: A case report and literature review [^113iaFTp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

Physiological uterine torsion occurs when the sigmoid ring is located on the left side of the peritoneal cavity during pregnancy and does not exceed 45°. Uterine torsion is defined as a rotation of more than 45° about the long axis of the uterus, usually to the right, with the pivot point mostly at the level of the isthmus.

First reported in 1861, uterine torsion during pregnancy is a rare, unexpected obstetric emergency and may be a "never seen in a lifetime" diagnosis for most obstetricians. It is almost always diagnosed during cesarean section and can occur at any stage of pregnancy. Although uterine torsion is extremely rare, it can cause serious maternal and infant complications and occur again in subsequent pregnancies.

This report describes a case involving severe placental abruption and neonatal asphyxia caused by uterine torsion, with the death of the newborn two days later due to ineffective rescue.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uDYAV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Literature screening and data extraction were conducted strictly according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each eligible study, the following information was extracted: authors, study period, country, study type, sample size, age, data source, and adjusted confounding factors. Two researchers independently performed the literature screening, initially reviewing titles and abstracts for preliminary selection, followed by a thorough reading of the full texts to exclude studies that did not meet the criteria. Ultimately, the two researchers verified the selected studies against each other. In cases of disagreement, discussions were held to reach a consensus; if consensus could not be achieved, a third-party researcher was consulted for final evaluation regarding the inclusion of the study.

- **Quality assessment of studies**: The quality of the included observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which evaluates studies based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and outcome, with a scoring range of 0–9 points. Specific assessment criteria included selection (representativeness of the study population, adequacy of sample size, confirmation of exposure factors, etc), comparability (selection of control groups, control of confounding factors, etc), and outcome (methods of outcome assessment, completeness of follow-up, etc). Based on the scores, studies were categorized as high quality (7–9 points), moderate quality (4–6 points), or low quality (0–3 points).

### Ischemic placental disease and risks of perinatal mortality and morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcomes [^114Z6eSq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental abruption are serious obstetrical complications that constitute the syndrome of ischemic placental disease. These complications account for a disproportionate degree of perinatal morbidity and mortality. We review the risks of stillbirth, neonatal, and infant mortality in relation to ischemic placental disease, focusing on population-based studies. The review also covers risks of neonatal morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with ischemic placental disease.

A synthesis of findings from relevant studies highlights two important observations. First, despite the low prevalence of each of the three obstetrical complications, all are linked with increased risks of adverse perinatal and infant outcomes, as well as neurodevelopmental deficits. Second, the burden of increased perinatal risks seems strongest during the preterm period. Efforts to reduce the risks of ischemic placental disease remain critically important, and developing effective clinical interventions is a target worthy of consideration.

### Incidence and recurrence rate of placental abruption: A longitudinal linked national cohort study in the Netherlands [^115wMG1R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Women who have experienced a placental abruption have a risk of recurrence, but exact information to quantify this risk is currently not available. We studied the incidence and recurrence rate of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy and the influence of hypertensive disorders.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective national cohort study of all singleton pregnancies that ended from 1999–2007 in the Netherlands. A longitudinal linked national cohort of these women with information on a subsequent singleton delivery was used. We calculated and compared incidence and recurrence rates of placental abruption for women in total, stratified by gestational age of first placental abruption and by the presence of a hypertensive disorder in their first pregnancy.

- **Results**: We studied 1,570,635 women, of which 3496 (0.22%) experienced a placental abruption. Information was available on a subsequent singleton delivery for 264,424 deliveries. Of these, 521 women (0.20%) had a placental abruption in the first pregnancy vs. 214 women (0.08%) in the second pregnancy. The risk of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy was significantly higher in women with a previous placental abruption compared with women without (5.8% vs. 0.06%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 93; 95% confidence interval, 62–139). Women with a placental abruption that occurred at term in their first pregnancy were more at risk for recurrence (aOR, 188; 95% CI, 116–306) than women with a preterm (aOR, 52; 95% CI, 25–111) or early preterm (< 32 weeks of gestation) placental abruption in their first pregnancy.

### Placental abruption: Temporal trends, risk factors, and associated adverse maternal outcomes [^111z744r]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate trends in placental abruption during delivery hospitalizations and associated risk factors and adverse outcomes. Delivery hospitalizations with and without placental abruption were identified in the 2000–2020 National Inpatient Sample for this serial cross-sectional study. Temporal trends in abruption were analyzed with joinpoint regression to determine the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in abruption. The association between hospital, demographic, and clinical factors and abruption was analyzed with adjusted logistic regression models, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as measures of association. Further logistic regression models assessed the odds of adverse outcomes, including transfusion and severe maternal morbidity associated with abruption, accounting for demographic, hospital, and patient factors. Associations between changes in abruption and trends in the risk for adverse outcomes were then analyzed.

Results indicated that of 80.2 million deliveries from 2000 to 2022, 1.1 million had an abruption diagnosis. Placental abruption risk increased from 1.2% of deliveries in 2000 to 1.6% in 2020 (AAPC 1.6%, 95% CI 1.3%, 2.0%). Abruption was associated with multiple gestations, hypertensive diagnoses, diabetes, asthma, and Medicaid insurance. In adjusted analyses, abruption was associated with a range of adverse outcomes including transfusion (OR 6.86, 95% CI 6.70, 7.03), non-transfusion severe maternal morbidity (OR 4.05, 95% CI 3.93, 4.17), postpartum hemorrhage (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.72, 1.80), and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for the termination of pregnancy, particularly in evaluating placenta accreta, the SFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound as the imaging modality for this evaluation. It is important to recognize that the absence of ultrasound findings does not rule out a diagnosis of the placenta accreta spectrum. Additionally, clinical risk factors are equally significant predictors of the placenta accreta spectrum.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: A case report and literature review [^1143Sexo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Uterine torsion is a rare obstetric event that can occur during pregnancy and is difficult to diagnose. Its occurrence may lead to serious adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Case introduction**: The patient was a 33-year-old woman at 30 + 5 weeks' gestation with a singleton pregnancy. The pregnancy course, including fetal growth and prenatal examinations, was regular. Except for a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and treatment with progesterone, there were no prenatal abnormalities, and the patient denied any trauma or sexual history.

The patient was admitted to the emergency department with persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen and slight vaginal bleeding during the night. Abdominal pain started two hours prior to admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Examination revealed positive abdominal tenderness, high uterine tone, and no significant intermittent periods of uterine contractions. Measurement of the fetal heart rate by means of the nonstress test revealed a rate of 60 beats per minute, indicating that placental abruption was highly suspected.

Subsequently, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. The newborn boy, with Apgar scores of 0–3–4 after birth and weighing 1880 g, was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) but sadly passed away two days later due to ineffective rescue. After the uterine incision was sutured, examination revealed that the uterine incision was located on the posterior wall of the uterus, and the uterus was twisted 180° to the right.

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^115Vdzcc]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

This study is the first to describe the association between placental abruption and NEC in neonates with a birth weight (BW) ≥ 1500 g. African American race, male sex, maternal diabetes, hypertension, and chorioamnionitis were all associated with an increased risk of NEC. Placental abruption was not associated with NEC in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

Placental abruption was significantly associated with NEC in infants with BW ≥ 1500 g. This association is plausibly attributed to vascular remodeling within the fetal intestinal circulation following the event of placental abruption. Placental abruption may cause NEC either via direct in utero intestinal injury or indirectly through generalized postnatal compromise. Placental vascular function is compromised in the event of placental abruption; premature detachment of the placenta from its normal uterine implantation site results in diminution of the surface area for oxygen transfer and nutrient provision to the fetus and chronic hypoxia. Therefore, abruption disruption of the fetal intrauterine environment impacts fetal growth and development. Previous studies have shown a strong association between placental abruption and fetal growth restriction, with an almost 0.5 kg decrease in BW in infants experiencing placental abruption during pregnancy. Other studies have described a heightened incidence of preterm delivery after placental abruption and placental dysfunction. In addition, infants born following a placental abruption are at an even higher risk for postnatal hypoxic-ischemic insult with hemodynamic instability, indirectly leading to NEC.

### Immediate versus deferred delivery of the preterm baby with suspected fetal compromise for improving outcomes [^1171dWEN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Immediate delivery of the preterm fetus with suspected compromise may decrease the risk of damage due to intrauterine hypoxia, although it may also increase the risks associated with prematurity.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of immediate versus deferred delivery of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise on neonatal, maternal, and long-term outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as of 27 February 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials comparing a policy of immediate delivery with deferred delivery or expectant management in preterm fetuses with suspected in utero compromise were selected. Quasi-randomised trials and trials employing a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion; however, none were identified.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion in the review. They assessed trial quality and extracted data, which were then checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: We included one trial of 548 women (588 babies) in the review. There was no difference in the primary outcomes of extended perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 2.04) or the composite outcome of death or disability at or after two years (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75) between immediate delivery and deferred delivery. More babies in the immediate delivery group required ventilation for more than 24 hours (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97). There were no differences between the immediate delivery and deferred delivery groups in any other individual neonatal outcomes.

### Identifying risk factors for placental abruption in subsequent pregnancy without a history of placental abruption [^114TfCxZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

To identify first pregnancy risk factors for placental abruption in subsequent pregnancies, a population-based nested case-control study was conducted. Cases were defined as women who experienced placental abruption in their second pregnancy, whereas controls were those without abruption. A total of 43,328 women were included in the study; 0.4% (n = 186) of second pregnancies had placental abruption. Multivariable logistic models were employed to investigate the association between first pregnancy complications and placental abruption in subsequent pregnancies.

Having conditions such as small for gestational age, preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, or cesarean delivery during the first pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk for placental abruption. The risk escalated with each additional complication — aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.46–2.74 for one complication; aOR 3.61, 95% CI 2.23–5.86 for two complications; and aOR 3.86, 95% CI 1.56–9.56 for three or more complications.

First pregnancy may serve as a window of opportunity to identify women at risk for future placental abruption.

### Placental abruption in the United States, 1979 through 2001: Temporal trends and potential determinants [^116j6YCK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal trends in abruption risk and to assess how much underlying changes in the clinical determinants may have affected these trends.

We used the National Hospital Discharge Summary data (1979–2001), an annual survey of sampled non-federal, short-stay, general, and specialty hospitals in the United States. Trends in abruption were assessed for the periods 1979 through 1981 and 1999 through 2001. Clinical determinants of abruption that were evaluated included hypertensive diseases, anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, obstetric shock/trauma, uterine tumors, short umbilical cord, and velamentous cord insertion. Temporal trends in abruption were examined before and after adjustment for determinants through multivariable logistic regression.

The rate of abruption increased by 92% (95% CI, 88, 96) among black women between 1979–1981 (0.76%; n = 13,584 women) and 1999–2001 (1.43%; n = 18,960 women). Among white women, the rate increased by 15% (95% CI, 14, 16) over the same period, from 0.82% (n = 66,186 women) in 1979–1981 to 0.94% (n = 59,284 women) in 1999–2001. The determinants that were associated with trends in abruption included anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm labor, short umbilical cord, and velamentous cord insertion, although their effects varied substantially by maternal race.

The temporal increase in rates of abruption may reflect a true increase in risk or may be the result.

### The effect of placental abruption on the short-term outcome of premature infants [^113G1RPJ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of abruption on the outcome of preterm infants. Live-born infants of 23 to 32 weeks gestation born at Beaumont Hospital between 1995 and 1999 who suffered abruption constitute the study group. Controls were matched to cases by sex, gestational age, and birth weight. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for confirmation of abruption, determination of abruption grade, and subsequent neonatal outcome.

- **Univariate analysis**: Of the grade 2 abruption group revealed statistically significant differences in time from diagnosis to delivery (p = 0.04), Apgar scores at 5 minutes (p = 0.04), and acidotic cord blood (p = 0.04) between cases and controls. However, no differences in short-term outcome were appreciated.

In addition, no differences in mortality or morbidity were noted between grade 1 abruption case and control infants. We conclude that abruption is not an independent risk factor for poor outcome among infants born between 23 and 32 weeks gestation, but instead induces the preterm delivery that is the main determinant of outcome.

### A population-based study of race-specific risk for placental abruption [^1132EZ1u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

We find that Black women are at increased risk for placental abruption, especially at early gestational ages. However, placental abruption constitutes a smaller proportion of the causes of preterm birth (PTB) for Black women. Furthermore, the difference in the relative contribution of placental abruption between term and preterm gestations suggests heterogeneity in clinical pathways between these two significantly different birth outcomes.

### Placental abruption and risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants: the United States national inpatient database [^112EGFtE]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

The study identified 113,445 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants who met the inclusion criteria. The sample comprised 49.5% female infants, 35.5% Caucasians, 75.8% from singleton pregnancies, 33.0% delivered via Cesarean section, and 4.8% small for gestational age. Placental abruption occurred in 2.6% of the mothers of these infants. Infants born to mothers who experienced placental abruption at delivery had a significant association with conditions like chorioamnionitis, placenta previa, breech or malpresentation, and nuchal cord. There was a higher likelihood of being singleton and delivered by Cesarean section, with a lower association with being small for gestational age.

- **Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)**: Overall, IVH was observed in 14.8% of the VLBW infants, with severe IVH occurring in 4.1%. In infants born to mothers with placental abruption, IVH occurred in 18.7%, compared to 14.7% in those without abruption. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) after controlling for confounding variables was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.13–1.38), p < 0.001. Severe IVH occurred in 6.4% of infants born to mothers with placental abruption versus 4.0% in those without, with an adjusted OR of 1.53 (95% CI: 1.30–1.78), p < 0.001.

### Obstetric and neonatal outcomes in clinically diagnosed placental abruption with and without placental histopathologic confirmation-a retrospective study [^114nGcPs]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is a major obstetrical complication with potentially life-threatening consequences. Although the diagnosis of placental abruption is primarily clinical, the nonspecific nature of common presenting symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding and contractions, poses a diagnostic challenge. The contribution of placental pathology in confirming the diagnosis has been debated. This study assessed the clinical significance of related placental lesions by comparing obstetric and neonatal outcomes among cases of placental abruption with versus without supporting histopathologic placental lesions.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed placental abruption cases diagnosed over an eight-year period at a single tertiary center. Maternal, neonatal, and placental outcomes were compared between cases of placental abruption with versus without histopathologic placental lesions. The primary outcome was a composite of severe neonatal morbidity, which included one or more of the following: seizures, intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, blood transfusion, or neonatal death.

- **Results**: A total of 305 clinical placental abruption cases were included in the study. Among these, 95 cases (31.3%) were in the group with histopathologic lesions, while 210 cases (68.8%) were without such lesions. The group with histopathologic lesions was characterized by higher rates of vaginal bleeding at presentation and prematurity (P = 0.012 and P < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, this group had substantially higher rates of composite severe neonatal outcomes (the primary outcome) (P = 0.005).

### The indicators for early blood transfusion in patients with placental abruption with intrauterine fetal death: a retrospective review [^113fLgQz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Placental abruption is a serious obstetric complication with high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, occurring in 0.2–1% of pregnancies, a perinatal mortality rate of 3–12%, and an increased risk of maternal blood transfusion as well as death. When placental abruption is complicated by intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), it is defined as a severe abruption. Such a condition is associated with a high risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which can progress to severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, it is necessary to manage such deliveries at referral medical institutions that are equipped with sufficient blood products and emergency transfusion protocols. PPH, a major cause of maternal mortality, has been reported to cause rapid consumptive or dilutional coagulopathy, especially in cases of placental abruption and amniotic fluid embolism.

Previous studies have identified blood fibrinogen level, Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) DIC score, and shock index (SI) as indicators for blood transfusion in PPH. A decrease in fibrinogen level has also been established as a pointer to the severity of PPH, placental abruption, and the need for blood transfusion. However, factors that determine when placental abruption with IUFD (PA-IUFD) requires blood transfusion have not been identified. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed factors indicating a requirement for early blood transfusion, i.e. initiation of transfusion before apparent/overt DIC, and examined whether the same index as PPH can be useful in patients with PA-IUFD.

### Preterm placental abruption and its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes: A retrospective study [^115mbxvo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Placental abruption (PA) is a severe obstetric complication defined as the partial or complete detachment of a normally situated placenta from the uterine wall before birth, after 20 weeks of gestation. It is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite its clinical importance, the pathogenesis of PA remains unclear, and there is limited research specifically comparing outcomes in term and preterm pregnancies with PA. This study aimed to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by PA based on the timing of PA onset, focusing on differences between term and preterm deliveries.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included a total of 757 singleton pregnant women with confirmed PA from a tertiary obstetrics hospital care center between June 2020 and March 2024. These women were classified into the preterm group (n = 300) and the full-term group (n = 457) based on their gestational age at PA onset. Baseline characteristics, as well as maternal and newborn outcomes, were collected from electronic health records in the hospital information system and further analyzed between the two groups. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes based on term or preterm delivery in women with PA were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Women with preterm delivery had about 3 times greater risk for uterus-placenta apoplexy (aOR: 2.93, 95% CI 1.33–6.47, P = 0.01) and 3 times greater risk for fetal growth restriction (aOR: 3.47, 95% CI 1.45–8.30, P = 0.01).

### Computed tomographic imaging interpretation improves fetal outcomes after maternal trauma [^1162NZS3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has been validated to identify and classify placental abruption following blunt trauma. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate improvement in fetal survival when delivery occurs by protocol at the first sign of class III fetal heart rate tracing in pregnant trauma patients with a viable fetus on arrival and CT evidence of placental perfusion 50% or less secondary to placental abruption.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective review of pregnant trauma patients at 26 weeks' gestation or greater who underwent abdominopelvic CT as part of their initial evaluation. Charts were reviewed for CT interpretation of placental pathology with classification of placental abruption based upon enhancement (Grade 1, > 50% perfusion; Grade 2, 25%-50% perfusion; Grade 3, < 25% perfusion), as well as need for delivery and fetal outcomes.

- **Results**: Forty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Computed tomography revealed evidence of placental abruption in six patients (15%): Grade 1, one patient; Grade 2, one patient; and Grade 3, four patients. Gestational ages ranged from 26 to 39 weeks. All patients with placental abruption of Grade 2 or greater developed concerning fetal heart tracings and underwent delivery emergently at first sign. Abruption was confirmed intraoperatively in all cases. Each birth was viable, and Apgar scores at 10 minutes were greater than 7 in 80% of infants, all of whom were ultimately discharged home. The remaining infant was transferred to an outside facility.

- **Conclusions**: Delivery at the first sign of nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing in these cases was associated with positive outcomes.

### Independent risk factors for placental abruption: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Wjomj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software (version 16.0). Initially, descriptive statistics were conducted on the included studies to understand the study types, sample characteristics, and distribution of risk factors. For the obtained adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), a meta-analysis was conducted using the "metan" command in STATA. In selecting the statistical model, we determined whether to use a fixed-effect model or a random-effects model based on the heterogeneity between studies.

The fixed-effect model assumes that the true effect is the same across all studies, making it suitable for situations with low heterogeneity and providing more precise effect estimates. In contrast, the random-effects model accounts for potential variations in the true effect between studies and is more appropriate for situations with high heterogeneity. During the analysis, we assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and the I² statistic. If the P-value is greater than 0.05 or the I² value is less than 50%, it indicates that heterogeneity is within an acceptable range, and the fixed-effect model was chosen for analysis; otherwise, the random-effects model was applied.

To evaluate publication bias, we used funnel plots for visual analysis. The symmetry of the funnel plot typically reflects the completeness of the study results and the potential for publication bias. If the funnel plot shows asymmetry, this may indicate the presence of publication bias. In such cases, we will discuss this issue and consider its potential impact on the study.

### Placental abruption and child mortality [^116U2ftb]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Placental abruption causes asphyxia and leads to high perinatal mortality. Our objective was to study the overall mortality and causes of death among children born after placental abruption.

- **Methods**: Data on children born from singleton pregnancies complicated by placental abruption between 1987 and 2005 were collected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register, the Hospital Discharge Register, and the Cause-of-Death Register. A reference group consisted of children born from pregnancies without placental abruption. After excluding stillbirths, the final study sample comprised 3,888 children born after placental abruption (index children) and 12,530 referent children. The main outcome measure was overall mortality.

- **Results**: By the end of 2013, there were 280 deaths among the index children and 107 deaths among the referent children. Compared with the referent children, the overall mortality among the index children was significantly increased (hazard ratio: 8.70; 95% confidence interval 6.96–10.90). During the neonatal period (0–27 days), the mortality was nearly 15-fold (14.8; 10.9–20.0), birth-related asphyxia being the leading cause of death (108; 34–341). The mortality remained high during days 28 to 365 (10.3; 4.83–21.8) and beyond 365 days (1.70; 1.03–2.79). Furthermore, the overall mortality was increased among the index children born at 32 to 36 + 6 gestational weeks (2.77; 1.54–4.98) and at ≥ 37 weeks (4.98; 3.54–6.99), and among children with a birth weight of 2500 g or more (5.94; 4.33–8.14).

- **Conclusions**: The impact of abruption on offspring mortality indicates significant risks, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and monitoring for affected pregnancies.

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^113VyQuF]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is multifactorial, with placental abruption being associated with serious neonatal complications attributed to disruption of the maternal-fetal vascular interface. This study aimed to investigate the association between placental abruption and NEC.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the United States (US) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset for the years 2016–2018. Using the logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated to assess the risk of NEC in infants born to mothers with placental abruption after controlling for significant confounders. Analyses were repeated after stratifying the population into two birth weight (BW) categories: < 1500g and ≥ 1500g.

- **Results**: The study included 11,597,756 newborns. Placental abruption occurred in 0.16% of the population. NEC was diagnosed in 0.18% of infants, with a higher incidence (2.5%) in those born to mothers with placental abruption (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3, p < 0.001). Placental abruption was associated with NEC only in infants with BW ≥ 1500g (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11–1.62, p = 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: Placental abruption is associated with an increased risk of NEC in neonates with BW ≥ 1500g. Research is needed to explore the mechanisms behind this association and to develop targeted interventions to mitigate NEC risks in this population.

- **Impact**: Placental abruption is associated with an increased risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates with a birth weight ≥ 1500 grams. This effect could be via direct in utero bowel injury or due to indirect pathways.

### Maternal, labor, delivery, and perinatal outcomes associated with placental abruption: A systematic review [^1114iZaa]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective: Risk factors for placental abruption have changed, but there has not been an updated systematic review investigating outcomes.

Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL for publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2016. We reviewed English-language publications reporting estimated incidence and/or risk factors for maternal, labor, delivery, and perinatal outcomes associated with abruption. We excluded case studies, conference abstracts, and studies that lacked a referent/comparison group or did not clearly characterize placental abruption.

Results: A total of 123 studies were included. Abruption was associated with an elevated risk of cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage and transfusion, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction or low birth weight, perinatal mortality, and cerebral palsy. Additional maternal outcomes included relaparotomy, hysterectomy, sepsis, amniotic fluid embolism, venous thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, and maternal intensive care unit admission. Additional perinatal outcomes included acidosis, encephalopathy, severe respiratory disorders, necrotizing enterocolitis, acute kidney injury, need for resuscitation, chronic lung disease, infant death, and epilepsy.

Conclusion: Few studies examined outcomes beyond the initial birth period, but there is evidence that both mother and child are at risk of additional adverse outcomes. There was also considerable variation in, or absence of, the reporting of abruption definitions.

### Placental abruption leading to hysterectomy [^113BF6gs]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old multigravid patient at 21 weeks gestation presents with major concealed placental abruption and subsequent fetal demise. During an eventually failed misoprostol regimen aiming for vaginal delivery, she develops severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Subsequent hysterotomy reveals a Couvelaire uterus with major hemorrhage, requiring subtotal hysterectomy for hemostasis. This case highlights the severity of the systemic response to abruption and fetal demise in utero and the multifactorial nature of its management.

### Maternal and neonatal safety outcomes after SAR-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117RRbx7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The study explores various outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy.

- **Maternal outcomes**: These include the length of maternal hospitalization, puerperal fever, postpartum hemorrhage, placental abruption, suspected chorioamnionitis, and maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

- **Obstetric outcomes**: Considered factors are miscarriage, birth type, gestational age at delivery, and preterm birth.

- **Neonatal outcomes**: Key observations include neonatal unit admission, Apgar score ≤ 7 at 5 minutes, birth weight, and composite adverse neonatal outcomes. The composite adverse neonatal outcomes encompass any of the following events: intrauterine fetal death, 5-minute Apgar score < 7, NICU admission, and neonatal asphyxia.

- **Data synthesis**: The analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.4. For dichotomous data, the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used. For continuous data, a 95% confidence interval (CI) and mean difference (MD) were pooled. Significance was determined if the p-value was less than 5%. Data were considered heterogeneous when the Chi-Square p-value was less than 0.1 and the I²-value was greater than 50%. A random-effect model was selected for heterogeneous data, and a fixed-effect model for non-heterogeneous data. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on the study design.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 764 summary: Medically indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries [^1178b3Sa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

The neonatal risks of late-preterm and early-term births are well established, and the potential neonatal complications associated with elective delivery at less than 39 0/7 weeks of gestation are well described. However, there are a number of maternal, fetal, and placental complications in which either a late-preterm or early-term delivery is warranted. The timing of delivery in such cases must balance the maternal and newborn risks of late-preterm and early-term delivery with the risks associated with further continuation of pregnancy. Deferring delivery to the 39th week is not recommended if there is a medical or obstetric indication for earlier delivery. If there is a clear indication for a late-preterm or early-term delivery for either maternal or newborn benefit, then delivery should occur regardless of the results of lung maturity testing. Conversely, if delivery could be delayed safely in the context of an immature lung profile result, then no clear indication for a late-preterm or early-term delivery exists. There are also several conditions for which data to guide delivery timing are not available. Some examples of these conditions include uterine dehiscence or chronic placental abruption. Delivery timing in these circumstances should be individualized and based on the clinical situation. This committee opinion is being revised to include frequent obstetric conditions that would necessitate delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and to apply the most up-to-date evidence supporting delivery recommendations.

### Guideline no. 430: Diagnosis and management of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes [^1134Ukvr]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

The diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes requires careful initial evaluation. The SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend assessing the maternal and fetal status to rule out active labor, infection (chorioamnionitis), placental abruption, or fetal distress, as these conditions necessitate immediate delivery once PPROM is diagnosed.

### Placental abruption and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with birth weight ≥ 1500 grams; US national database study [^112gbMF9]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

African American newborns are more vulnerable to developing NEC than those of other ethnicities. There is no clear explanation for ethnic disparities in neonatal NEC; however, other studies have shown the vulnerability of African American neonates to various diseases such as acute kidney injury and bilirubin neurotoxicity.

NEC was more frequently encountered in males than in females. Male vulnerability to NEC is consistent with the broader phenomenon known as the "Y chromosome effect", which identifies males as being more prone to various morbidities and mortality in both the fetal stage and early postnatal period, including prematurity, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. – **The biological foundations**: The mechanisms underlying this sex disparity remain obscure, and theories have speculated the roles of factors such as testosterone levels, heightened fetal metabolic rates, and molecular aberrations.

This study did not demonstrate an association between placental abruption and NEC in VLBW infants. One of the explanations for the lack of association between placental abruption and NEC would be the coexistence of multiple other risk factors in VLBW infants that would have more importance in the pathogenesis of NEC than placental abruption, such as SGA, neonatal anemia, and neonatal sepsis. In addition, VLBW infants suffer from intestinal dysbiosis and consequently are at a significantly increased risk of NEC. Placental abruption is mostly an acute event leading to emergency delivery; however, on some occasions, abruption is subacute.

### Placental abruption remote from term associated with Q fever infection [^1151qEij]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that Q fever infection in pregnancy is associated with various maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal death, and oligohydramnios.

- **Case**: We describe the cases of two pregnant women remote from term who presented with premature contractions and fever of unknown origin. During their hospitalizations, they experienced the development of near-complete placental abruption. In both cases, immediate delivery ensued. Fever of unknown origin work-up revealed chronic Q fever infection, and polymerase chain reaction investigation of the placenta demonstrated chronic Q fever placentitis.

- **Conclusion**: Q fever placentitis may result in placental abruption remote from term. Therefore, in endemic areas, the diagnosis of Q fever requires appropriate surveillance and prenatal care.
