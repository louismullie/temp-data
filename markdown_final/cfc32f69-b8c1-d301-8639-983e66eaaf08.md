## Question

Hypercalcemia can cause diarrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hypercalcemia can cause diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic gastrointestinal manifestations of hypercalcemia and whether diarrhea is listed among them. Then, I should verify if there are credible case reports or series documenting diarrhea in the setting of hypercalcemia. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility for diarrhea in hypercalcemia, including motility and secretory effects. After that, I need to check for confounders and indirect causes of diarrhea in hypercalcemic patients, such as medications or concurrent endocrine tumors. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline the clinical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the canonical symptom profile of hypercalcemia. The authoritative reviews consistently describe gastrointestinal effects as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, and constipation, with constipation being particularly characteristic due to impaired neuromuscular excitability and reduced smooth muscle contractility; diarrhea is not included in these classic descriptions, which already makes me cautious about asserting a direct causal link [^f92ff096] [^705d10a2] [^e2965d35] [^614e1e03].

> Wait, let me verify whether any high-quality sources explicitly mention diarrhea. The Endocrine Society guideline for hypercalcemia of malignancy lists gastrointestinal symptoms as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain, without listing diarrhea, reinforcing that diarrhea is not a typical manifestation of hypercalcemia itself [^d92d9ce7]. Similarly, FDA labeling for calcium salts and hypercalcemia warnings emphasize constipation and other GI effects, not diarrhea, which supports the notion that diarrhea is not expected from hypercalcemia per se [^05c54993] [^2dc32276].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for exceptions. I found a case report of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia in which the patient had diarrhea and confusion, suggesting that while uncommon, diarrhea can occur in hypercalcemic states, albeit likely via indirect mechanisms or concurrent disease processes rather than a direct effect of calcium on intestinal secretion or motility [^d8f24905]. I also need to consider that severe hypercalcemia can precipitate pancreatitis, which itself can present with diarrhea, providing a plausible indirect pathway in select cases [^e4954892].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Hypercalcemia reduces neuromuscular excitability and smooth muscle contractility, which physiologically predisposes to hypomotility and constipation rather than diarrhea; this aligns with the classic constipation phenotype and argues against a direct secretory diarrhea mechanism from elevated calcium alone [^614e1e03] [^de0564c2]. Let me reconsider whether calcium-sensing receptor activation in the gut could alter secretion; while CaSR signaling can modulate intestinal function, the dominant clinical effect of hypercalcemia remains reduced motility and constipation, not diarrhea, so any secretory effect would be speculative and not well supported clinically [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the diarrhea is due to the underlying cause of hypercalcemia rather than hypercalcemia itself. I should double-check for endocrine tumors that both raise calcium and cause diarrhea. VIPomas frequently cause profuse secretory diarrhea and are reported in about half of cases to have hypercalcemia, likely via cosecretion of PTHrP, so the diarrhea is tumor-driven rather than a direct effect of elevated serum calcium on the bowel [^919fffd3]. Similarly, calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia in lymphoma can increase intestinal calcium absorption, but again, diarrhea is not a hallmark symptom of hypercalcemia itself in these entities [^1834baf9].

> Next, I should review medication-related confounders. Bisphosphonates used to treat hypercalcemia can themselves cause diarrhea as an adverse effect, so diarrhea reported in treated hypercalcemic patients may be iatrogenic rather than a manifestation of hypercalcemia; denosumab labeling also lists diarrhea among common adverse reactions in hypercalcemia of malignancy studies, which complicates attribution when evaluating symptom causality in treated cohorts [^53263262] [^73440a7b]. I need to ensure that when diarrhea accompanies hypercalcemia, I consider the treatment agents and the underlying disease before concluding calcium is the cause [^53263262].

> Let me synthesize. Direct evidence that hypercalcemia itself causes diarrhea is sparse and inconsistent with the well-established constipation-predominant GI phenotype of hypercalcemia; rare reports of diarrhea in hypercalcemic patients likely reflect indirect mechanisms such as pancreatitis, concurrent secretory tumors like VIPoma, or adverse effects of therapies such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, rather than a primary secretory or motility effect of elevated calcium on the intestine [^f92ff096] [^d8f24905] [^919fffd3] [^53263262]. Therefore, I should conclude that hypercalcemia does not typically cause diarrhea, and when diarrhea is present, I need to actively search for alternative etiologies and confounders rather than attributing it to hypercalcemia alone [^f92ff096] [^d92d9ce7].

> Clinically, I need to ensure a structured approach. If a patient with hypercalcemia has diarrhea, I should confirm the calcium level and chronicity, review medications including calcium, vitamin D, thiazides, lithium, and any recent bisphosphonate or denosumab exposure, and screen for endocrine tumors such as VIPoma or PTHrP-secreting malignancies; I should also consider pancreatitis and malabsorption as indirect contributors, and I should avoid anchoring on hypercalcemia as the cause of diarrhea without excluding these alternatives [^f92ff096] [^919fffd3] [^53263262]. Management should prioritize correcting the hypercalcemia and its underlying cause while independently evaluating and treating the diarrhea, recognizing that resolving hypercalcemia alone may not stop the diarrhea if the true cause lies elsewhere [^d92d9ce7].

---

Hypercalcemia does not typically cause **diarrhea**; instead, it more often leads to **constipation** due to reduced intestinal motility [^f92ff096] [^614e1e03]. Diarrhea is not a classic symptom of hypercalcemia and, when present, usually reflects **coexisting conditions** (e.g. VIPoma, medication effects, or malabsorption) rather than hypercalcemia itself [^919fffd3] [^53263262]. If diarrhea occurs in a hypercalcemic patient, evaluate for **alternative causes** and treat the underlying disorder [^c6488947].

---

## Gastrointestinal effects of hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia affects multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [^f92ff096]. The **classic GI manifestations** of hypercalcemia include:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common in moderate to severe hypercalcemia [^f92ff096].
- **Constipation**: Reduced intestinal motility due to impaired neuromuscular function [^614e1e03].
- **Abdominal pain**: Often nonspecific and associated with other GI symptoms [^notfound].
- **Pancreatitis**: Occurs in severe hypercalcemia, though it is relatively rare [^e2965d35].

Diarrhea is notably absent from the **classic GI symptom constellation** of hypercalcemia, suggesting that it is not a typical manifestation [^f92ff096].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypercalcemia to gastrointestinal symptoms

Hypercalcemia impairs GI function primarily by **reducing neuromuscular excitability**, leading to decreased smooth muscle contractility and slowed intestinal transit [^614e1e03]. This mechanism explains the predominance of constipation rather than diarrhea in hypercalcemic patients [^de0564c2]. Additionally, hypercalcemia can cause **pancreatitis**, which may present with abdominal pain and, rarely, diarrhea secondary to malabsorption [^e2965d35].

---

## Evidence regarding diarrhea in hypercalcemia

A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that diarrhea is **not a common or expected symptom** of hypercalcemia [^f92ff096]. The classic teaching and clinical experience consistently emphasize constipation as the primary GI manifestation of hypercalcemia [^614e1e03]. However, isolated case reports and clinical observations have documented diarrhea in patients with hypercalcemia, but these cases typically involve **coexisting conditions** or medications that independently cause diarrhea [^d8f24905].

---

## Clinical scenarios where diarrhea may coexist with hypercalcemia

While diarrhea is not a direct consequence of hypercalcemia, certain clinical scenarios may present with both hypercalcemia and diarrhea:

- **VIPoma**: A neuroendocrine tumor secreting vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), causing profuse watery diarrhea and often associated with hypercalcemia [^919fffd3].
- **Medication-induced diarrhea**: Certain chemotherapeutic agents and bisphosphonates used in the treatment of hypercalcemia can cause diarrhea as a side effect [^53263262].
- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Conditions such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease can cause both diarrhea and secondary hypercalcemia due to vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

When evaluating a patient with hypercalcemia and diarrhea, it is essential to consider **alternative etiologies** for the diarrhea, such as:

- **Infectious diarrhea**: Bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections [^c6488947].
- **Medication-induced diarrhea**: Side effects of chemotherapeutic agents, bisphosphonates, or other drugs [^53263262].
- **Endocrine tumors**: VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome, or other neuroendocrine tumors [^919fffd3].
- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or pancreatic insufficiency [^notfound].

Management should focus on correcting the hypercalcemia through hydration, bisphosphonates, or calcitonin, while simultaneously **investigating and treating the underlying cause** of the diarrhea [^d92d9ce7].

---

## Conclusion

Hypercalcemia does not typically cause **diarrhea**; the classic GI manifestation is **constipation** due to reduced intestinal motility [^f92ff096]. When diarrhea coexists with hypercalcemia, evaluate for alternative causes such as VIPoma, medication effects, or malabsorption syndromes [^919fffd3] [^53263262].

### Association between daily calcium intake and the prevalence of chronic diarrhea: an analysis of NHANES 2005–2010 data [^4919f797]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal disorder that has a significant impact on global health, with a prevalence of up to 5% in the population. It leads to a substantial increase in healthcare costs and severely reduces patients' quality of life. Chronic diarrhea not only severely affects the quality of life of patients but also leads to complications such as malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which can further negatively impact health. Although the causes of chronic diarrhea are complex and diverse, including infectious factors, intestinal inflammation, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and medication side effects, in recent years, dietary factors have gained attention as important contributors to chronic diarrhea.

Calcium, an essential trace element for the human body, plays a crucial role not only in maintaining bone health but also in physiological functions such as muscle contraction and nerve transmission. By regulating muscle contraction and acting as a mediator of nerve signals, calcium ensures the proper functioning of the muscular and nervous systems. Studies have shown that calcium intake plays a crucial role in regulating intestinal absorption and secretion. Calcium helps regulate the contraction of intestinal smooth muscle, thereby influencing gut motility. These functions suggest that calcium may play an important role in maintaining gastrointestinal function and fluid balance. Although the physiological functions of calcium have been extensively studied, its intake and its relationship with gastrointestinal health, particularly the risk of diarrhea, have not received sufficient attention. Current research mainly focuses on the effects of calcium on bones and muscles, while its role in the digestive system has been less explored. Specifically, the association between calcium intake and the risk of chronic diarrhea lacks large-scale epidemiological evidence, and further studies are needed to explore its potential role in reducing diarrhea incidence.

To address this gap, this study utilizes data from the 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States to analyze the association between daily calcium intake and the prevalence of chronic diarrhea. This research employs weighted logistic regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to explore both linear and potential non-linear associations, offering a more comprehensive analysis. Subgroup analyses are conducted to examine potential effect modifications across different population groups. The findings will provide new epidemiological evidence supporting a better understanding of the role of calcium in gastrointestinal health and offer scientific insights for future public health interventions and dietary guidelines.

### Calcium ameliorates diarrhea in immunocompromised children [^5b90c879]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of infectious diarrheas remains a challenge, particularly in immunocompromised patients in whom infections usually persist and resultant diarrhea is often severe and protracted. Children with infectious diarrhea who become dehydrated are normally treated with oral or intravenous rehydration therapy. Although rehydration therapy can replace the loss of fluid, it does not ameliorate diarrhea. Thus, during the last decades, there has been continuous effort to search for ways to safely stop diarrhea. Herein, we report 3 immunocompromised children who developed severe and/or protracted infectious diarrhea. Their diarrheas were successfully "halted" within 1 to 2 days following the administration of calcium.

### Association between daily calcium intake and the prevalence of chronic diarrhea: an analysis of NHANES 2005–2010 data [^e5d5b1e4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The negative association between calcium intake and the prevalence of diarrhea may be explained by several mechanisms: (1) Enhancement of intestinal barrier function: Calcium may enhance intestinal barrier function by promoting tight junction proteins (e.g. occludin and claudin), which helps reduce intestinal permeability and inflammation. This mechanism is plausible, but further research is needed to confirm its relevance in chronic diarrhea. (2) Reduction of intestinal inflammation: Calcium has anti-inflammatory effects and may reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially lowering the incidence of diarrhea. However, this requires more investigation in the context of chronic diarrhea. (3) Regulation of gut microbiota: Calcium may influence gut microbiota balance, potentially inhibiting harmful pathogens like ETEC and promoting beneficial bacteria. However, the exact role of calcium in gut microbiota regulation remains an emerging area of research and needs further exploration. (4) Chelation of bile acids and fatty acids: Calcium binds to bile acids and fatty acids, forming insoluble complexes that may reduce irritation to the intestinal lining and lower diarrhea risk. This mechanism has been observed in other studies, though its specific role in chronic diarrhea needs further confirmation. (5) Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation: Calcium activates CaSR, which helps regulate intestinal motility and fluid balance, potentially reducing secretory and inflammatory diarrhea. More research is needed to understand its full impact on chronic diarrhea. Our findings suggests that increasing calcium intake may help individuals with chronic diarrhea, though recommendations should be individualized. Dairy products and calcium-fortified plant foods are good dietary sources. Calcium supplements may also be considered if necessary, but proper dosage is important. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings for practical application in treatment.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^f92ff096]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^53263262]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults — antiresorptive therapy recommendation and evidence: In adults with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), we recommend treatment with an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab) compared with management without an intravenous (IV) BP or Dmab (1⊕⊕⊕O). The panel notes that no clinical studies have directly compared the effectiveness of BPs vs Dmab for adults with HCM. In combined analyses of 4 placebo-controlled BP studies, 61.3% of BP-treated patients experienced resolution of HCM versus 27.5% with placebo (rate ratio [RR] 2.22; 95% CI 1.57 to 3.14). Mortality did not differ significantly (RR 1.52; 95% CI 0.91 to 2.53). Adverse events were more common with BP treatment (RR, 2.33; 95% CI 1.16 to 4.69), with the most common adverse events being fever, infusion site reactions, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, nausea, diarrhea, and abnormal taste. Rebound HCM has been associated with Dmab discontinuation in patients with metastatic malignancies.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^44e8c094]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications of Medical Therapy

Important side effects complicate treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets. Phosphate salts cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including dyspepsia and a laxative effect. Decreasing the dose and gradual upward titration may improve tolerability.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is commonly present prior to starting treatment in XLH, but is also worsened by phosphate salts. Secondary hyperparathyroidism affects over 80% of patients with XLH, and up to 25% to 30% of adults with XLH develop hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism during conventional therapy, with lower rates in childhood. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism tends to occur with higher phosphate doses and longer durations of treatment. A calcimimetic (ie, cinacalcet) may be attempted; however, insurance approval may be a barrier, and nausea is a common side effect. Regarding surgical intervention, resection of multiple parathyroid glands is typically required due to multigland hyperplasia. Risks include persistent hypercalcemia after incomplete resection, recurrence of hypercalcemia years later, or postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Metabolic emergencies

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia is the most common metabolic emergency in cancer patients, occurring in approximately 20–30% of patients. Most common tumor types associated with hypercalcemia are breast, kidney and lung cancer, and multiple myeloma, although it also occurs in digestive tumors such as esophageal cancer. Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy often have a bad prognosis. Hypercalcemia occurs either by osteolytic metastases or by tumor production of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) or parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Clinically, patients are often asymptomatic until reaching high levels. Then neurologic changes occur such as fatigue, muscle weakness, stupor and coma. Hypercalcemia may also cause cardiac abnormalities such as arrhythmias, heart block and even cardiac arrest. GI symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, ileus, constipation, and, in rare cases, pancreatitis. Often patients complain of polyuria and polydipsia due to inability of concentrating the urine, and, as the hypercalcemia persists, progressive renal insufficiency occurs (caused by calcium deposits in the kidney).

Aggressive treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In general, patients with calcium > 14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) require therapy with volume expansion with isotonic saline to maintain sufficient urine output. For short-term management (in the first 48 h), calcitonin can be used which increases renal calcium excretion an decreases bone resorption via interference with osteoclast function. Furthermore, biphosphonates (preferably zoledronic acid) should be administered for longer term control of hypercalcemia, with a maximum effect after 2–4 days. Since bisphosphonates are potentially nephrotoxic, caution is warranted when used in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction in combination with adequate hydration may minimize the risk. As a last option, hemodialysis is an effective treatment.

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia can be divided based on severity (serum total Ca levels) to mild (< 3 mmol/L), moderate (3 — 3.5 mmol/L) and severe (> 3.5 mmol/L). It may be caused by increased bone resorption, increased gastrointestinal Ca absorption, or decreased renal Ca excretion. Approximately 90% of reported cases stem from primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. In these instances, there is an increased release of calcium from the bones and intestines, typically accompanied by potential impairment in renal clearance. Generally, the causes of hypercalcemia may be divided into two categories- PTH-mediated and non-PTH-mediated. The various causes of hypercalcemia are depicted in Table 10. The onset of hypercalcemia related symptoms typically occurs when the total serum calcium concentration ranges from 3 to 3.75 mmol/L. At lower levels, individuals may experience neurologic symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and confusion. Higher levels can lead to more severe manifestations, including hallucinations, seizures, disorientation, and hypotonicity. Hypercalcemia also disrupts the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, potentially resulting in diuresis and subsequent dehydration. The cardiovascular symptoms associated with hypercalcemia can be variable. Initially, there may be an increase in myocardial contractility until the calcium levels reach around 3.75 mmol/L. Beyond this threshold, myocardial depression occurs which can lead to decreased automaticity and shortened ventricular systole. Arrhythmias may result from a shortened refractory period. Additionally, hypercalcemia has the potential to exacerbate digitalis toxicity and contribute to hypertension. A significant number of individuals with hypercalcemia experience hypokalemia, and these conditions can collectively cause cardiac arrhythmias. As the serum calcium surpasses 3.25 mmol/L, there is a typical shortening of the QT interval, accompanied by prolonged QRS and PR intervals as well. The progression of these abnormalities may lead to the development of atrioventricular block, which can lead to complete heart block. In severe instances, cardiac arrest can occur when the total serum calcium reaches 3.75 to 5 mmol/L. Additionally, hypercalcemia manifests gastrointestinal symptoms such as pancreatitis, constipation, dysphagia, and peptic ulcers. Renal effects involve a reduced capacity to concentrate urine which can result in diuresis and subsequent loss of crucial ions. The clinical manifestations and interpretation of hypercalcemia levels are summarized in Table 11.

PTH is the only approved skeletal anabolic agent for the treatment of human osteoporosis. Unlike PTH, which is a mixed anabolic and catabolic agent, PTHrP displays features suggesting that it may be a pure anabolic agent when intermittently administered. The full dose range of PTHrP is unknown.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to define the complete therapeutic window and dose-limiting toxicities of PTHrP. The secondary objective was to determine whether PTHrP retains a pure anabolic profile at the highest usable doses.

Design

This was a single-blinded, two-part, dose-escalating clinical trial.

Setting

The study was conducted in a university academic setting.

Patients Or Other Participants

Participants included 41 healthy postmenopausal women between the ages of 45 and 75 yr.

Intervention

INTERVENTIONs included PTHrP(1–36) or placebo in a dose-escalating design for 3 wk.

Main Outcome Measures

Safety measures (hypercalcemia, nausea, vomiting, hemodynamics, flushing, miscellaneous) and bone turnover markers were measured.

Results

Intermittent PTHrP was administered safely and without serious adverse events in subjects receiving 500 and 625 microg/d for 3 wk. Subjects receiving 750 microg/d developed mild hypercalcemia. Bone turnover markers suggested that even at the highest doses, daily sc PTHrP may not activate bone resorption, i.e. may be purely anabolic. Interestingly, when hypercalcemia occurred, it may have resulted not from bone resorption but from activation of intestinal calcium absorption by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D.

Conclusions

In doses as high as 750 microg/d, in contrast to PTH, intermittently administered PTHrP appears to act as a pure skeletal anabolic agent. Surprisingly, PTHrP in the high doses studied activates 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D production. Dosing information obtained herein can be used to design a longer term head-to-head comparative efficacy trial of PTHrP vs. PTH.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^752c52f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency presenting with failure to thrive, hypercalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis [^f2d387d4]. BMC Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Disaccharide Intolerance Type I (Mendelian Interance in Man database: *222900) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from mutation in sucrase-isomaltase (Enzyme Catalyzed 3.2.1.48). Usually, infants with SI deficiency come to attention because of chronic diarrhea and nutritional evidence of malabsorption.

Case Presentation

We describe an atypical presentation of this disorder in a 10-month-old infant. In addition to chronic diarrhea, the child displayed severe and chronic hypercalcemia, the evaluation of which was negative. An apparently coincidental right orbital hemangioma was detected. Following identification of the SI deficiency, an appropriately sucrose-restricted, but normal calcium diet regimen was instituted which led to cessation of diarrhea, substantial weight gain, and resolution of hypercalcemia.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that, similar to congenital lactase deficiency (Mendelian Interance in Man database: *223000, Alactasia, Hereditary Disaccharide Intolerance Type II), hypercalcemia may complicate neonatal Sucrase-Isomaltase deficiency. Hypercalcemia in the presence of chronic diarrhea should suggest disaccharide intolerance in young infants.

### The parathyroids and the gut [^614e1e03]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

This review discusses gastrointestinal manifestations of parathyroid diseases. Parathyroid hormone is the primary regulator of calcium physiology. Hypoparathyroidism can be idiopathic, hereditary, or secondary to surgery in the neck. Hyperparathyroidism is usually from adenomas or hyperplasia. Hypoparathyroidism is associated with steatorrhea that may improve with medium-chain triglycerides, correction of the hypoparathyroidism, or administration of vitamin D. Hyperparathyroidism results in constipation because of reduction in neuromuscular excitability by high calcium levels. According to old literature, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in patients with hyperparathyroidism is 9% compared with autopsy rates of 4% to 5%. Any association is difficult to prove today, as hyperparathyroidism is usually mild due to early detection of cases through routine automated measurements of calcium. In addition, PUD is less prevalent now than before the advent of proton pump inhibitors. The presence of ulcers or ulcer symptoms may correct in some patients after parathyroidectomy, suggesting an association. The incidence of pancreatitis in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism ranges from 1.5% to 12% and may be because of the hypercalcemia. Complicating the issue is secondary hyperparathyroidism in response to hypocalcemia from pancreatitis. Pancreatitis may improve in some individuals after parathyroidectomy. Pancreatitis may follow parathyroid surgery because of an acute rise in calcium levels with manipulation of the parathyroid glands or to a blunted response of calcitonin-producing cells from fatigue. Parathyroid diseases have a few distinct effects on the gut: steatorrhea in hypoparathyroidism, and constipation, PUD, and pancreatitis in hyperparathyroidism.

### Hypercalcemic disorders in children [^5c30d081]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is defined as a serum calcium concentration that is greater than two standard deviations above the normal mean, which in children may vary with age and sex, reflecting changes in the normal physiology at each developmental stage. Hypercalcemic disorders in children may present with hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, lethargy, polyuria, dehydration, failure to thrive, and seizures. In severe cases renal failure, pancreatitis and reduced consciousness may also occur and older children and adolescents may present with psychiatric symptoms. The causes of hypercalcemia in children can be classified as parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent or PTH-independent, and may be congenital or acquired. PTH-independent hypercalcemia, ie, hypercalcemia associated with a suppressed PTH, is commoner in children than PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. Acquired causes of PTH-independent hypercalcemia in children include hypervitaminosis; granulomatous disorders, and endocrinopathies. Congenital syndromes associated with PTH-independent hypercalcemia include idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), William's syndrome, and inborn errors of metabolism. PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is usually caused by parathyroid tumors, which may give rise to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which usually arises in association with chronic renal failure and in the treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets. Acquired causes of PTH-dependent hypercalcemia in neonates include maternal hypocalcemia and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. PHPT usually occurs as an isolated nonsyndromic and nonhereditary endocrinopathy, but may also occur as a hereditary hypercalcemic disorder such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, and familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism, and less commonly, as part of inherited complex syndromic disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). Advances in identifying the genetic causes have resulted in increased understanding of the underlying biological pathways and improvements in diagnosis. The management of symptomatic hypercalcemia includes interventions such as fluids, antiresorptive medications, and parathyroid surgery.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^cc3a1e96]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca²⁺ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild‐to‐moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol‐mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia (Table 2). Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D. The paracellular pathway can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport. The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption. In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years and when the hypercalcemia is mild (ie, less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]) patients often have relatively few symptoms. When the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, so called parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism. Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low‐normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is elevated in patients with PHPT and correlates positively with serum calcium and PTH and negatively with levels of serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. However, in a multiple regression analysis only serum calcium and creatinine clearance were predictors of FGF23, and serum levels of FGF23 did not change after curative surgery, suggesting that this hormone is not likely to play a major role in mediating the hypophosphatemia seen in PHPT. Vitamin D deficiency is also frequently seen in PHPT and can exacerbate its severity.

Because, as just noted, the more well‐established consequences of dysregulated parathyroid function are covered elsewhere in this series, the remainder of this section is devoted to selected new and emerging aspects of the pathophysiology of PHPT as well as to areas of uncertainty.

### Pharmacological management of diarrhea [^df1da3b7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 2 billion annual cases of diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years and kills 1.5 million children each year. It is especially prevalent in the developing world, where mortality is related to dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and the resultant acidosis, and in 2001, it accounted for 1.78 million deaths (3.7% of total deaths) in low- and middle-income countries. However, diarrhea is also a common problem in the developed world, with 211 million to 375 million episodes of infectious diarrheal illnesses in the United States annually, resulting in 73 million physician consultations, 1.8 million hospitalizations, and 3100 deaths. Furthermore, 4% to 5% of the Western population suffers from chronic diarrhea. Given the high prevalence of diarrhea, research has been directed at learning more about the cellular mechanisms underlying diarrheal illnesses in order to develop new medications directed at novel cellular targets. These cellular mechanisms and targets are discussed in this article.

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

Denosumab was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 20070315) in which 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [see Clinical Trials (14.4)].

The adverse reaction profile of denosumab in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, 20050103, 20062004, and 20040215. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients were nausea (30%), dyspnea (27%), decreased appetite (24%), headache (24%), peripheral edema (24%), vomiting (24%), anemia (21%), constipation (21%), and diarrhea (21%). The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on-study: fatigue (3%) and infection (6%). Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia (3%), hypokalemia (3%), and hypophosphatemia (76%) of patients. No deaths on-study were related to denosumab therapy.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of denosumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypocalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, including fatal cases [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Hypercalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation can occur [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Severe hypercalcemia and a pelvic Brown tumor in an adolescent with primary hyperparathyroidism: a case report [^f254cb33]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Hypercalcemia is a relatively rare presentation in the pediatric population, however, an approach to the differential diagnosis and awareness of initial management steps is important for the general pediatrician. While hypercalcemia in neonates and infants includes a number of genetic and iatrogenic possibilities, the diagnosis in the adolescent – much like in adults – is most commonly due to one of three aetiologies: hyperparathyroidism, malignancy or immobilization. Given the large palpable abdominal mass found in our patient, initial assessments were highly suspicious for an underlying malignancy. However, biochemical and radiologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and proved the abdominal mass to be due to constipation and fecal impaction secondary to severe hypercalcemia.

Initial management for all patients with severe symptomatic hypercalcemia must begin with IV fluid administration for dilution and subsequent renal excretion of excess calcium. Hypercalcemia can induce dehydration through impaired oral intake and is compounded by possible development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Additional therapies to reduce serum calcium levels may include antiresorptive agents (i.e. bisphosphonates), calcitonin, forced calciuresis, and corticosteroids. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic activity and hinder hydroxyapatite breakdown, a mineral composed of calcium and phosphate. Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption and forces renal excretion of calcium, but its effect is limited due to development of tachyphylaxis within days of initial exposure. Facilitating calciuresis through diuretic use, such as furosemide, should be delayed until intravascular volume has been replaced. The use of corticosteroids is potentially beneficial in select etiologies of hypercalcemia that are primarily mediated by excessive production of activated vitamin D (ex. granulomatous diseases).

This patient highlights several unique aspects to the presentation of hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the excessive secretion of PTH by one or multiple parathyroid glands. PTH promotes bone catabolism of cortical bone and bone anabolism of cancellous bone. This was demonstrated here with a relative reduction in BMD of the distal 1/3 forearm – a primarily cortical site – and minimal impact on BMD of the lumbar spine – predominantly trabecular. Osteolytic lesions such as brown tumors manifest in severe and prolonged courses of hyperparathyroidism and excessive osteoclastic activity. Renal involvement from hyperparathyroidism is more frequent than bone involvement and manifests with hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. Neuropsychological symptoms are also associated with hypercalcemia and include nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, depression and anxiety as well as complaints of decreased memory and concentration, loss of initiative, irritability, and disturbed sleep.

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy

Previous estimates of hypercalcaemia of malignancy reported that it occurred in 5–30% of patients with cancer. However, prevalence rates have fallen progressively with the widespread, early and prolonged use of agents that inhibit bone resorption. A recent observational study in patients with cancer of any type or stage found that the 2012 hypercalcaemia prevalence was 0.67%; prevalence estimates varied across cancer types and were highest for individuals with lung cancer, multiple myeloma, or stage IV cancer. Similarly, a recent US study reported a hypercalcaemia prevalence of 2–2.8% among all patients with cancer, ranging from 1.4–2.1% in prostate cancer, to 7.5–10.2% in multiple myeloma. Furthermore, both studies examined the prevalence of hypercalcaemia in patients with cancer and not specifically hypercalcaemia of malignancy; therefore, the prevalence of true hypercalcaemia of malignancy is likely to be lower. Indeed, a study of 642 patients diagnosed with hypercalcaemia of malignancy reported that up to one third of cases were not caused by tumour-related factors.

Signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia include polyuria, nausea and vomiting, constipation, weakness, obtundation, and, in severe cases, coma. Early symptoms can be mild and difficult to distinguish from the underlying cancer or side effects of cancer therapy. When hypercalcaemia of malignancy is suspected, blood calcium concentrations should be measured; total blood calcium concentrations, adjusted for albumin, above 10.2 mg/dL are diagnostic of hypercalcaemia. It should be noted, however, that disease development and the severity of symptoms are related to both the absolute blood calcium level and to the rate of increase.

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy can occur in patients with or without osteolytic bone metastases and is thus classified as osteolytic or humoral, respectively. Elevation of circulating PTHrP level has a central role in the pathogenesis of both humoral and osteolytic hypercalcaemia of malignancy. A study of 30 patients with solid tumours and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy revealed that up to 80% of individuals had raised plasma PTHrP concentrations compared with healthy controls. Elevated circulating PTHrP levels have also been reported in 65% of patients with bone metastases and hypercalcaemia.

### Endocrine society hypercalcemia of malignancy guidelines… [^d92d9ce7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In adults with severe HCM, combination therapy with calcitonin and an IV BP or Dmab is suggested. For refractory or recurrent HCM despite treatment with IV BP, Dmab is suggested. Symptoms range from fatigue, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia with mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia to cognitive. dysfunction, kidney failure, and arrhythmias with rapidly rising calcium levels or severe hypercalcemia. 1 Pathophysiology followed by HCM can include production of parathyroid hormone–related peptides, bone metastases releasing osteoclast activating factors, and excess production of calcitriol.

2 Treatment of HCM begins with intravenous hydration, potent antiresorptive agents, and calcitonin for severe hypercalcemia. Of the 8 recommendations, 1 recommendation was rated as strong given the life-threatening nature of HCM, with the rest conditional. All 8 were based on very low certainty of evidence due to limited prospective evidence and variation in study end points pertaining to outcomes relevant for HCM. The conditional recommendation for Dmab vs IV BP to treat HCM was inferred from indirect evidence of effectiveness in treating patients with malignancy and bone metastases independent of baseline serum calcium levels. Cinacalcet is effective for hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, but gastrointestinal adverse effects may limit dose escalation and its efficacy as a single-drug therapy.

Treatment with IV BP and Dmab can lower SCa levels within days and provide durable calcium-lowering effects. Both agents carry the small but significant risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. Treatment with IV BPs is associated with kidney failure, acute phase reactions, and hypocalcemia. While Dmab is safe for those with kidney insufficiency, higher rates of hypocalcemia have been observed. Additionally, Dmab carries the risk of rebound bone loss and fractures with discontinuation. 3.

Calcitriol-associated hypercalcemia of malignancy — pathophysiology and role of glucocorticoids: Ectopic production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) is a less common HCM mechanism almost exclusively seen with lymphomas, leading to increased calcium and phosphorus absorption from the GI tract and increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; glucocorticoids interfere with GI calcium absorption and inhibit the 1-α-hydroxylase enzyme, limiting conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to calcitriol; restriction of dietary calcium intake is required, yet patients with calcitriol-mediated HCM often continue to have hypercalcemia despite glucocorticoid treatment.

### Managing primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care [^963abae1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with calcium concentrations above 3 mmol/L typically start to develop symptoms of hypercalcaemia, which can include nausea, vomiting, thirst and polyuria, malaise, confusion, lowered pain threshold and coma. Milder hypercalcaemia (calcium concentrations < 3 mmol/L) is often asymptomatic, and the problem is therefore usually discovered as an incidental finding on routine biochemical screening. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcaemia. Here, we consider the recognition and further management of patients presenting with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care.

### Surviving extreme hypercalcaemia – a case report and review of the literature [^54e3f10e]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of extreme hypercalcaemia associated with a parathyroid adenoma in a young man. The patient presented with classical symptoms of a hypercalcaemic syndrome, and serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 6.92 mmol L⁻¹ and 70.2 pmol L⁻¹ respectively. After stabilizing the patient and reducing the calcium level, a parathyroidectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful with rapidly resolving clinical symptoms. Hypercalcaemic crisis is a rare but life-threatening complication of primary hyperparathyroidism. It should be suspected in acutely ill patients complaining of muscular weakness, gastrointestinal and cerebral symptoms. To reduce mortality, it is essential to correctly diagnose the condition without delay and provide appropriate emergency management correcting hypercalcaemia and dehydration. Successful parathyroidectomy quickly relieves symptoms and prevents recurrence.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^3f08c832]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary calcium levels

Mean (± SD) 24‐hour urinary calcium excretion was 189.8 (± 131.6) mg pre‐treatment, 192.3 (± 146.0) mg at the middle (end of week 8), and 140.5 (± 82.4) mg at the end of the study (end of week 16). A non‐significant change from baseline mean 24‐hour urinary calcium was observed over the 16‐week treatment period (26%, p = .07). A total of 80% of the subjects had a decrease in urinary calcium levels by the end of the study. There were 7 subjects who began the trial with calcium levels above the 24‐hour urinary calcium reference range (> 200 mg for females; > 250 mg for males). These subjects had a mean decrease of 21% in comparison to their baseline levels. Notably, 6 of the 7 subjects had a decrease in 24‐hour urinary calcium levels, 3 of which decreased to reference range levels.

Safety

During the 120‐day study period, 18 of the 19 patients had at least one adverse event. A total of 199 AEs were reported. The vast majority of AEs (195/199, 98.0%) were deemed unrelated to the study drug. The four AEs considered drug‐related (mild nausea, moderate back pain, moderate headache, and moderate upper abdominal pain) were reported by a single subject who withdrew consent on day 1 after expressing fear of participating in the study. These AEs are unlikely related but, because this could not be confirmed by repeated dosing, they were recorded as "possibly related". Aside from the one patient who withdrew from the study because of hypercalcemia on day 1 before receiving the first dose of the study, there were no other incidences of hypercalcemia adverse events, and no patient had serum ACa greater than 9.42 mg/dL over the course of the treatment period. The most commonly observed adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (reported by 37%, 32%, and 26% of the patients, respectively), nasopharyngitis (32%), and muscle spasms (26%). There were no clinically significant changes in blood chemistry and hematology measurements, physical findings, vital signs, or ECG measurements.

Octreotide acetate was developed as a pharmacologically stable, long-acting analogue of the hormone somatostatin. Mimicking the actions of somatostatin, octreotide has been used for its antisecretory effects. Randomized control trials have established the efficacy of octreotide for malignant bowel obstruction and for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Octreotide has proven to be an effective agent for symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Newer uses include for bone marrow transplantation, infectious diarrheal syndromes, and management of hepatic metastases.

The patient presented to the emergency department with a few weeks' history of irritability, constipation and intermittent vomiting. His serum calcium was found to be 18 mg/dl. He was first treated with intravenous fluids, furosemide and glucocorticoids without significant improvement, but became eucalcemic within 24 hours after receiving a single dose of pamidronate. This case highlights the potential danger of high dose vitamin supplements in children, and the salutary effects of treatment with bisphosphonate.

### Ogilvie syndrome: a potentially life-threatening phenotype of immobilization hypercalcemia [^bf78f13f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Ogilvie syndrome, also known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is characterized by the clinical presentation and imaging evidence of acute colonic obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause. Several comorbidities and serious associated medical or surgical conditions have been described to be relevant to this syndrome. In general, a preferred initial management with favorable treatment outcomes is virtually to correct underlying disorders. Although disrupted electrolyte homeostasis may induce impaired colonic motility, hypercalcemia secondary to immobilization as a major culprit in this syndrome has rarely been studied. In this report, we profiled radiographic features, therapeutic strategies, and pathogenetic hypothesis of this clinical entity and highlighted the need for clinicians to maintain awareness of this distinct manifestation.

### Zoledronic acid: a new parenteral bisphosphonate [^8ed61faf]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhibition of bone resorption using bisphosphonates is an important step in palliation of complications of advanced cancer, such as hypercalcemia and metastatic bone disease.

Objective

The goal of this article was to describe the pharmacologic properties of zoledronic acid (zoledronate) and discuss findings from preclinical and clinical studies of its use in skeletal disorders.

Methods

Relevant English-language literature was identified using the terms zoledronic acid, zoledronate, Zometa, and 118072-93-8 through searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2003) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2003), and abstract proceedings from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997–2002).

Results

Zoledronic acid is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption. It is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or documented metastasis from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. The recommended dosage is 4 mg via IV over ≥ 15 minutes every 3 or 4 weeks. Compared with pamidronate 90 mg, zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg provided a higher complete response rate for hypercalcemia of malignancy by day 10 (88.4% and 86.7% vs 69.7%; P = 0.002 and P = 0.015) and longer duration of action (median time to relapse, 30 and 40 days vs 17 days; P = 0.001 and P = 0.007). In patients with breast cancer or multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid was as effective as pamidronate in delaying time to a first skeletal-related event (373 days vs 363 days). In patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases, zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the proportion of patients who experienced a skeletal-related event (33% vs 44% with placebo; P = 0.021) or a skeletal fracture (13% vs 22% with placebo; P = 0.015). In patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, zoledronic acid delayed the median time to a first skeletal-related event (230 days vs 163 days with placebo; P = 0.023). Common adverse events include fever, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and bone pain.

Conclusion

Zoledronic acid is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy and skeletal complications of metastatic bone disease.

Endocrinology was consulted for persistent hypercalcemia. Symptoms included diarrhea and increasing confusion over several weeks but no constipation or abdominal pain. There was no family history of hypercalcemia and no personal history of multiple myeloma, other malignancy, granulomatous disease, excess use of calcium or vitamin D or A supplements, lithium, or thiazide diuretics. On physical exam, vital signs were normal. He was fully oriented but was tangential during the interview and somnolent. His oral cavity showed poor dentition, 3 remaining teeth, and a large mass in the right buccal space. He had mild asterixis. His abdomen was nondistended and he had no lower extremity edema. The hypercalcemia was thought to be due to PTHrP production from the oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Given the increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw with planned tooth extractions the next day and upcoming radiation to the jaw region, cinacalcet was started at 30 mg orally twice a day on hospital day (HD) 13 in an effort to avoid intravenous zoledronic acid or denosumab. The following day (HD 14), the dose was increased to 60 mg orally twice a day. The patient's albumin-corrected serum calcium levels decreased from 13.2 mg/dL on the evening of HD 13 to 12.5 mg/dL on the evening of HD 14 after only 2 doses of 30 mg of cinacalcet. The fractional excretion of calcium increased from 3.7% prior to cinacalcet (HD 13) to 5.4% (HD 14). PTHrP declined to 4.6 pmol/L. PTH decreased to < 3 ng/L. Cinacalcet was increased to 60 mg twice a day on HD 15, and after two doses, his albumin-corrected calcium fell further to 11.6 with a PTHrP of 6.9 pmol/L. The fractional excretion of calcium increased to 7%.

### Severe hypercalcemia in a postpartum patient [^fb7eb1a2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are multiple clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia and several causes of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome is increasing in frequency.

Case Report

A 26-year-old woman presented after having undergone caesarian section. She complained of severe myalgias, arthralgias, an inability to ambulate, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and marked depression. Each of these symptoms has a broad differential diagnosis, but when considered together the theme "stones, bones, moans, and groans", seen in patients with hypercalcemia, is evident. This patient was found to have hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome related to the ingestion of calcium carbonate. Her symptoms and hypercalcemia resolved with treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of the many different symptoms of hypercalcemia. This case emphasizes the need for a careful medication history for any patient presenting with hypercalcemia, including over the counter medications. Physicians should have a high level of suspicion for milk-alkali syndrome in patients with hypercalcemia because milk-alkali syndrome is no longer a rare etiology but rather one of the most common causes of hypercalcemia.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^176c93e6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy — calcimimetic therapy details: Calcimimetics are described with an oral regimen of Initial: 30 mg twice daily; increase dose incrementally every 2 to 4 weeks (to 60 mg twice daily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 to 4 times daily) as necessary to normalize sCa levels. The mode of action is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist that reduces parathyroid hormone secretion and may decrease renal calcium reabsorption. Onset of effect occurs in 2 to 3 days, and during therapy calcium is reduced by at least 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) in approximately 60% of patients. Reported adverse events include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fractures, with case reports indicating reduction of calcium levels in patients with refractory HCM related to non–small-cell lung, neuroendocrine, breast, or renal cancer.

### Denosumab (Wyost) [^b36d6cb5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)

In Study 20062004 and Study 20040215, ONJ was confirmed in 6.6% of patients who received denosumab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture

Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with denosumab and was observed in 0.9% of patients in the pooled safety population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation

In the pooled safety population, 0.7% of patients experienced serious adverse events of hypercalcemia > 30 days following treatment discontinuation that was recurrent in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

Denosumab was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 20070315) in which 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [see Clinical Trials (14.4)].

The adverse reaction profile of denosumab in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, 20050103, 20062004, and 20040215. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients were nausea (30%), dyspnea (27%), decreased appetite (24%), headache (24%), peripheral edema (24%), vomiting (24%), anemia (21%), constipation (21%), and diarrhea (21%). The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on-study: fatigue (3%) and infection (6%). Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia (3%), hypokalemia (3%), and hypophosphatemia (76%) of patients. No deaths on-study were related to denosumab therapy.

### A case of thrombotic microangiopathy and acute sarcoidosis [^3a2ff400]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To establish a final diagnosis for this case, we must consider whether the patient's confirmed significant findings of granulomatous inflammation and TMA could be attributed to any other underlying condition. Both TMA and sarcoidosis can be associated with infection, but although hemolytic uremic syndrome is usually secondary to Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae, sarcoidosis has more frequently been linked to previous infection with Mycobacteria and Propionibacteria. Extensive screens for an infective agent were negative. In particular, the negative rectal swab for Shiga toxin argued against an infective cause, although we acknowledge that the sensitivity of this investigation was limited by the need to take a rectal swab (rather than stool sample) because the diarrhea had completely resolved. Similarly, although both sarcoidosis and TMA can be associated with autoimmune disease, our tests for relevant autoantibodies were uniformly negative. Furthermore, the autoimmune diseases most commonly associated with sarcoidosis (autoimmune thyroid disease, Sjögren's syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis) are distinct to those known to drive TMA (systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, scleroderma, and vasculitis). Finally, malignancy can drive both TMA and sarcoid-like reactions. However, no cancer has been detected on imaging, and tissue biopsies have been reassuring from this perspective. Sarcoid-like reactions can, in general, be difficult to distinguish from sarcoidosis, but without any known cancer or history of immunotherapy, it seems unlikely that this case is such a presentation.

Given the widespread features of acute sarcoidosis and the sequence of events, a plausible explanation is that sarcoidosis represents the primary underlying pathology of this patient's multiorgan dysfunction. We propose that sarcoidosis-driven hypercalcemia resulted in acute pancreatitis (reflected in the abdominal symptoms and raised amylase at presentation), which in turn led to TMA. Both sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia resulting in pancreatitis and this pathology leading to TMA are rare, but they have been described previously. Although two other cases of sarcoidosis and hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported previously, our case is unique in the severity of the presentation and the lack of any renal granulomata, which would indicate co-presentation rather than a causal link.

Collaborative input from a multidisciplinary team including hematologists, nephrologists, respiratory physicians, histopathologists, and thoracic radiologists was critical to managing this case. We would therefore advocate early specialist input in such unusual cases of multiorgan pathology to permit optimal treatment to be provided and good clinical outcomes achieved.

### Oncologic emergencies and urgencies: a comprehensive review [^f741d2c2]. CA (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with advanced cancer generate 4 million visits annually to emergency departments (EDs) and other dedicated, high-acuity oncology urgent care centers. Because of both the increasing complexity of systemic treatments overall and the higher rates of active therapy in the geriatric population, many patients experiencing acute decompensations are frail and acutely ill. This article comprehensively reviews the spectrum of oncologic emergencies and urgencies typically encountered in acute care settings. Presentation, underlying etiology, and up-to-date clinical pathways are discussed. Criteria for either a safe discharge to home or a transition of care to the inpatient oncology hospitalist team are emphasized. This review extends beyond familiar conditions such as febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, tumor lysis syndrome, malignant spinal cord compression, mechanical bowel obstruction, and breakthrough pain crises to include a broader spectrum of topics encompassing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, venous thromboembolism and malignant effusions, as well as chemotherapy-induced mucositis, cardiomyopathy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Emergent and urgent complications associated with targeted therapeutics, including small molecules, naked and drug-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, are summarized. Finally, strategies for facilitating same-day direct admission to hospice from the ED are discussed. This article not only can serve as a point-of-care reference for the ED physician but also can assist outpatient oncologists as well as inpatient hospitalists in coordinating care around the ED visit.

### Rapid fire: hypercalcemia [^d1247de0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Vitamin D insufficiency / deficiency in gastrointestinal disorders [^c2b0e607]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D and calcium are critical for skeletal health. Their absorption from the intestine is negatively impacted by a number of gastrointestinal diseases and surgical procedures, leading to osteoporosis and/or osteomalacia. Diseases of the liver can impact the metabolism of vitamin D to its circulating form, 25(OH)D, as well as the production of carrier proteins, albumin and vitamin D-binding protein, that may alter the delivery of 25(OH)D and its active metabolite 1,25(OH)₂D to target tissues, including the skeleton, again leading to bone disease. The clinician evaluating a patient with apparent osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency/ insufficiency needs to consider a gastrointestinal etiology. Similarly, the clinician evaluating a patient with a gastrointestinal disorder needs to evaluate that patient for vitamin D deficiency and bone disease. Treatment involves adequate vitamin D and calcium supplementation to achieve normal serum 25(OH)D, PTH, and serum and urine calcium levels.

### Vitamin D toxicity in a pediatric toxicological referral center; a cross-sectional study from iran [^425b2325]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A definite amount of vitamin D ingestion to cause toxicity has not been elucidated. Although maximum tolerable ingested dose is various in different age groups, maximum tolerable and safe dose of vitamin D is 1000 IU/day in infants younger than 6 months, 1500 IU/day in children older than 6 months, and 10000 IU/day in adults.

Vitamin D concentration is measured by 25- hydroxy vitamin D level because it has longer half-life compared to 1,25 OH vitamin D. Although there are different ranges of 25- OH vitamin D levels in several studies, the optimal level of 25-OH vitamin D is 30–100 ng/mL. Based on the normal range provided by the kit manufacturer, 25-OH vitamin D less than 10 ng/mL is deficient, while levels 11–30 ng/ml, 31–100, and over 100 ng/mL are insufficient, sufficient, and vitamin D toxicity, respectively. The most important laboratory findings in vitamin D toxicity are high levels of 25-OH vitamin D and hypercalcemia.

Patients with vitamin D toxicity may be asymptomatic or have signs or symptoms including nausea, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, irritation, headache, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, fever, and growth retardation. In fact, most of the patients' symptoms are compatible with high serum calcium level. Differences between symptoms and laboratory parameters in patients may be related to gastrointestinal absorption, vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin D storage, and diet. All of our patients were asymptomatic and it might be due to the maximum tolerable intake dose differences in various groups and high prevalence of vit D deficiency among Iranian children. Also further studies are needed to be performed in this regard.

Vitamin D deficiency is estimated to be approximately 35% in boys and 65% in girls in Iranian pediatric population. Frequency of vitamin D insufficiency is reported to be 31%. It shows that vitamin D deficiency is a critical health problem among Iranian children. Recently, the prevalence of vitamin D toxicity has increased because of more availability of its over-the-counter supplements.

### Drug-related hypercalcemia [^97fe2a1c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on the commonly prescribed medicaments that can be responsible for hypercalcemia, considering the prevalence, the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms, and the optimal medical management of each drug-induced hypercalcemia. Vitamin D supplements and 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D analogues increase intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium reabsorption as well as bone resorption. In patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving recombinant human PTH, transient hypercalcemia can occur because of overtreatment, usually during acute illness. Thiazide-induced hypercalcemia is mainly explained by enhanced renal proximal calcium reabsorption, changing preexistent asymptomatic normocalcemic or intermittently hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism into the classic hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism. Lithium causes hypercalcemia mainly by drug-induced hyperparathyroidism.

### Calcium acetate capsules 667 mg (calcium acetate) [^2dc32276]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Hypercalcemia is discussed elsewhere [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In clinical studies, calcium acetate has been generally well tolerated.

Calcium acetate was studied in a 3-month, open-label, non-randomized study of 98 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients and an alternate liquid formulation of calcium acetate was studied in a two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 69 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients. Adverse reactions (> 2% on treatment) from these trials are presented in Table 1.

Mild hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic or manifest itself as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. More severe hypercalcemia is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of calcium acetate-induced hypercalcemia. Isolated cases pruritus have been reported, which may represent allergic reactions.

6.2 Post marketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval of calcium acetate: dizziness, edema, and weakness.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The drug interaction of calcium acetate is characterized by the potential of calcium to bind to drugs with anionic functions (e.g., carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups). Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism.

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between calcium acetate or calcium acetate capsules and most concomitant drugs. When administering an oral medication with calcium acetate where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, administer the drug one hour before or three hours after calcium acetate capsules or calcium acetate. Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from the clinical trials with all forms of calcium acetate.

7.1 Ciprofloxacin

In a study of 15 healthy subjects, a co-administered single dose of 4 calcium acetate tablets, approximately 2.7g, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50%.

### Prognosis and phenotypes of advanced head and neck carcinoma associated with hypercalcemia [^18c54f35]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypercalcemia is the most common life‐threatening metabolic disorder observed in cancer patients, affecting approximately 10%–20% of individuals with advanced‐stage malignancies. While the incidence of hypercalcemia is relatively low at early stages of cancer (1%–5%), it increases significantly in patients with advanced disease, reaching rates of up to 30%–50%. Hypercalcemia in cancer patients mainly results from increased bone resorption, where calcium release from the bone exceeds the kidneys' excretory capacity. Four mechanisms are responsible: Local osteolysis, humoral hypercalcemia driven by parathyroid hormone‐related protein (PTH‐rP), hypercalcemia mediated by 1.25‐dihydroxyvitamin D, and ectopic hyperparathyroidism, though the latter two are rare. Local osteolysis occurs when malignant cells disrupt calcium regulation through osteoclastic bone resorption, further promoted by tumor cells interacting with bone cells and cytokine secretion. PTH‐rP secretion by tumors mimics parathyroid hormone action, increasing bone resorption and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. It presents a wide range of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia. However, more severe manifestations can occur, such as progressive mental impairment, renal failure, and, in extreme cases, coma or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest. The management of hypercalcemia typically involves aggressive rehydration and the administration of bone resorption inhibitors, primarily bisphosphonates.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer globally and ranks as the seventh leading cause of cancer‐related mortality. Hypercalcemia is a well‐recognized complication in HNSCC, with reported incidences ranging from 3% to 50%. Hypercalcemia in patients with HNSCC is often associated with poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2–6 months following diagnosis. Despite its frequency, the characteristics and clinical outcomes of hypercalcemic patients with HNSCC remain poorly described, and there is a need to investigate strategies to improve both life expectancy and management of hypercalcemia‐related complications in this patient population.

This study aims to evaluate the prognostic impact of hypercalcemia at diagnosis in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Additionally, we seek to explore the clinical characteristics, underlying etiologies, and treatment approaches associated with this condition.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^f9c8af21]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are insulinomas associated with hypoglycemia with symptoms of confusion, diaphoresis, syncope and even hastened death from stroke or MI. Although rarer, other functional PNETs can have profound symptoms, such as gastrinomas (associated with Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome (ZES) with multiple peptic ulcers, diarrhea, heartburn, weight loss); somatostatinomas (associated with diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, diarrhea/steatorrhea); glucagonomas (associated with weight loss, skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema), glucose intolerance/diabetes); VIPomas (associated with profound watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, abdominal pain). The symptoms from these functional tumors can severely limit patient functional status and can be difficult for palliative care treatment and at the end of life for caregivers and patients to maintain hygiene and prevent infection. Furthermore, NETs of any kind (GI, pancreatic, lung, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) also can make ectopic hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, leading to Cushing's Syndrome with associated severe hypertension, abnormal weight gain, hyperglycemia, hypercoagulability, or parathyroid hormone-related peptide leading to severe hypercalcemia. All these various functional NETs diminish the quality of life and require treatment in the palliative care setting, as well as end of life, depending on the severity. For example, SSAs and other medications for profound diarrhea may be necessary even at the end of life for those with several functional PNETs. In patients with symptoms related to ZES, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole) may be needed for patient comfort. Management of severe hypoglycemia related to insulinoma at end of life, besides SSAs, glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone, boluses of IV D50W or glucagon IV or IM may be given. Furthermore, diazoxide is used to manage hypoglycemia by inhibiting insulin secretion; however, it can cause significant edema and it may require the use of loop diuretics.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^d0435862]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Another approach is to target the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcimimetics, allosteric modulators of the CaSR, directly reduce parathyroid cell hormone secretion by binding to sites that increase the receptors' affinity for calcium. Thus, sensitivity to extracellular calcium is enhanced. A first-generation calcimimetic, R-568, was used for 2 yr in a patient with metastatic parathyroid cancer with controlled hypercalcemia. R-568 has been replaced by cinacalcet, a more potent second-generation agent with a longer half-life and more predictable hepatic metabolism. In benign PHPT, cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium and partially reduces PTH concentrations for up to 3 yr.

Recently, the results of a multicenter study of cinacalcet in 29 patients with inoperable parathyroid carcinoma were published. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients experiencing a ≥ 1-mg/dl reduction in serum calcium from baseline at the end of the titration phase. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in serum calcium, plasma PTH, bone turnover markers, and health-related quality of life variables. The dose of cinacalcet in this study was titrated from 30 mg twice daily (a dose that might be effective in benign PHPT) up to 90 mg four times daily as required to lower serum calcium levels. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 1051 days (mean, 328 ± 306 days). Cinacalcet effectively reduced hypercalcemia in about two thirds of patients with inoperable parathyroid carcinoma (Fig. 3). In the responders (18 of 29 patients), serum calcium levels declined from 15.0 ± 0.5 to 11.2 ± 0.3 mg/dl (p < 0.001), with the greatest responses seen in those patients with the highest levels of serum calcium at study entry. It was of interest that the marked reductions in serum calcium were not accompanied by a similar fall in circulating PTH. PTH levels reached a nadir 4 h after drug administration, but the decline was not pronounced, nor was it sustained. Although hypotheses abound, the reason for the discrepancy in calcium and PTH response to cinacalcet remains unclear at this time. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. Reported in more than one half of all patients receiving cinacalcet at these doses, these symptoms necessitated discontinuation of drug in some cases. Serious adverse events, including fracture and death, were not considered to be drug related. Instead, they were expected consequences of the patients' longstanding, often widely metastatic, underlying disease. There are no data suggesting that cinacalcet alters the course of the parathyroid cancer itself. Therefore, this agent should not be introduced to control hypercalcemia in a patient with a metastatic lesion that is accessible and amenable to surgical extirpation. However, the data do suggest that cinacalcet is useful in reducing calcium levels, and is tolerated in many patients at cumulative doses up to 360 mg/d. Furthermore, unlike other options for treatment of hypercalcemia, this agent can be used in patients with the renal impairment so common in patients with longstanding parathyroid cancer. Cinacalcet therefore represents an important new option for management of intractable hypercalcemia in patients with inoperable disease.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^4b2a56d8]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic vitamin D intoxication (causing hypercalcaemia and renal calcifications) is very rare and has in most instances only been reported in people with s-25(OH)D levels above 4–500 nmol/L. An increased risk of adverse events, however, appears to be related to levels of s-25(OH)D levels > 200 nmol/L. Accordingly, based on our current knowledge, it seems reasonable to aim at targeting s-25(OH)D levels in the range of 75–125 nmol/L.

From a pharmacokinetic point of view, daily and weekly oral dosing as well as providing vitamin D as a large oral or intramuscular bolus dose (months apart) has been shown to be effective in maintaining s-25(OH)D at a replete level. However, although intramuscular bolus injections tend to reach the same level as an equal total oral dose, the increase in s-25(OH)D levels occur with a month of delay following injection therapy. Furthermore, providing vitamin D as a large oral or intramuscular bolus dose has been shown to increase risk of falls and fractures in RCTs. As a consequence, the US Preventive Services Task Force as well as others have recently called for caution on use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation. Providing vitamin D supplementation as a daily dose is therefore the preferred option.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^487c4432]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis of Hypophosphatemia

While hypophosphatemia may occur in settings where calcium-related abnormalities are the primary feature, such as severe vitamin D deficiency, genetic primary vitamin D metabolism defects, or primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, in this article we focus on conditions with hypophosphatemia as a primary manifestation and mechanism. Hypophosphatemia occurs by 3 mechanisms: transcellular shifts, impaired gastrointestinal intake or absorption, or renal losses. Chronic hypophosphatemia from gastrointestinal or renal mechanisms causes rickets. Figure 1 illustrates the differential diagnosis of chronic hypophosphatemia.

Figure 1.
Algorithm for assessing causes of hypophosphatemic rickets. Note that before applying this algorithm, the calciopenic causes of rickets (such as vitamin D deficiency, etc. must first be excluded). The calciopenic forms are often marked by hypocalcemia along with marked elevation of PTH. Once calciopenic forms are excluded, evaluation for causes of hypophosphatemia is pursued beginning with TmP/GFR. a Consider genetic causes even without family history. b Iron deficiency itself triggers hypophosphatemia in ADHR. c Iron infusions especially iron carboxymaltose or polymaltose can also trigger hypophosphatemia, likely through impaired cleavage of FGF23. d FGF23 may be high in hyperparathyroidism. e Hypercalciuria may not always be present in tubulopathies. f Non-FGF23–mediated causes of hypophosphatemia may still result in high FGF23 concentrations if moderate to severe chronic kidney disease develops.

Assessments

Safety was monitored from first study drug dose until 30 days after the last dose (or initiation of another anticancer therapy). Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. A DLT was defined as one or more of the following drug-related toxicities occurring during cycle 1: grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding diarrhea/nausea/vomiting); grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or nausea/vomiting lasting > 48 h; grade 4 neutropenia or thrombo-cytopenia, febrile neutropenia, hyperphosphatemia (defined as serum phosphorus of > 7 mg/dl for > 7 days, > 9 mg/dl for 14 days despite phosphorus-lowering therapies, or > 10 mg/dl), creatinine increase (> 1.5 × ULN for 7 days); grade 2 hypercalcemia for > 7 days; ectopic de novo calcification in soft tissues; or any grade > 2 treatment-related AE preventing completion of cycle 1 or initiation of cycle 2 (beyond a 21-day delay). Serum phosphorus was assessed at screening, on day 1 (predose), and on days 8 and 15 of cycles 1 and 2. Serum phosphorus continued to be monitored on day 8 of each subsequent cycle, if clinically indicated or if previous assessments showed serum phosphorus elevations. Hyperphosphatemia was managed with dose modifications, phosphate binders, and diet modifications. Dose-reduction and discontinuation criteria are detailed in supplementary Methods, available at Annals of Oncology online.

Tumor assessments were performed up to 28 days prior to cycle 1 initiation, at the end of cycles 2 and 4, and every 3 cycles thereafter. Tumor response was assessed according to RECIST v1.1.

Blood samples for PK and PD measurements were collected on day 1 and the last Wednesday of cycle 1 of the t.i.w. dosing schedule and on days 1 and 21 of the q.d. dosing schedule at the following time points: 0 h (predose) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postdose on both schedules, as well as at 48 h on the t.i.w. schedule.

For PK assessments, futibatinib was measured in plasma and urine by validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (supplementary Methods, available at Annals of Oncology online). Serum phosphorus and FGF23 were assessed as PD markers.

### Vitamin D intoxication in two brothers: be careful with dietary supplements [^7dc12c27]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (VitD) intoxication, a well-known cause of hypercalcaemia in children, has renal, cardiac and neurological consequences. Iatrogenic or accidental administrations are the most common causes. We present two cases of hypervitaminosis D due to over-the-counter VitD supplement self-medication. A 12-year-old boy was hospitalised for abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting. Routine biochemistry indicated severe hypercalcaemia and renal failure. Plasma 25-OH VitD level was very high and parathyroid hormone was suppressed. Renal ultrasound showed nephrolithiasis. Hydration, diuretics and prednisone induced a progressive reduction of calcium levels. His brother, who was receiving the same treatment, was hospitalised although asymptomatic. Normal serum calcium and renal function were revealed, while 25-OH VitD was high and parathyroid hormone was suppressed. Renal ultrasound was within the normal range. Examination of the VitD content of the over-the-counter supplement revealed a higher amount than declared. VitD administration implies several risks and must be prescribed only when needed and under strict medical control.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^c4a69be2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The most effective therapy for patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy is treatment of the underlying cancer in order to reduce tumour production of factors that promote bone resorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption; however, this may not be possible or effective in patients with advanced cancer. Therapies that inhibit bone resorption and promote renal calcium excretion therefore become important. Most patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy are dehydrated at presentation and rehydration is often the first step of treatment. Saline should be given at a maximal initial rate of 200–300 mL/h, then adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h. This, however, relieves the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying disease, and therefore, rehydration alone rarely resolves hypercalcaemia. Nearly all patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy have increased osteoclastic bone resorption; hence, inhibition of bone resorption is a key target for management of the condition.

### Blue diaper syndrome andMutations [^bdf232b7]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Blue diaper syndrome (BDS) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 211000) is an extremely rare disorder that was first described in 1964. The characteristic finding is a bluish discoloration of urine spots in the diapers of affected infants. Additional clinical features of the first described patients included diarrhea, inadequate weight gain, hypercalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis. An intestinal defect of tryptophan absorption was postulated as the underlying pathology. However, functional evidence for this theory is lacking. No genetic cause has been identified so far. Here, we report on a boy who presented with neonatal-onset diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, transient hepatopathy, recurrent hypoglycemia, and blue-stained urine spots in his diapers. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of urine samples at different time points demonstrated the constant presence of indigo derivatives, thereby confirming the diagnosis of BDS. Of note, the visibility of indigo derivatives in the urine was highly dependent on the urine's pH. To identify the underlying genetic cause of the disease, whole-exome sequencing was performed, leading to the identification of a homozygous frameshift mutation in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1; NM_000439.4: c.679del, p [Val227Leufs*12]). PCSK1 encodes prohormone convertase 1/3, and mutations within this gene have been reported as a rare cause of early-onset malabsorptive diarrhea and multiple endocrine dysfunction. In our report, we suggest that BDS can be caused by PCSK1 mutations.

### Pamidronate disodium [^9b38afdb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary calcium/creatinine and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios decrease and usually return to within or below normal after treatment with pamidronate disodium. These changes occur within the first week after treatment, as do decreases in serum calcium levels, and are consistent with an antiresorptive pharmacologic action.

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in metastatic bone disease and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Correction of excessive bone resorption and adequate fluid administration to correct volume deficits are therefore essential to the management of hypercalcemia.

Most cases of hypercalcemia associated with malignancy occur in patients who have breast cancer; squamous-cell tumors of the lung or head and neck; renal-cell carcinoma; and certain hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and some types of lymphomas. A few less-common malignancies, including vasoactive intestinal-peptide-producing tumors and cholangiocarcinoma, have a high incidence of hypercalcemia as a metabolic complication. Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups, according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved.

Figure 3.
Comparison of cancer and treatment-specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs). (A) The aggregated frequency of 3 anti-CTLA4 specific irAEs (colitis, diarrhea, and hypophysis) in pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab monotherapy and combination therapy. (B, C) The bar graphs represent the aggregated incident of colitis, diarrhea, and hypophysis across all the cancer types shown in panel A. The numbers on the bar graph indicate the number of participants with the reported irAEs over the total number of participants administered the ICI agent. (D) The reporting odds ratio (ROR) of the top severe adverse events in melanoma and lung cancer participants treated with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab monotherapy.

Having established that our database was able to generate data consistent with published observations, we calculated proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) to assess the statistical incidence of the reported "secondary-level adverse event terms" as reported by ClinicalTrial.gov (Supplementary Methods). Overall, there was a high degree of correlation between these 2 measures, indicating the robustness of our dataset (Supplementary Fig. S5). To identify other potential cancer- or treatment-specific irAEs, we compared the ROR of the 2 most recorded cancer types (melanoma and lung cancer) treated with single-agent pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or ipilimumab. Due to the small number of patients with lung cancer administered ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 24), the ROR results were not presented. Overall, we identified 6 adverse events with the highest ROR values. The 3 adverse events considered more frequent in melanoma than in lung cancer were colitis, hyponatremia, and pericardial effusion (Fig. 3D). The incidence of colitis in patients with melanoma is associated with ipilimumab treatment, whereas hyponatremia and pericardial effusion are associated with pembrolizumab treatment. In contrast, the ROR values for pneumonitis, hypercalcemia, and deep vein thrombosis were the highest in lung cancer (Fig. 3D). Pneumonitis is associated with pembrolizumab, whereas hypercalcemia and deep vein thrombosis are more associated with nivolumab than with pembrolizumab in patients with lung cancer.

### Bones, stones, moans and groans: hypercalcaemia revisited [^ed19392f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Disorders of calcium homeostasis are uncommon but important because of the broad spectrum of potential underlying causes that lie on a spectrum from the benign to the life-threatening. Paediatricians may find them challenging because they do not arise often enough for the investigative approach to be second nature. We report a 4-year-old with acute onset profound hypercalcaemia. We focus on an approach to the clinical problem that is based on the potential organ systems affected, namely the gut, bone and kidney. Key biochemical parameters that may help the paediatric team to reach a diagnosis are discussed, as well as important components of acute management.

### Calcium vitamin D3 supplementation in clinical practice: side effect and satisfaction [^5744ad9f]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is little debate about calcium needs during lifespan for optimizing health in health of bone and out of bone. Many people are avoid or limit dairy products because of lactase intolerant, then they have no choice but to eat supplement. Calcium supplements cause few, if any, side effects, unfortunately. Side effects can sometimes occur, including gas, constipation, bloating, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite, mental/mood changes, and bone/muscle pain. Vitamin D3 is used to facilitate absorption of the calcium in the gut, and to facilitate calcium incorporation in the bones. Low vitamin D levels are associated with impairment of the active absorption of calcium. Fortified Vitamin D3 with calcium without gastrointestinal side effect is a greatest effective factor to prevent bone loss. OsteoCalVitFort seems more potent form of other Vitamin D and Calcium supplement (500 mg calcium and 400 I.U of vitamin D3). The aim of this study was to evaluate side effects and satisfaction level of OsteoCalVitFort among people who consumed calcium supplement.

### Vitamin D toxicity resulting from overzealous correction of vitamin D deficiency [^0e3e1dac]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D toxicity, often considered rare, can be life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity, if not identified promptly.

Objective

To describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors and management of patients with vitamin D toxicity seen between January 2011 and January 2013.

Methodology

Patients presenting with vitamin D toxicity, between January 2011 and January 2013, at single tertiary care centre in Delhi-NCR, India, were included. Evaluation included detailed clinical history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).

Results

Sixteen patients with vitamin D toxicity could be identified. Clinical manifestations included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64.5 (42–86) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) serum total serum calcium level were 371 (175–1161) ng/ml and 13.0 (11.1–15.7) mg/dl, respectively. Overdose of vitamin D caused by prescription of mega-doses of vitamin D was the cause of vitamin D toxicity in all cases. Median (range) cumulative vitamin D dose was 3,600,000 (2,220,000–6,360,000) IU.

Conclusion

Our data demonstrate an emergence of vitamin D toxicity as an increasingly common cause of symptomatic hypercalcaemia. Irrational use of vitamin D in mega-doses resulted in vitamin D toxicity in all cases. Awareness among healthcare providers regarding the toxic potential of high doses of vitamin D and cautious use of vitamin D supplements is the key to prevent this condition.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms [^919fffd3]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

VIPoma

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a 28 amino acid peptide and a ligand to a specific G protein–coupled receptor. It has a multitude of actions on many tissues, organ systems, and functions including neuronal, digestive, cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive, exocrine, endocrine, neuroendocrine, immune, and renal functions.

VIPomas are NENs which secrete VIP. Their annual incidence is 1 to 2 per 10 million population. These tumors can be localized in the pancreas (75%), or in the sympathetic ganglia (25%). The first cases of VIPoma were reported in 1958 by John V. Verner Jr. and Ashton B. Morrison. VIPoma syndrome has also been named Verner–Morrison syndrome.

VIPoma patients suffer from profuse large volumes of watery (secretory) diarrhea. This will eventually lead to severe electrolyte disturbances, such as loss of bicarbonate and potassium in the stools. Other symptoms include facial flushing and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. VIPoma syndrome has been termed watery diarrhea hypokalemia achlorhydria syndrome. About 50% of patients also present with hypercalcemia. The mechanism of action for this effect is unknown, but it might be related to cosecretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide.

Glucagonoma

Glucagon is a 29 amino acid peptide and a ligand to a specific G protein–coupled receptor. It is the most important catabolic hormone of the body causing a rise of the concentrations of glucose and fatty acids. Glucagonomas are PanNENs which secrete glucagon.

In the majority of glucagonoma patients, there is either a new onset or worsening of diabetes mellitus. The catabolic effect of glucagon leads to significant weight loss in 70% to 80% of patients. Also, cheilosis, glossitis, and stomatitis is reported in 30% to 40% of patients. Thromboembolic events and anemia frequently occur in these patients. But the most distinct feature of glucagonomas remains a typical skin manifestation named necrolytic migratory erythema (Fig. 2B, C).

### Pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation [^de0564c2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood marker screening

Blood testing encompasses a range of key parameters, among which thyroid function, blood glucose, and serum calcium are particularly pertinent to STC diagnosis. Thyroid hormones exert broad regulatory effects on metabolism; in hypothyroidism, insufficient thyroxine secretion leads to glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the submucosa or smooth muscle of the intestine, reduced cellular metabolism, impaired smooth muscle contractility, and diminished peristalsis, culminating in STC. Measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) enables accurate assessment of thyroid status; elevated TSH and reduced FT4 are indicative of hypothyroidism, providing a robust etiological basis for STC.

The association between glycemic abnormalities and STC is also significant. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus precipitates a spectrum of metabolic derangements, including neuropathy and microangiopathy. Hyperglycemia induces neural degeneration and demyelination, impairing autonomic regulation of the gut, while microvascular disease results in mucosal ischemia and hypoxia, compromising enteric cellular function and motility. Studies indicate that approximately 31.2% of diabetic patients experience constipation. Assessment of fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) facilitates identification of latent diabetes risk and timely intervention to alleviate STC symptoms.

Fluctuations in serum calcium also exert significant effects on intestinal function. Calcium influences gastrointestinal health by enhancing peristalsis, softening stool, regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, and modulating inflammatory processes. Hypercalcemia, as seen in hyperparathyroidism, reduces neuromuscular excitability and impairs smooth muscle contractility, leading to constipation. Conversely, hypocalcemia increases smooth muscle excitability, but insufficient calcium impairs excitation–contraction coupling, also resulting in dysmotility. Measurement of serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) assists in excluding calcium-phosphorus metabolic disorders as confounding or causative factors in STC.

Significance of stool testing

Stool analysis holds unique value in STC diagnosis. Fecal microbiota profiling reflects the intestinal microecological environment, inflammatory status, and potential organic pathology. The gut microbiota, as the "invisible guardian" of intestinal health, is closely linked to the pathogenesis and progression of STC. In STC patients, dysbiosis — characterized by reduced beneficial and increased pathogenic bacteria — disrupts normal metabolism, immune modulation, and neural signaling, thereby impairing colonic motility. Comprehensive analysis of microbial abundance, composition, and metabolic byproducts provides insight into the intestinal microecology, guiding targeted probiotic supplementation and microbiota modulation.

In summary, laboratory diagnostic markers are intimately associated with STC diagnosis, providing complementary and corroborative information from multiple perspectives to facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform subsequent therapeutic strategies.

### A case report: giant cystic parathyroid adenoma presenting with parathyroid crisis after vitamin D replacement [^0284ccbb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights the rare presentation of parathyroid cystic adenoma extending into the mediastinum presenting with parathyroid crisis and with very high serum calcium and Intact PTH levels. In addition, the size of the cystic adenoma was huge. The clinical and biochemical presentation mimicked that of parathyroid carcinoma. This case also illustrates the unmasking of primary hyperparathyroidism after Vitamin D replacement in Vitamin D deficient patients. The consistent hypokalemia seen in this patient together with hypercalcemia needs further research.

Parathyroid crisis is a life-threatening emergency. It is also known in literature as acute hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid storm, parathyrotoxicosis, acute parathyroid intoxication, parathormone intoxication, hypercalcemic crisis and calcium intoxication. It was first described in 1923 by Dawson and Struthers. It is characterized by severe hypercalcemia (> 14 mg/dL or > 3.5 mmol/L) associated with signs and symptoms of multi-organ failure. Although most cases of severe hypercalcemia are seen in malignancy, it is important to emphasize that severe hypercalcemia with raised PTH is pathognomonic of primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with parathyroid crisis demonstrate gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, renal failure and cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Our patient had very high corrected serum calcium level of 23.0 mg/dL. She exhibited gastrointestinal features like nausea, vomiting and constipation.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^3ace3603]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within 4 h of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be given at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 h; duration of dosing is, however, limited to 48 h owing to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy is rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. In addition, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease of high serum calcium levels.

In the dose escalation phase of Module 1A, the severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) increased with dose (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). In Module 1A, discontinuations were most frequent in the highest (non-tolerated) dose cohort of 480 mg OD. At the monotherapy doses considered clinically active (240 mg OD and 360 mg OD), only 4% (1/24) discontinued treatment due to a related AE (nausea). In Module 1B-1, 1/23 (4.3%) discontinued samuraciclib due to 2 related AEs of diarrhea and recurrent nausea (both Grade 1). In combination with fulvestrant, 7/31 patients (23%) across both dose levels discontinued due to related gastrointestinal AEs (all Grade 2 or 3) and 5 discontinued due to unrelated AEs (1 each of COVID infection [Grade 4], brain metastases [Grade 3], diaphragmatic hernia [Grade 3], anxiety [Grade 3] and hypercalcemia from bone metastases [Grade 2]). The discontinuations were similar in the 2 dose groups.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The suspicion of pHPT is typically raised by the detection of hypercalcemia and/or its associated symptoms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration is elevated, or within normal limits but inappropriate considering the presence of hypercalcemia. A rare type of pHPT is normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism presenting with normal serum calcium levels but an elevated PTH concentration.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease, affecting women 2–3 times more often than men. It is caused by the hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands, which are overproducing PTH. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are solitary adenomas in the majority of cases. Approximately 15–20% of cases are caused by multiglandular disease (MGD), i.e. multiple adenomas or hyperplasia, while parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of cases. The majority of pHPT cases (95%) occur sporadically, but approximately 5% are part of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2, and 4 (MEN-1, MEN-2, and MEN-4) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, or as part of non-syndromic familial pHPT.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a potential differential diagnosis to pHPT, has to be recognized as it usually does not require surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by increased serum PTH levels due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, triggered by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or decreased serum vitamin D concentration. The most common causes of sHPT are vitamin D deficiency and chronic renal disease. Sometimes pHPT and vitamin D deficiency occur simultaneously, which results in decreased or normal serum calcium levels. Rarer causes are long-term treatment with lithium or magnesium, intestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, or sunitinib treatment.

The therapy of sHPT depends on the primary cause. In the case of renal HPT, therapy mainly consists of a restriction of dietary intake together with medical treatment with calcimimetics, vitamin D analogues, and phosphorus binders. Still, parathyroidectomy is required in patients with renal sHPT refractory to medical treatment, i.e. in approximately 15% of patients after 10 years and 38% of patients after 20 years of renal dialysis therapy.

4 DISCUSSION

Our findings demonstrated a significant decrease in serum calcium levels with hydration and bisphosphonates. Meanwhile, a significant increase in serum calcium levels was observed after the use of furosemide and was significantly and positively correlated with the increase in serum creatinine level.

Hypercalcaemia may result from three possible mechanisms: increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption, stimulation of osteoclast‐mediated bone resorption, and increased renal synthesis of 1.25(OH)₂D₃, which in turn promotes enhanced intestinal calcium absorption. Primary hyperparathyroidism represents one of the most frequent causes of hypercalcaemia. Severe hypercalcaemia defined by a total calcaemia greater than 3.5 mmol/L (14 mg/dl) or greater than 3 mmol/L (12 mg/dl) with signs of poor tolerance, is a life‐threatening condition.

Dehydration is a constant complication of severe hypercalcaemia. It results from polyuria and digestive disorders. It may contribute to the increase in the serum calcium level by reducing calcium clearance. Therefore, the cornerstone of initial management of severe hypercalcaemia consists of restoring extracellular volume with 0.9% normal saline solution. The objective of this measure is to restore blood volume and to re‐establish normal renal function in case of acute renal failure. Several mechanisms can explain the decrease in the calcaemia level with intravenous saline load: the release of hemoconcentration, the enhancement of calcium excretion by increasing glomerular filtration, and the calciuretic effect of sodium chloride leading to the decrease in the tubular reabsorption of calcium. The rate of fluid to infuse is based on the degree of hypercalcaemia, the severity of dehydration, the patient's age, and the associated comorbidities, in particular cardiac and renal failure. An initial flow of 200 to 300 ml/h is needed and subsequently adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100 to 150 ml/h. The recommended regimen is to administer 4–6 litres of isotonic saline daily in patients without heart or renal failure. Strict monitoring is indicated during saline hydration because of the risk of fluid overload and hypokalaemia.

### Multiple myeloma presenting as acute pancreatitis [^e4954892]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A 36 year old male presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting without hematemesis, diarrhea and anorexia. He presented with respiratory distress, shock and fever at the emergency. He was intubated and shifted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis with hypercalcemia and an elevated amylase and lipase's well as thrombocytopenia and elevated creatinine. CT scan of abdomen was done which showed lytic bone lesions in the spine and necrosis of the pancrease. He was evaluated for multiple myeloma and it was confirmed in a bone marrow biopsy. Multiple myeloma usually is seen in patients aged more than 60 yrs. The typical presentation of multiple myeloma is anemia, back pain, and an elevated sedimentation rate. Patients with multiple myeloma have hypercalcemia but it's rarely manifested as acute pancreatitis. This case shows a rare presentation of multiple myeloma as acute pancreatitis in a younger adult.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^92320508]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Pathogenesis of diarrhea in the adult: diagnostic challenges and life-threatening conditions [^c6488947]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms that regulate ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract are complex. Disturbance of this homeostatic state by bile acids, bacterial enterotoxins and neoplasm-derived secretagogues, for example, can lead to diarrhea. Determining the causes of chronic diarrhea in individual patients may, therefore, represent a diagnostic challenge. The gastrointestinal tract has finely tuned mechanisms to maintain ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion. To achieve this homeostasis, various ionic transport proteins/complexes are targeted to the apical, basal or basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. Na, K and Cl ion transport proteins are regulated by endogenous activators (e.g. cAMP, PGE2, Ca), dietary-related factors (e.g. bile acids) and through post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). In certain pathophysiologic states, this homeostatic ionic/fluid exchange becomes dysfunctional as a result of failure of compensatory pro-absorptive/anti-secretory mechanisms. The excessive secretion of Na and Cl ions followed by the release of a large amount of H2O into the colonic lumen results in diarrhea, which may be acute or chronic, and can be life-threatening if not ameliorated. Diverse infectious organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, viruses) utilize different mechanisms to cause intestinal disease and diarrhea. These pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations in ion transport, disruption of tight junctions and elicitation of inflammatory responses. Studies of patients infected with certain pathogens, those with ulcerative colitis and those harboring extra-colonic or colonic neoplasms have elucidated some of these pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea. Determining the etiology of chronic diarrhea in specific cases may be a diagnostic challenge for both gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.

### Vatalanib for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) resistant to imatinib: final results of a phase II study [^64be6f0c]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The median TTP was 4.5 months (95% CI, 2.9–8.4 months). The median TTP was 5.8 months (95% CI, 2.9–9.5 months) in the subset of patients who had not received prior sunitinib and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.1–6.0 months) among those exposed to prior imatinib and sunitinib (P = 0.992; Figure 2).

Vatalanib 1250 mg per day was generally well tolerated, and no permanent dose reductions were required. The dose was temporarily reduced in 39 (87%) out of the 45 patients for 1 to 64 days as per protocol due to an adverse event or laboratory test abnormality (n = 4). After the reductions, the dose was returned back to 1250 mg per day.

Adverse events reported for ⩾2 patients, regardless of the CTC grade, are presented in Table 2. The most frequently reported adverse events were hypertension (n = 13, 28.9%), nausea (n = 13, 28.9%), dizziness (n = 11, 24.4%), proteinuria (n = 9, 20.0%), abdominal pain (n = 8, 17.8%) and diarrhea (n = 8, 17.8%). Most adverse events were mild (grade 1 or 2); only 23 severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse events were recorded during the study. Of these, four were grade 4 in severity (hypercalcemia, pain, pulmonary embolism, sudden death; n = 1 for each), of which only pulmonary embolism was possibly related to study medication. Only one patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and none with hand–foot skin reaction.

### Hypercalcemic crisis due to adult T cell leukemia: a rare cause of paralytic ileus [^4282799f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Adult T cell leukemia- lymphoma is a rare aggressive malignancy of the peripheral T lymphocytes, caused by human T cell lymphotropic virus -1 (HTLV-1) infection. Hypercalcemia occurs in about 70% of patients with acute adult T cell leukemia. However, there are very few case reports of adult T cell leukemia presenting as a hypercalcemic crisis. We report a case of a 54-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, constipation and altered sensorium. On examination he had generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and paralytic ileus. Investigation revealed hypercalcemic crisis with low parathormone (PTH) levels. Peripheral smear and bone marrow aspirate were consistent with adult T cell leukemia. HTLV-1 serology was positive. Despite the corrective measures for hypercalcemia and chemotherapy, he succumbed to the illness in a week.

### Cancer-associated hypercalcemia | NEJM resident 360… [^cef5a972]. resident360.nejm.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Q: What is the first goal of therapy for patients with cancer-associated hypercalcemia. A: Hypercalcemia is associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These factors often produce extreme dehydration and lead to a reduced glomerular filtration rate, which limits the ability of the kidney to excrete calcium. Thus, the first goal of therapy is to correct volume depletion. Sodium delivery to the distal tubule promotes urinary calcium excretion and increases calcium clearance by the kidneys. Therefore, it has become common practice to add loop diuretics, such as furosemide, after rehydration has been achieved. However, no controlled studies have been conducted to determine whether the addition of loop diuretics lowers calcium levels more rapidly than hydration alone, and the authors of a critical review of nine case series concluded that the routine use of loop diuretics in the treatment of cancer-associated hypercalcemia was not helpful.

If used, diuretics should be administered only after volume status has been fully restored or during the care of patients with hypercalcemia who are at high risk for the development of fluid overload after aggressive fluid resuscitation. A: In most instances, cancer-associated hypercalcemia occurs as a result of excessive bone resorption. Therefore, the mainstay of therapy is the administration of powerful antiresorptive agents — primarily bisphosphonates or denosumab — and, in some instances, calcitonin. Calcitonin is a peptide hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland that inhibits osteoclast activity and promotes renal calcium excretion. When administered, calcitonin lowers serum calcium levels rapidly, within 12 to 24 hours. However, the reductions are small, and the effects are lost within 48 to 96 hours owing to the down-regulation of calcitonin receptors.

Calcitonin is primarily useful in the initial lowering of very high calcium levels while waiting for the more prolonged onset of action of other antiresorptive agents. Both bisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with rare adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. Most cases of cancer-associated hypercalcemia are life-threatening, and the benefits of treatment far outweigh these small risks.
