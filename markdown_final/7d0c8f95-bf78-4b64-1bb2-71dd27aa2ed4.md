## Question

Problem 2. At an open evening at the conservatory, four quartets, five duets, and six trios were supposed to perform (a quartet consists of four musicians, a trio of three, and a duet of two; each musician is a member of only one musical group). However, one quartet and two duets unexpectedly went on tour, and a soloist from one of the trios fell ill, so the members of this trio had to perform as a duo. How many musicians performed at the conservatory that evening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many musicians performed at the conservatory that evening, given the original lineup and the last-minute changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial total number of musicians. Then, I should verify which groups actually performed versus those that did not. Next, I will calculate the musicians from the performing groups, including the modified trio that became a duo. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the initial setup: four quartets, five duets, and six trios, with each musician in only one group. So the planned total is 4 × 4 + 5 × 2 + 6 × 3 = 16 + 10 + 18 = 44 musicians, but wait, I should verify that I'm not overcounting anyone; the constraint that each musician belongs to only one group means this additive approach is correct for the planned roster.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who actually performed. I need to check the cancellations and changes: one quartet and two duets went on tour, so they did not perform, and one trio had a soloist fall ill, so that trio performed as a duo instead of a trio. That means the performing groups are three quartets, three duets, five unchanged trios, and one modified trio performing as a duo.

> I will now examine the contribution from quartets and duets that did perform: three quartets contribute 3 × 4 = 12 musicians, and three duets contribute 3 × 2 = 6 musicians, so together that's 12 + 6 = 18 musicians so far.

> Next, I should review the trio situation carefully. Five trios performed unchanged, so they contribute 5 × 3 = 15 musicians. The sixth trio performed as a duo, so it contributes 2 musicians, not 3. Wait, let me verify I'm not mistakenly subtracting a person twice; the net effect is simply that this group now has 2 performers rather than 3, so the total from trios is 15 + 2 = 17 musicians.

> Let me double-check the final addition: 18 musicians from quartets and duets plus 17 musicians from trios equals 35 musicians total who performed that evening. I should confirm the subtraction from the original 44: 44 − 4 (the absent quartet) − 4 (the two absent duets) − 1 (the missing soloist in the trio) = 35, which matches, so the arithmetic checks out.

> Final answer: 35 musicians performed at the conservatory that evening.

---

The total number of musicians who performed is **35**. Here's the breakdown: originally there were 4 quartets (16 musicians), 5 duets (10 musicians), and 6 trios (18 musicians), totaling 44 musicians. After the changes, 3 quartets (12 musicians), 3 duets (6 musicians), 5 full trios (15 musicians), and 1 duo (2 musicians) performed, totaling 35 musicians [^notfound].

---

## Initial calculation of musicians

- **Quartets**: 4 quartets × 4 musicians = 16 musicians
- **Duets**: 5 duets × 2 musicians = 10 musicians
- **Trios**: 6 trios × 3 musicians = 18 musicians

Total initially = 16 + 10 + 18 = **44 musicians**

---

## Changes affecting the performance

- **One quartet went on tour**: 4 musicians did not perform
- **Two duets went on tour**: 2 duets × 2 musicians = 4 musicians did not perform
- **One trio became a duo**: 1 musician did not perform (originally 3, now 2)

Total musicians not performing = 4 + 4 + 1 = **9 musicians**

---

## Final calculation of musicians who performed

Total musicians who performed = Initial total − Musicians not performing = 44 − 9 = **35 musicians**

---

## Verification of the calculation

| **Group** | **Initial musicians** | **Musicians not performing** | **Musicians performing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Quartets | 16 | 4 | 12 |
| Duets | 10 | 4 | 6 |
| Trios | 18 | 1 | 17 |
| Total | 44 | 9 | 35 |

---

The final count is **35 musicians**.

Panel 8: The Baumol effect

In the mid-1960s, the economists William J. Baumol and William G. Bowen were trying to understand the economics of the performing arts. They were surprised to find that while musicians were not becoming more productive, their wages were rising. A string quartet performing the same piece of music for the same amount of time earned far more in 1965 than in 1865. Their explanation, called the Baumol effect, has profound implications for healthcare costs: salaries of workers in jobs that see no productivity gains, like musicians and the care dimension of healthcare work, rise in response to rising salaries in other jobs that did see such gains, like manufacturing. As Lee explains in his obituary of Baumol: "An arts institution that insisted on paying musicians 1860s wages in a 1960s economy would find their musicians were constantly quitting to take other jobs". Just as the string quartet cannot increase its productivity by playing faster, many health workers and school teachers cannot increase their productivity because their human clinical interactions take time and labor. Recorded music and computerised instruction do, of course, increase the reach of musicians and teachers, but demand remains for the in-person experience, for which there are no productivity gains.

In a chapter on rising healthcare costs in Baumol's book "The Cost Disease: Why Computers Get Cheaper and Healthcare Doesn't", Pablos-Méndez and colleagues say that too often policymakers blame this rise on aging populations and expensive new health technologies. The Baumol effect, also known as Baumol's cost disease, is an important driver, they argue. But they note that this effect is not just caused by "differential productivity levels in different sectors of the economy", but also by demand for healthcare. If people's incomes are growing from productivity gains elsewhere in the economy, "people seem willing to pay the increasingly high prices for health services", which puts an additional upward pressure on the price of such services.

### Effect of a rehabilitation program on performance-related musculoskeletal disorders in student and professional orchestral musicians: a randomized controlled trial [^90524920]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective:

To explore the feasibility of a rehabilitation program and its effect on the performance-related musculoskeletal symptoms and functional limitations of orchestral musicians.

Design:

Single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial with exercise group and control group.

Setting:

Workplace of professional symphony orchestra and tertiary-level conservatory orchestral musicians.

Participants:

Professional and student orchestral musicians with or without performance-related musculoskeletal disorders.

Interventions:

A rehabilitation program including an educational presentation, an 11-week home exercise program and three supervised exercise sessions, versus no intervention.

Measures:

Feasibility measures included adherence and drop-out rate. The Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for professional orchestra Musicians (MPIIQM) measured symptom intensity and functional limitations, while the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) measured symptom prevalence and frequency.

Results:

A total of 30 participants were recruited (n = 15 per group). Exercise group adherence was 97.7% for the supervised sessions and 89% for the home exercise program. There were no drop-outs. Significant group-time interactions were obtained for both the pain intensity (partial η 2 = 0.166; P = 0.025) and pain interference (partial η 2 = 0.186; P = 0.017) sections of the MPIIQM. Mean (standard deviation) pain intensity score changes from baseline to 11weeks were control group: 0.40 (5.04); P = 0.763; partial η 2 = 0.007; and exercise group: -4.07 (5.31); P = 0.010; partial η 2 = 0.386. For pain interference, mean score changes were control group: 0.20 (9.10); P = 0.933; partial η 2 = 0.001; and exercise group: -9.00 (10.73); P = 0.006; partial η 2 = 0.430. NMQ analyses revealed no significant interaction (P > 0.05).

Conclusion:

Results suggest that the studied program is feasible and effective in decreasing the intensity and functional impact of musicians' symptoms. However, no significant medium-term effect on the prevalence and frequency of symptoms was shown.

### Music lessons: what musicians can teach doctors (and other health professionals) [^bf03637a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Medicine is a learned profession, but clinical practice is above all a matter of performance, in the best and deepest sense of the word. Because music is, at its core, a pure distillate of real-time performance, musicians are in an excellent position to teach us about better ways to become and remain expert performers in health care and ways for our teachers and mentors to help us do that. Ten features of the professionalization of musicians offer us lessons on how the clinical practice of medicine might be learned, taught, and performed more effectively.

### A qualitative study exploring the implementation determinants of rehabilitation and global wellness programs for orchestral musicians [^bc096ce8]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the facilitators and barriers to implementation of a pilot workplace rehabilitation and global wellness program for orchestral musicians.

Design

Qualitative study comprising focus groups and interviews. Setting: Workplace of conservatory and orchestral musicians and administrators.

Participants

Musicians, administrators and a conductor from two professional orchestras; tertiary-level orchestral students and an administrator from a conservatory of music.

Interventions

We held four focus groups and two interviews to document the perspectives of the participants concerning the implementation determinants of a pilot workplace rehabilitation and wellness program (exercises and health-related education). Meetings consisted of questions based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Thematic content analysis was conducted using this same framework, with subcoding according to the Theoretical Domains Framework.

Results

Fourteen musicians and five administrators participated. Results suggest that the implementation determinants for the pilot and future programs rely mainly on the Inner Setting, that is, what musicians refer to as 'the music world', specifically cultural elements such as pain beliefs (e.g. no pain no gain) and lack of resources and time (barriers). Characteristics of Individuals such as social influences amongst colleagues and beliefs about the consequences of self-care or lack thereof, and Intervention Characteristics such as complexity can be facilitators or barriers. All emerging themes have an undercurrent that lies in the Inner Setting.

Conclusion

Musicians' culture, currently a barrier, is a crucial determinant of rehabilitation and wellness program implementation in the orchestral musicians' workplace. A focus on musicians' workplace environment is necessary to optimise implementation and intervention impacts.

### The whole heaven a musical scale and a number [^c2b48a40]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Leyster and some of her contemporaries portrayed children sympathetically, allowing them expressions and emotions, music and art, at a time when many of them did not survive their early years. The child in Boy Playing the Flute has fallen on hard times. He is teetering between poverty and comfortable domesticity. Though he still has a home with a violin hanging on the wall, there is no music master in the room. He is going it alone. But "You sing what you hear", and he hears the harmony above.

While this young musician navigates changing fortunes, he still has an advantage over many of his contemporaries. He is healthy, having so far escaped the scourges of his times, though impending poverty undoubtedly puts him at risk. Pneumonia, diphtheria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, and streptococcal infections were major causes of childhood illness and death, as they still are in much of the world. Some, among them respiratory infections that might have cut the youth's flute career short, are now under control because of expansive vaccination programs, including in today's Netherlands.

But while a young boy might tab into the music of the spheres for inspiration and survival, those who try to break the axiomatic connection between wealth, poverty, health, and illness can only rely on programs aimed at the great killers of children. Persistent and unrelenting disharmony, caused by diseases upon diseases emerging and reemerging amidst endless complicating factors, interferes in public health with their orderly conquest, one by one, in any kind of anticipated pattern or ratio on a cosmic scale.

### Preventing musculoskeletal complaints in music students: a randomized controlled trial [^5095f5a2]. Occupational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal complaints in music students are common. Little is known about effectiveness of interventions.

Aims

To assess whether a biopsychosocial prevention course is better at reducing disability due to musculoskeletal disorders compared with physical activity promotion.

Methods

This was a multicentre randomized controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants were first- and second-year students from five conservatories, randomized to experimental or control groups. The experimental group participated in 11 classes on body posture playing the instrument according to postural exercise therapy, and performance-related psychosocial aspects. The control group participated in five classes promoting physical activity according to national guidelines. The primary outcome was disability using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, including the performing arts module. Secondary outcomes were pain, quality of life, playing-related musculoskeletal disorders and health behaviour. Outcomes were assessed at six points, from baseline until 2-year follow-up.

Results

One hundred and seventy participants were randomized to experimental (n = 84) or control (n = 86) groups. Loss to follow-up was 40% during the trial and 69% at 2-year follow-up. The dropout rate was equal in both groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between groups for any outcome adjusted for baseline characteristics: percentage disability, odds ratio was 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69–2.51; general DASH, β = -0.57, 95% CI -3.23 to 2.09; and performing arts module, β = -0.40, 95% CI 5.12–4.32.

Conclusions

A biopsychosocial prevention course tailored for musicians was not superior to physical activity promotion in reducing disability. Large numbers lost to follow-up warrant cautious interpretation.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In July 2021, Public Health-Seattle & King County investigated a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak at an indoor event intended for fully vaccinated individuals, revealing unvaccinated staff, limited masking, poor ventilation, and overcrowding. Supporting businesses to develop and implement comprehensive COVID-19 prevention plans is essential for reducing spread in these settings.

### Hand sensibility, strength, and laxity of high-level musicians compared to nonmusicians [^cf0caea4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether musicians have more sensitive, stronger, and flexible hands than nonmusicians.

Methods

A total of 100 musicians and 100 control subjects were assessed for 2-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament light touch, grip and pinch strength, and laxity. Musicians were included if enrolled as instrumental performance majors at a 4-year accredited conservatory of music. Nonmusician controls were university students who never or rarely engaged in playing an instrument. All subjects were between the ages of 18 and 28. The exclusion criterion was history of any hand condition, trauma, surgery, or diabetes. Statistical analyses were carried out using the t test, analysis of variance, and correlation coefficients as appropriate.

Results

High-level musicians in our cohort showed the same handedness (dominance) as the general population. The musicians were weaker than the nonmusicians. Male musicians were significantly weaker in pinch and grip bilaterally than nonmusicians, whereas female musicians were significantly weaker only in grip on the right/dominant side. Two-point discrimination was significantly less in musicians for the left/nondominant index, ring, and small fingers, and the right/dominant small and dominant index finger. Semmes-Weinstein testing was significantly better for the right/dominant digits, including the thumb, but not the left digits with the exception of the ring and nondominant middle and ring. There was no difference in laxity between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

High-level musicians have, in general, more sensitive but weaker hands than nonmusicians, but the differences seem small and may not be clinically important.

### Special issues in the medical assessment of musicians [^69ff9f2d]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The health of performing artists may be affected not only by occupational risks but by concomitant illness and injuries also. It is essential that those responsible for their health care have an appreciation of all that is involved in performance careers, including the training, requisites for success, life style issues, and a basic understanding of the mechanics of each performing art form. This article briefly considers why the health care of performing artists necessitates a specialized approach and gives some suggestions for a modus operandi for success.

### Is 27 really a dangerous age for famous musicians? Retrospective cohort study [^d15b31f8]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1 Lexis diagram of musicians with a number one UK album from 1956 to 2007. Each grey line shows a musician's lifetime, starting at their number one album and ending in their death (points) or censoring in 2011

Our sample contained only three deaths at age 27 (in 1969, 1994, and 2011), but there were a few near misses in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We noted a group of relatively young deaths (ages 20 to 40) in the 1970s and early 1980s, followed by an absence of deaths in this age group from 1985 to 1992 despite there being many musicians at risk. There were no deaths at any age between 1985 and 1987.

Figure 2shows the number of deaths at each age and the number of musicians at risk. The death rates per 100 musician years were calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of musicians at risk and multiplying by 100. There were three deaths at age 27 amongst 522 musicians at risk, giving a death rate of 0.57 per 100 musician years. Similar death rates were observed at ages 25 (rate = 0.56) and 32 (rate = 0.54). The smoothed death rate shows a peak at age 32 and no peak at age 27. Risk increased greatly after age 60. The best fit for the smoothed death rate (smallest Akaike information criterion) used seven degrees of freedom.

Fig 2 Smoothed mean death rate per 100 musician years using a spline with a 95% confidence interval (top), mean death rate per 100 musician-years (second from top) number of deaths (third from top), and number of musicians at risk (bottom) by age in years. Age 27 is marked in red. Y axis for smoothed death rates restricted to 0 to 1.4 to focus on the ages of interest. Y axis for mean death rates is on log scale to focus on younger ages

Figure 3shows the death rates in the general UK population by decade of birth, and the smoothed death risk from the top panel of figure 2. Death rates in the UK show the well known steady increase in risk with ageing, and the reduction in risk for younger cohorts. Death rates for the cohort of famous musicians during their 20s and 30s were two to three times higher than in the UK population.

### Reflections on "Orchestrating for impact": harmonizing across stakeholders to accelerate global health gains [^25c1c206]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

For developing countries and partners to accelerate the availability of new innovations to communities in need of intervention, it is necessary to find improved ways to work together that challenge today's status quo in global health. By adopting new approaches and accepting shared risk and reward, diverse partners can work together to accelerate progress toward a common global health goal. A symphony orchestra-with a conductor who recruits, arranges, harmonizes, and orchestrates diverse musicians to work together to create something not possible by individual musicians on their own-provides an apt metaphor for successful global health initiatives. In such settings, stakeholders must be engaged and harmonized, workplans composed, and partnerships conducted such that all stakeholder roles progress from workplans that are sequential and independent to those that are integrated and interactive. Reflecting on the successful global health partnerships discussed here and beyond, we use this orchestral metaphor to illustrate the elements needed to make partnerships increasingly successful.

### The impact of tuberculosis on civilization [^bf75940b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is an ancient disease that has spread in epidemic form among susceptible peoples but has had a little demographic or political impact on the populations it has inflicted. The disease continues to have a large economic impact on societies in which it is prevalent. Tuberculosis has left its mark on human creativity; on the lives of individuals in music, art, and literature; and dramatically on the advance of biomedical science and healthcare.

### Sleep softly: schubert, ethics and the value of dying well [^ea5aeb30]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

To extend the analogy, the narrative or story of someone's life is also crucially affected by how it ends. Tony Bland's story was tragically cut short by the Hillsborough stadium disaster. But there is also a sense that his long period in a vegetative state, his long final chapter, significantly affected the value of his life as a whole.

Another analogy is with music. Just as with literature, a poor conclusion to a piece of music diminishes what has gone before. In classical music, a 'cadence' is a sequence of chords that signal to the listener the end of the piece. One of the most familiar cadences in Western classical music is the so-called 'perfect' cadence. This is a transition from the tonic chord to the dominant, and resolving to the tonic. The end of the second movement of Schubert's Death and the Maiden quartet ends with a series of those cadences — chords moving from G Major to D Major and back to G major. It leaves the listener feeling satisfied that the music has reached its conclusion.

However, there can be much less satisfactory ways of ending a piece of music. An 'interrupted' cadence is one where the transition of chords leaves the listener expecting resolution — but there is none, the dominant chord does not move to the expected tonic — rather to the sixth chord of the scale.

Music can also end badly in another way. Some pieces of music seem to drag on and on — beyond the point when they should have stopped. The composer has run out of musical ideas and repeats material or stretches material unnecessarily. The over-long, extended ending distorts the shape of a piece of music. Like the bad final chapter of a book, or a prolonged dying phase it can affect the value of the whole.

Lives, like pieces of music — can be long and symphonic — with complex structures, many moving parts, multiple themes and transitions. Or they can be brief, concise, fleeting melodies comprising only a few notes or chords. It might seem that the value of a good conclusion is most important with a life or a musical work that is long and complicated and rich in experience and texture.

### Flatboats, travelers, infectious diseases, and other river thoughts [^909db287]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The National Gallery of Art's overview states that "The composition is at once dynamic — the dancing man and the musicians — and elegantly stable in the way Bingham arranged the figures to form an isosceles triangle". The Gallery, which has borrowed and displayed this painting several times since the 1960s, finally purchased it from an undisclosed seller in May 2015.

The painting's symmetry is striking, a point noted in a review of Bingham's river paintings from the New York Times: the rectangular flatboat floats downstream, framed by a peaceful river, misty tree-lined riverbanks, and a pale blue, cloudless sky. A pair of long oars, locked in place, jut off to either side. Front and center, a capering young man, dressed in a red shirt, dances a jig, frozen in mid-step with hands held high. One crew member plays a fiddle, and another keeps time on a pan. Other crewmen watch and listen, several locking eyes with the viewer; another, seen from behind, stretches out in repose, his head resting on his interlocked hands.

### Clusters of coronavirus disease in communities, Japan, January-April 2020 [^cc3092a0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We analyzed 3,184 cases of coronavirus disease in Japan and identified 61 case-clusters in healthcare and other care facilities, restaurants and bars, workplaces, and music events. We also identified 22 probable primary case-patients for the clusters; most were 20–39 years of age and presymptomatic or asymptomatic at virus transmission.

### Investigating generalizability of results from a randomized controlled trial of the management of chronic widespread pain: the MUSICIAN study [^37e11d8f]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Survey respondents who were potentially eligible for the RCT were then mailed information about the trial itself, after which they were contacted by a research nurse to confirm eligibility and arrange an initial assessment appointment in a local clinical research facility. At this appointment if eligibility was confirmed and consent was obtained, randomisation took place.

The primary outcome for the trial was a 7-point, patient global impression change score, assessed by self-completion questionnaire, at 6 and 9 months post-randomisation. Patients were asked to rate how they felt their health had changed since the period before entering the trial, ranging from 1 ("very much worse") to 7 ("very much better"). Questionnaire nonrespondents were asked the same question verbally, by telephone interview.

2.1. Analysis

Firstly, amongst individuals surveyed, responders and nonresponders were compared and among survey respondents eligible for randomisation, differences were examined between those individuals who were/were not subsequently randomised. This was done using χ 2 tests and nonparametric tests for trendand the magnitude of any differences characterised using logistic regression. Thus, differences are expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% Confidence interval (CI)). Secondly, a forward stepwise regression model was constructed, to identify which variables independently predicted randomisation. If not already dichotomous, these variables were then dichotomized and N × 2 categories were created, where N represented the number of factors in the multivariable regression model. The primary trial analysis (presented elsewhere) was then recomputed, weighting for the inverse of the likelihood of randomisation (ie, likelihood of reaching randomisation stage), for every given combination of N × 2 categories. Finally, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for each of the treatments, based on the weighted odds ratios.

Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 11.1 from STATACORP, Texas. Numbers needed to treat were calculated in Microsoft Excel, using published formula.

### How the mighty have fallen: fatal infectious diseases of divine composers [^9b6921e6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Their music is immortal, but famous composers of the last centuries were not. Up to 50 years ago, microbial infections were a major cause of mortality and showed composers no special mercy. They died of various infectious diseases. By application of modern intensive care measurements and effective antibiotics, many of them would have been saved. Disease and painful death brought the work of these divine artists to the level of immortal creations that both inspire and astonish the mortal audience.

### Childcare exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for 4-year-old presymptomatic child, south Korea [^93957b62]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

There were also a few reports of school exposure in older children during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A report of a cluster in the French Alps included a 9-year-old boy who did not transmit SARS-CoV-2 to any other persons, although 112 persons at 3 different schools had contact with him. However, detailed information on exposure at schools was not available for that study. In a report from New South Wales, Australia, there were several high schools and 1 primary school in which many children and adolescents were exposed to a child (index-patient[s]) but few secondary cases resulted. In 15 schools (10 high school and 5 primary schools), 18 COVID-19 cases (in 9 students and 9 staff) were identified during March 5–April 3, 2020. Of 863 identified close contacts, only 2 secondary cases, both in children, resulted from transmission in the school setting; 1 case-patient was infected by another child and the other case-patient by an adult staff member. However, there were no details on exposure setting. In Ireland, for notifications of SARS-CoV-2 infection before school closure in March 2020, there was no transmission from 3 children (index case-patients) among 905 contacts in the school settings. All children who had COVID-19 in Ireland attended schools during the presymptomatic and symptomatic periods, and other children were exposed in a variety of settings, including music lessons (woodwind instruments) and choir practice, both of which are high-risk activities for virus transmission. Studies in France and Ireland performed laboratory tests only for symptomatic persons and might have underestimated asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients. In comparison, we collected test results on all persons at the childcare center in our study.

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^9779f560]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Skepticism and need

In this final section, I address several important points of skepticism regarding the premise of the biological framework presented here, i.e. the hypothesis that music can do more for mental health.

Benefits from music to mental health are already at saturation

In addition to the effects of musical treatment described above (see Sections "Applications of tonality in mental health"., "Applications of rhythm in mental health", "Applications of musical reward in mental health", & "Applications of sociality in mental health".), there is strong evidence that people derive mental health benefits from more casual engagement with music. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, more than half of 4,206 survey respondents reported engaging with music as a coping strategy, using it to derive reward, modulate mood, and/or reduce stress and anxiety. Similar positive functions are apparent in pre-pandemic research as well (alongside more social functions). Associations between music and healing have also been found in many cultures throughout human history, suggesting a potentially ancient relationship. Thus, even though music lies outside the mainstream of mental health care, many people are already using music to improve their condition.

Nonetheless, there are multiple ways in which music's mental health benefits may be increased. First, expanding access to musical treatment is essential; as stated in the introduction, music therapists in the US only have the capacity to treat 0.5% of adults with mental illness. I have argued that this necessitates standardizing and applying treatments within a biological framework. Second, the popular perception of music as entertainment needs to evolve to encompass its therapeutic benefits. Explaining musical treatments in biomedical terms and normalizing therapeutic modes of listening can facilitate this shift. Third, the balance in music education needs to pivot away from individual performance and back towards widespread attainment of basic skills (e.g. social singing and dancing, listening, reflecting, curating, etc.), with an explicit focus on developing lifelong tools for mental health and wellness.

### Medical performance and the 'inaccessible' experience of illness: an exploratory study [^411f68d0]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

Transplant survivors

Summary of comments

All of the transplant patients interviewed (five) indicated that the performance reflected their own experience in many ways, particularly in relation to how they felt physically and emotionally as they went through diagnosis and treatment (and to an extent still feel). As interviewee 4 states "It captured how you felt in that moment and it brought it back to life". This led to complex emotions for some audience members, who found that the performance brought back feelings they did not necessarily want to remember, though this was still perceived as a positive experience. As interviewee 2, who received his transplant just 11 months before seeing the show, explains: "A lot of feelings came back. Also a lot of feelings that I… do not want to remember. But it was OK. It gave me lots of emotions inside".

Responding to the final scene (a duet based on the post-transplant period when patients are at risk of a serious complication, graft-versus-host disease, in which donated cells attack those of the patient), one patient highlighted how the performance reflected physical processes: "The transplantation, the dance between the two bodies. That was a true reflection of the battle between the new stem cells" (interviewee 5 who experienced graft-versus-host disease). Interviewee 7 pointed out that she had learned new medical information from the performance, which she did not remember hearing before, referring to the 'matching' scene described above: "I got information from the play, for example about the HLA types, which I didn't get from my own doctor". HLA (human leucocyte antigen) is the primary means used to match donors for transplantation.

### Investigating generalizability of results from a randomized controlled trial of the management of chronic widespread pain: the MUSICIAN study [^326ea19b]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

A significant trend existed, such that participants with higher BMI (P = 0.03) and higher Chronic Pain Grade (signifying more severe and/or disabling pain) (P = 0.002) were more likely to be randomised than other individuals (Table 1). Participants already taking some exercise (1–2 times/wk) were more likely to be randomised in comparison with those not currently exercising, but those undertaking frequent exercise (> 5 times/wk) were not more likely to be randomised than those not exercising. Participants with a treatment preference were twice as likely to be randomised as those without (2.11; 1.48–3.00), and this effect existed irrespective of whether the preference was for exercise, CBT, or both (Table 2). Positivity about receiving either exercise (2.66; 1.95–3.62) or CBT (3.20; 2.15–4.76) was associated with an increase in the likelihood of randomisation, although no such effect was observed with participant expectations of outcome, for either treatment (Table 2).

### Global musical diversity is largely independent of linguistic and genetic histories [^a9440a7b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Music is a universal yet diverse cultural trait transmitted between generations. The extent to which global musical diversity traces cultural and demographic history, however, is unresolved. Using a global musical dataset of 5242 songs from 719 societies, we identify five axes of musical diversity and show that music contains geographical and historical structures analogous to linguistic and genetic diversity. After creating a matched dataset of musical, genetic, and linguistic data spanning 121 societies containing 981 songs, 1296 individual genetic profiles, and 121 languages, we show that global musical similarities are only weakly and inconsistently related to linguistic or genetic histories, with some regional exceptions such as within Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Our results suggest that global musical traditions are largely distinct from some non-musical aspects of human history.

### "Much madness is divinest sense" [^99e1d70c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Over the next few years, she became increasingly absorbed with art, devoting all her days to work in her studio. Her style and technique evolved rapidly, and she started experimenting, particularly with expression of sounds as visual forms. She interpreted musical scores and converted them to colorful images (Rondo alla Turquoise, Rhapsody in Blue). She became fascinated with the music of Maurice Ravel, particularly his one-movement orchestral piece Boléro.

"Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality?" Ravel asked his friend Gustave Samazeuilh as he fingered the initial melody on the piano, "I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can". This he did. Two melodic themes were repeated eight times over 340 bars. Volume and instrumentation increased along with two alternating staccato bass lines. There was no key change until the 326th bar, when the piece accelerated into a collapsing finale. The result was haunting and infectious, an exercise in compulsion, some said perseveration.

Ravel wrote this his best-known composition while on vacation in the south of France. He was 53. Though the musical scores were marred with spelling errors, he was not yet incapacitated by illness. The success of Boléro, which he had assessed as "a piece for orchestra without music", surprised him. During the premier of the work, a woman was said to exclaim that the composer was mad. Ravel later remarked that she must have understood the piece.

Anne Adams knew nothing of Ravel's illness or her own. But at age 53, she started to work on the painting Unraveling Boléro, a visual analysis of Ravel's composition. She transformed the music into colorful figures, one for each bar. Highly structured and rendered with meticulous detail, they resembled spiky space-age lace hung out to dry in neat monotonous rows. The height of figures corresponded with volume, the shape with note quality, the color with pitch.

### Hand disorders in musicians: the orthopaedic surgeon's role [^78527a6e]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Like athletes, musicians are vulnerable to musculoskeletal injuries that can be career ending or have a severe negative financial impact. All ages are affected, with a peak incidence in the third and fourth decades. Women are slightly more likely to be affected than men. It is incumbent upon orthopaedic surgeons to be able to complete a thorough physical assessment, be aware of the risk factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms in musicians, and have a detailed knowledge of the specific syndromes they suffer and their appropriate treatment. In this paper we review the common hand injuries that afflict musicians and discuss their treatment.

### Large-scale multi-site study shows no association between musical training and early auditory neural sound encoding [^90d7e25b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Statistical analyses

To ensure high-powered analyses for all tests, the data were aggregated across sites. All group comparisons used the same, relatively strict definition of musician and non-musician, as described in the "Recruitment and eligibility" section. This ensured that the definition of musician was generally as strict, if not more so, as the definition used in the original studies. Outliers were identified by visual inspection, and analyses were conducted both with and without outliers. Direct replication analyses used the same statistical tests as the original study. CIs correspond to 95% confidence intervals. The CIs for t -tests are CIs on the mean difference between groups, whereas ANCOVA CIs are on the simple mean difference contrast between groups after adjusting for covariates. CIs for partial correlations were calculated in JASP using 1000 bootstraps. Analyses that treated years of formal musical training as a continuous variable were conducted across the full cohort of participants unless otherwise stated. As the overarching finding across the original studies was that musicianship provides an advantage to sound processing, all corresponding significance tests relating to musicianship were one-tailed with α = 0.05 unless otherwise noted, consistent with our preregistration protocol. In contrast, any tests of differences relating to gender were two-tailed, as there was no strong hypothesis why males or females should have stronger responses. Exploratory analyses that used age and gender as covariates were conducted using ANCOVA with Type III sums of squares for between-group comparisons and partial correlations for continuous comparisons, with gender dummy coded as 1 = female and 2 = male. Participants who did not identify as either male or female were excluded from all gender analyses due to the small sample size of this group (n = 4). The ANCOVA statistical assumptions of linearity and homogeneity of regression slopes were tested by visually inspecting scatterplots, including the regression lines between the covariate and dependent variables for each group. Homogeneity of regression slopes was also tested by ensuring the interaction between the group and covariate had a p value > 0.05. Homogeneity of variances was tested using Levene's test of equality of error variances. Data were analyzed in MATLAB 2016b and JASP.

### Physician, heal thyself with music [^a6628a24]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Music provides proven benefits to health and wellness. Although most published research investigated general populations or patients rather than physicians, the data can be extrapolated and applied to physicians. There is a long history of prominent physician-musicians from numerous medical disciplines. Otolaryngologists are particularly well-suited to incorporate music not only into their lives but also into their practice of medicine. Music produces clear improvements in quality of life and wellness; and participating in musical activities should be studied further and should be encouraged among our colleagues and trainees.

### Stochastic properties of musical time series [^a244396f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In rare cases, the identification of a plateau turned out to be ambiguous. In these PL+P cases, the slope of the plateau (in the log-log-representation) showed a slight variability around 0 (see e.g. Andante of String Quartet No.18 in A major, K. 464" in supplementary Fig. 12). These variations might be the result of a large variance, or mark the beginning of a transition to a plateau in pieces that are too short to allow the PSD-estimation to reach lower frequencies. The behavior of the autocorrelation functions in such cases, however, is not substantially influenced by these small slopes and thus they have no influence on the conclusions of our work.

The finite range of slowly decaying correlations rules out the possibility of statistical self-similarity and never-ending correlations, that was evoked by the lack of bounds in the observation of 1/ f -noise by Voss and Clarke. The findings shown in the present article for pitch time series are based on the analysis of many pieces by various composers from different styles and eras and emphasize the fact that musical time series decorrelate after a certain time. The fact that we did not identify any self-similar compositions does not imply that they are impossible but shows that statistical self-similarity is not a usual feature of musical compositions. While long-range correlated sequences of pitches can easily be generated algorithmically, creating them is usually not a goal for human composers. It would be worthwhile to search for self-similar compositions and to study how they might differ from normal musical pieces.

Power-law behavior also shows up in the PSDs of small random timing fluctuations in musical performances –. In contrast to the results reported in the present article, however, crossovers to plateaus and cutoff frequencies have not been reported in these cases. This important difference is probably due to the purely psychophysical nature of microtiming fluctuations. Similarly one finds power law behavior in sensorimotor experiments on tapping strength fluctuations. Small random microtiming fluctuations are involuntary, they are ubiquitous in performances, and they do not play a musical role, as was shown e.g. for the swing feel in jazz. This is not true for systematic microtiming deviations, however. They do have a function in musical performances and they were shown to play a key role for the swing feel in jazz.

### Investigating generalizability of results from a randomized controlled trial of the management of chronic widespread pain: the MUSICIAN study [^6e45c14b]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Differences in demographics and health, between eligible survey participants who were/were not randomised.

Table 2
Differences in treatment preference and expectation, between eligible survey participants who were/were not randomised.

Five factors were found to be independently associated with randomisation (ie, reaching the randomisation step in the recruitment process): age, positivity about exercise, positivity about CBT, more severe disabling Chronic Pain Grade, and taking regular exercise. Weighting the analysis by the inverse of the likelihood of randomisation (essentially, simulating the effect of all eligible nonparticipants actually being randomised) resulted in slight difference in the treatment effect estimates at both 6 and 9 months. For the single therapies, at 6 months, the weighted model resulted in an 11% decrease in the magnitude of treatment effect for CBT (from an odds ratio of 6.45; 2.42–17.2 to 5.72; 1.92–17.0) and a 25% decrease in the treatment effect associated with exercise (from 7.28; 2.79–19.0 to 5.49; 1.89–16.0). In contrast, the weighted model gave a 16% increase in the estimate of treatment effect of the combined therapy (Table 3). The same pattern was true at 9 months, although the magnitude of the changes in effect estimates was less (5% decrease, 11% decrease, and 19% increase, respectively). For CBT, the weighted model produced no change in the number needed to treat. However, for exercise, there was an increase in the NNT from 4 to 5, for improvement at 6 months, and from 7 to 8 for improvement at 9 months. For the combined therapy, NNT fell from 5 to 4 for improvement at 9 months.

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^f88900c0]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Every day, hundreds of millions of people make or listen to music. This appetite is driven by music's core effects on emotion, reward, and affiliation. The value we place on these effects supports a 200 billion dollar per year industry in the US alone. More and more, music's core effects have come into focus for their alignment with core dimensions of mental health, e.g. mood, motivation, pleasure, and social functioning. Together with rapidly increasing awareness of mental health's humanistic and financial importance, this alignment has sparked new investments in music-based interventions from government and industry. This interest presents an opportunity for proponents of music's therapeutic value to increase the specificity and rigor of its application and enhance our understanding of its clinical scope and efficacy.

Meeting this goal depends on a clear conception of music's underlying biology as a source of principles for systematic applications towards specific clinical and subclinical goals. An awareness of such principles exists in music therapy, especially "neurologic" music therapies for motor rehabilitation, but applications in mental health remain highly variable, making it difficult to achieve a unified biologically-informed approach. Moreover, there are far too few music therapists to meet current mental health needs. In the US, for example, there are only about 10,000 board-certified music therapists, compared to about 58 million adults living with mental illness. Assuming an average weekly caseload of 30 patients, total capacity to treat is therefore just 0.5%. Musicians represent another important source of insight, as they are ultimately the most skilled at titrating music's neurophysiological impact. However, the inherently subjective nature of their "artistic" approach can preclude direct integration within a scientific model of health.

### Five actions for five people: emergency cesarean section protocol [^aacad8ef]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Performing an emergency cesarean section requires the activation of strict operative protocols. However, this is often not sufficient. Delays can occur due to simple communication failures despite adherence to protocols. Sometimes, conflicts arise in the actions of individual actors, especially in emergency situations. These actions are counterproductive because they hinder the work of others, even if they are necessary but not at that moment. Significant loss of time is the final result.

The concept of time in obstetrics is essential, and often the definition of urgency, the 30-minute rule, is not satisfactory. There are clinical conditions, fortunately of low incidence, such as abruptio placentae, umbilical cord prolapse, and uterine rupture, in which a cesarean section must be performed quickly because of "immediate threat to the life of the woman or fetus". In these cases, the time taken from the decision to perform a cesarean section to the skin incision must be much shorter.

Therefore, it is critical to develop a series of quick, precise, and coordinated actions among team members. Such actions follow a temporal order, not according to their importance, but according to the necessary sequence that matches those of the team. The team leader must coordinate the entire team like a conductor of an orchestra, and musicians have a perfect understanding of timing and the order of their own actions.

Each childbirth hospital should adopt established protocols for emergency cesarean section. It is clear that training can contribute to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes, compared with no training. However, there are no recognized protocols that define the necessary actions for each operator and for each event.

The purpose of this work is to establish a sequence of actions to be performed by each operator in an emergency situation which requires emergency cesarean section. Once the various sequences were agreed, we then carried out a series of simulations to verify the time taken from the moment of the decision to the time of incision of the patient's skin. We then evaluated how each operator responded to this protocol and how it fit with the teamwork concept.

### Large-scale multi-site study shows no association between musical training and early auditory neural sound encoding [^052572da]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Although the existing evidence has been interpreted as supporting the notion that musicians exhibit advantages in the neural encoding of sound in the early stages of the auditory system, several factors complicate this interpretation and the generalizability of any such advantage. First, most reports have been based on relatively small samples of listeners, with dichotomous samples that often represent extreme ends of the musical spectrum (i.e. people with little or no musical training compared to musicians with many years of experience). Limiting the sample in this manner increases the likelihood that between-group differences will be detected, but such disparate groups may differ in many other ways besides musicianship, such as socio-economic status or personality, which in turn limits the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, most studies have been conducted on young (college-aged) adults, further limiting the generalizability, although a growing number of studies have examined aging effects –. Another complicating factor is that the measures that revealed differences between musicians and non-musicians sometimes differed between studies, — even when the same stimuli were used (see Supplementary Table 1), increasing the potential for false positives. Lastly, the definition of the terms "musician" and "non-musician" has varied between studies, leading to the possibility that any differences in outcomes between studies may reflect, in part, differences in years and nature of training, age training began, and the degree to which musical training or activity is maintained.

In the present study, we attempted to replicate two of the most widely cited findings of a musician advantage for early neural encoding of speech sounds, described above, across a large sample of participants at six different sites. In addition to conducting the replications, we extended these studies in several important ways: (1) All sites conducted both studies, allowing for a high-powered aggregate sample. (2) All participants at each site were asked to take part in both studies, allowing for the strength of neural encoding between studies to be compared within the same participants. (3) Both age and musical training varied continuously, increasing the generalizability of the findings, relative to previous studies, while still allowing for a direct replication by maintaining a subset of participants who fit the most stringent criteria for the definitions of musicians and non-musicians. (4) The methods and primary analyses were preregistered before beginning data collection, limiting researcher degrees of freedom when analyzing the data. (5) All data used in analyses are openly available for further exploratory analysis in future studies.

### Music therapy in adult hospices: a national multicentre survey [^ed3e6dba]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 56.8 million people worldwide need to receive palliative care each year. However, only 14% of these people receive palliative care. In Italy, the need for palliative care in the adult population is estimated to be between 1% and 1.4%. In the end of life, the incidence is about 293 000 patients per year, 60% of whom have chronic degenerative non-oncologic diseases and the remaining 40% have cancer.

Palliative care aims to improve quality of life, alleviate suffering and manage physical, psychological, social and spiritual pain in individuals of all ages living with incurable diseases, particularly those in the end stages of life. Adopting a holistic approach, palliative care involves an interdisciplinary and multi-professional team approach supporting not only patients but also their caregivers during illness and in the bereavement process.

Music is an integral part of this holistic approach, and a range of musical care practices are observed in palliative care, including live music performance, community choirs and music thanatology practices. Such practices can be mapped across a 'specialist-everyday' and a 'private-public' continuum of care. As such, some musical care practices may involve, for example, a qualified music therapist facilitating an individual session with a patient retaining clear therapeutic boundaries and respecting the person's privacy and confidentiality. Other musical care practices, however, may pertain to live music events within open community settings for death education purposes.

Forming a distinct professional field of practice alongside other music-based interventions, music therapy has received increased attention in the past decades as an integrative non-pharmacological intervention in palliative care (figure 1). As a fundamentally relational practice, music therapy adapts according to each person's needs and each setting, and it has diverse applications across a musical care continuum — including individual, group and community-oriented applications. The relevance and prioritisation of such applications are informed by numerous factors, including the music therapist's training background and approach, as well as wider professional and sociocultural agendas.

### Large-scale multi-site study shows no association between musical training and early auditory neural sound encoding [^a1a91a07]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To determine if age and gender were masking any effect of musicianship on F0-tracking fidelity, an exploratory analysis tested for a musician advantage while adjusting for age and gender. There was still no benefit of musicianship on F0 tracking, either with [F (1,139) = 1.29, p = 0.257, CI [−0.239, 0.064], ƞ p 2 = .009] or without [F(1,138) = 2.09, p = 0.151, CI [−0.256, 0.04], ƞ p 2 = 0.015] the musician outlier with the poorest encoding included.

The original studyfound that the age of onset of musical training as well as years of musical training were correlated with the fidelity of F0 tracking, assessed via the F0 stimulus-to-response correlation. We used the full cohort of participants (excluding those with 0 years of musical training) to test whether age of onset of training was related to F0 tracking (Fig. 4c). We also tested the hypothesis that F0 tracking improves with years of musical training by calculating the correlation between years of formal musical training and the F0 stimulus-to-response correlation (including those with no musical training, as in the original study; Fig. 4b). The preregistered criterion for significance included Bonferroni correction for two comparisons (α = 0.025). Unlike the original study, which included 16 participants, we found no relationship between the age of onset of musical training and the fidelity of neural encoding of time-varying stimulus F0 (Fig. 4c; r = −0.025, p = 0.354, CI [−1, 0.084]), with the data 8.77 times more likely to occur under the null than the alternative hypothesis (BF −0 = 0.114; Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, the relationship between years of formal musical training and the fidelity of F0 tracking was not significant (Fig. 4b; r = 0.057, p = 0.178, CI [−0.045, 1]), with moderate evidence that the data originate under the null hypothesis (BF +0 = 0.192). Exploratory partial correlations controlling for age and gender (Bonferroni-corrected α = 0.025; Supplementary Fig. 9) confirmed no relationship between age of onset of musical training and F0 stimulus-to-response correlations (r p = −0.004, p = 0.476, CI [−0.125, 0.135]) or years of formal musical training and F0 stimulus-to-response correlations (r p = 0.057, p = 0.178, CI [−0.057, 0.185]). However, F0 tracking did worsen with age (r = −0.173, p = 0.002, CI [−1, −0.073]), consistent with the expected degradation of spectral neural encoding with age. There was no relationship between gender and F0 tracking [t (260) = 0.901, p = 0.368, CI [−0.058, 0.156]].

### Patient-reported improvements in health are maintained 2 years after completing a short course of cognitive behaviour therapy, exercise or both treatments for chronic widespread pain: long-term results from the MUSICIAN randomised controlled trial [^00b1e9c3]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, our study has demonstrated for the first time that a short course of either tCBT or exercise for persons with CWP can result in long-term improvements in patients' global assessment of their condition, compared with TAU. There does not appear to be substantial advantage from providing both interventions. Our work has identified features of patients who may be more likely to respond to tCBT. Finally tCBT has been shown not only to be effective but also highly cost-effective. Future research should focus on: the mechanism by which these improvements might occur; identification of which patients are likely to derive most benefit from these types of non-pharmacological interventions; and investigate novel ways of delivery to further reduce the cost of provision.

### Music and medicine: promoting harmony for health [^42477e39]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A multitude of clinical trials measuring hemodynamic and psychological parameters have shown the beneficial effects of music on health. However, there are no clear instructions on how to utilize the potential benefits of music to improve health outcomes. Moreover, whether the effect of music is transient or enduring has yet to be determined. To address the effect of music on vital parameters and emotional well-being of patients we provide an overview of methods and findings of some studies that have evaluated the physiological or psychological impacts of music. This review puts forward a proposed model for fostering an individualized approach that can examine the therapeutic effects of music.

### New flutes document the earliest musical tradition in southwestern Germany [^70abfd08]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Considerable debate surrounds claims for early evidence of music in the archaeological record. Researchers universally accept the existence of complex musical instruments as an indication of fully modern behaviour and advanced symbolic communication but, owing to the scarcity of finds, the archaeological record of the evolution and spread of music remains incomplete. Although arguments have been made for Neanderthal musical traditions and the presence of musical instruments in Middle Palaeolithic assemblages, concrete evidence to support these claims is lacking. Here we report the discovery of bone and ivory flutes from the early Aurignacian period of southwestern Germany. These finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe, more than 35,000 calendar years ago. Other than the caves of the Swabian Jura, the earliest secure archaeological evidence for music comes from sites in France and Austria and post-date 30,000 years ago.

### Performance anxiety in professional musicians: a systematic review on prevalence, risk factors and clinical treatment effects [^d754e816]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Music performance anxiety (MPA) is one of the most common disorders among professional musicians, nevertheless, little is known about the disease. With this systematic review, prevalence, risk factors and treatment procedures for MPA were assessed, and for the first time, quality assessments were carried out for all studies using standardized assessment tools. A systematic literature search was conducted via search algorithms in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycArticles, PsycInfo and ERIC. Included were case reports, case-control, cohort, cross-sectional and intervention studies examining professional musicians with MPA. For quality assessment, adapted tools of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute were used. A total of 43 studies were included (10 case reports, 21 intervention, 11 cross-sectional, one cohort study). Quality ratings ranged from -11 to 6 out of a maximum of 15/16 points for cross-sectional/cohort studies and -4 to 11 out of 18 points for intervention studies. The prevalence of MPA was between 16.5% and 60%. More women than men were affected and musicians older than 45–50 years reported less MPA than younger musicians. Regarding treatment cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and β-blockers were most often researched with beneficial results for CBT. However, studies with adequate control groups for CBT interventions are needed to clarify its efficacy. Studies showed methodological weaknesses, especially in the selection of participants, recording of influencing factors, blinding of interventions, randomization of participants and analysis of comorbidity. Recommendations for further research are made.

BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Musical culture / control group

Evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months after intervention onset by the teachers, and at 3 and 12 months after intervention onset by professional musicians that do not follow the courses otherwise. The participants are evaluated on 6 different 5-point Likert scales, concerning 1) group ambiance, 2) individual participation, 3) interaction (individual), 4) joy (individual), 5) motivation / homework (individual), 6) general progress (individual).
A multiple choice questionnaire involving musical knowledge and listening is passed at t0, t1, t2 and t3
Slow up-and-down playing of a scale of 5 notes at a pace of 76 beats per minutes indicated by a metronome, with 1 note per beat, c-d-e-f-g (so no position change) at the central octave of the piano is recorded (MIDI) at t0, t1, t2 and t3.

Both groups also complete a training amount questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (see Table 3 "Homework questionnaire") of intervention, indicating how much time per day and per week each participant spent on homework on average over the last 3 months. These progress and training amount measures will be linked in the final analyses to other brain and behavioral measures.

Data monitoring and quality assurance

At each site data acquisition and quality is constantly monitored by experimenters for each participant (Damien Marie and Laura Abdili in Geneva, Florian Worschech, Kristin Jünemann and Christopher Sinke in Hannover). Progress meetings (by Skype) are organized regularly between both sites. A second quality check is performed on the server where all data are backed up (see Declarations, Availability of data and materials, p. 16) and analyzed by Damien Marie (see Declarations p. 16). A third checkup is performed by an independant Data Manager (scientific collaborator at PhD level) both at the the HEdS-GE and the HMTMH, after each data point.

We will report reasons for withdrawal of individuals for each randomization group. Exact information on missing data at each time point will be reported in all publications. Missing data will be processed in the analyses with cutting edge means (for instance using the regularized iterative Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm developed by Josse, Husson and Pagès (2009), implemented in the R package missMDA.

### Common musculoskeletal problems in the performing artist [^708196d2]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

In this chapter we touched on a wide variety of unique musculoskeletal conditions in the musician and dancer. We outlined generalized methods of evaluation that stress the importance of the interdisciplinary approach in this highly specialized patient population and stressed the importance of specific involvement of the music or dance instructor in evaluation and management. We sought to emphasize the need to refer to specialized care early when in doubt of diagnosis or when usual first-line treatments fail. We gave examples of specific injury patterns common in these subgroups and suggestions for early management. Finally, we described some general principals for prevention of musculoskeletal injury in this group. A physician treating the performing artist must always keep in mind that in this unique patient population, their occupation is not only a means of earning a living, it is their passion. Artists make great sacrifice both physically and mentally to bring the world such immeasurable beauty.

### Incidence and relative risk of hearing disorders in professional musicians [^46fb8fd9]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Definition of professional musician

Registration with a given SHI is usually done through the employer who records key sociodemographic characteristics of the insurant, including his/her occupation. Freelance musicians are eligible to register themselves via a specific artists' social insurance agency (Künstlersozialkasse). Professional musicians were identified using the Standard Classification of Occupations, which is used by the Federal Employment Agency. The corresponding code comprises rock/pop or classical instrumental musicians, singers, conductors and composers. A professional musician was defined as an insurant who had had at least one insurance period in the study period from 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2008 coded as 'musician'.

Case definition

Cases were defined as cohort members with a diagnosis of HL — that is, an outpatient or hospital diagnosis with at least one of the following ICD-10-GM codes: H83.3 noise effects on inner ear, H90 conductive and sensorineural hearing loss or H93.1 tinnitus. Additionally, we defined four subentities of HL: NIHL if the ICD-10-GM code was H83.3, conductive HL if the codes H90.0 to H90.2 were used, sensorineural HL if the codes H90.3 to H90.5 were used, combined conductive and sensorineural HL if the code H90.6 was used and tinnitus if the code H93.1 was used.

Statistical analysis

We calculated incidence rates of HL, and incidence rates for the subentities NIHL, conductive HL, sensorineural HL, combined conductive and sensorineural HL and tinnitus stratified by age, sex and federal state. CIs for the incidence rates were estimated by the substitution method assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events.

A Cox proportional hazards model was calculated to estimate adjusted HRs and two-sided 95% CIs for HL and its subentities, taking into account the differing observation periods between cohort members. The time scale for the Cox regression was the number of days each person was observed in cohort.

In the sensitivity analyses, adjustments were made for sex and age at cohort entry (continuous variables), for population density of place of residence (categorised as cities, concentrated surrounding areas, rural surrounding areas and rural areas), SHI and federal state.

All statistical analyses were done using SAS V.9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) and the proportional hazards assumption was tested with the ASSESS option.

### Types, frequencies and burden of health problems in elite luge athletes: a 46-week prospective cohort study [^5709eda1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

It should be noted that the total number of cases in this cohort is relatively small, as is frequently the case with studies on professional athletes. Statistical statements may potentially remain non-significant for this sole reason. Nevertheless, members of five national teams were included in this study in order to achieve the largest possible cohort. Given the limited number of athletes available in this sport and specifically at this level of performance, the sample can in the opinion of the authors not be greatly expanded. The athletes' self-reporting of health problems could lead to some variation in the accuracy of specific diagnoses, and therefore, represents a further limitation. Nevertheless, this was deliberately chosen in order to document all injuries, even those that remained without medical attention. Potential recall bias was best accounted for by the choice of the survey interval. It should also be noted that the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the proportion of time loss due to infections may potentially be overestimated, partly due to illnesses and partly due to legal requirements or due to quarantine regulations imposed by the relevant sports associations.

### Movement disorders in musicians [^ccb2e2ce]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The focus of this article is to review the epidemiology, phenomenology, pathophysiology, genetics, and treatment of movement disorders, particularly task-specific dystonia, in musicians. The goal is to draw attention to this group of neurological disorders among musicians, music teachers, and healthcare professionals and to highlight the importance of early diagnosis, therapeutic options, and preventive measures. To increase professional and public awareness and to facilitate the recognition of music-related neurological problems, we suggest that "medical problems of musicians" be included in curriculum of music schools and medical schools.

### Stochastic properties of musical time series [^d04ac5b9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Jazz improvisations

As classical music compositions typically show more structure and musical form than jazz improvisations, we may expect somewhat different autocorrelation behaviors and consequently different behaviors of the PSDs. We therefore study jazz improvisations as a separate category. Similarly as for the classical music scores, we find PL and PL+P structures (see Fig. 7). For the jazz improvisations, however, pure PL structures are extremely rare (see Table 1) and show up only in short solos, where the large bandwidth W technically precludes the observation of plateaus. The cutoff periods for the crossover from power-law to plateau also show more variability than in classical pieces (Fig. 5). There is a higher density of points around 128 and 256 quarter notes (32 and 64 bars in 4/4 time signature), which represent typical durations of jazz solos.

### Acquisition of musical skills and abilities in older adults-results of 12 months of music training [^3151a7f5]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The MC group followed a set curriculum, but which included some flexibility to incorporate specific preferences, experiences, and interests of the participants. Only the first three sessions were standardized in the PP group, allowing for individualization in subsequent sessions due to anticipated variability in musical abilities and learning progress. However, several core principles were emphasized to guarantee the consistency of piano instruction: implementation of the provided materials; incorporation of physical warm-up routines; emphasis on attentive listening; practicing bimanual coordination; and music reading (see Supplementary material 1).

Weekly PP and MC sessions lasted 60 min and were conducted by teachers (N = 26; 19 PP and 7 MC) who held at least a bachelor's degree in musical performance and education with piano or a different principal instrument (N = 21), music education (N = 3), or music theory (N = 2). The teachers also had several years of teaching experience in local music universities, received specialized training in teaching older adults, and were supervised by university-level professors of music education and piano pedagogy. The involvement of numerous teachers helped avoid the influence of a specific teaching style. In the second half of the study, the global COVID-19 pandemic led to a temporary conversion to online intervention delivery. However, for all participants, at least the initial two measurements (T0 and T1, described below) were unaffected by the pandemic.

Measurements

Outcome data were acquired at baseline (T0) and at 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2), and six months follow-up (T3) timepoints. Three months into the intervention, participants were asked to report the amount of time they spend on homework and practice at home. This information was also collected at T1 and T2. To assess the progress of piano performance in the PP group, recordings of a specific musical piece were made after three and twelve months of practice. Figure 1 shows the intervention process and testing schedule.

CRIq (Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire)

The Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) was used to assess the cognitive reserve of the participants. This was based on their educational background, work experience, and frequency of engaging in leisure activities, such as sports, culture, and travel. A score below 70 indicates a very low cognitive reserve, while a score above 130 indicates a high cognitive reserve.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^d433c9fc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic interventions for ICU sleep and circadian disruption (SCD) — the ability to initiate or maintain sleep is hampered by anxiety, pain, and preexisting sleep disorders, and relaxation techniques aimed at reducing stress have been associated with improved subjective sleep quality and, in some studies, increased total sleep time. A systematic review of 11 music therapy studies found consistent associations between music therapy and reduced anxiety or stress in critically ill patients, although data on music's direct impact on sleep are more limited. Incorporating patient sleep preferences and a pilot "comfort cart" offering sleep-promoting items were associated with subjective sleep improvements, and, barring contraindications, continuing preexisting outpatient treatments for sleep disorders seems straightforward. Workshop members noted that personalization may be potentially beneficial but increases protocol complexity and that asking about sleep and showing empathy is helpful and may raise team awareness.

### Is there a dose-response relationship between musical instrument playing and later-life cognition? A cohort study using EPIC-Norfolk data [^3f26d8ea]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Musical instrument playing provides intellectual stimulation, which is hypothesised to generate cognitive reserve that protects against cognitive impairment. Studies to date have classified musicianship as a binary entity. This investigation draws on the dataset of the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer Norfolk study to examine the effect of frequency of playing on later-life cognition.

Methods

We compared three categorisations of self-reported musical playing frequency in late mid-life (12-month period) against cognitive performance measured after a 4–11 year delay, adjusted for relevant health and social confounders. Logistic regression models estimated the adjusted association between frequency of musical playing and the likelihood of being in the top and bottom cognitive deciles.

Results

A total of 5,693 participants (745 musicians) provided data on music playing, cognition and all co-variables. Classification of musicianship by frequency of playing demonstrated key differences in socio-demographic factors. Musicians outperformed non-musicians in cognition generally. Compared with non-musicians, frequent musicians had 80% higher odds of being in the top cognitive decile (OR 1.80 [95% CI 1.19–2.73]), whereas musicians playing at any frequency had 29% higher odds (95% CI 1.03–1.62). There was evidence of a threshold effect, rather than a linear dose-response relationship.

Discussion

This study supports a positive association between late mid-life musical instrument playing and later-life cognition, although causation cannot be assumed. Musicians playing frequently demonstrated the best cognition. 'Musicians' are a heterogeneous group and frequency of music playing seems a more informative measure than binary classification. Ideally, this more nuanced measure would be collected for different life course phases.

### Phenotypic spectrum of musician's dystonia: a task-specific disorder? [^d8f7d099]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Musician's dystonia (MD) is traditionally considered a sporadic and task-specific movement disorder.

Methods

The phenotypic spectrum of the disorder was studied in 116 patients suffering from MD including videotaping.

Results

Based on the movement disorders observed, we categorized our patients into two different groups: (i) 65 patients with isolated MD, that is only present when playing the instrument and (ii) 51 patients with MD and one or more additional features of primary dystonia independent of MD (complex MD). Patients with a positive family history of movement disorders had an increased risk to develop complex MD [odds ratio = 4.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.94–11.92; P = 0.001].

Discussion

In previous studies, we recently identified 22 relatives with different types of movement disorders in the families of 28 MD patients. Taken together, our results further support a genetic contribution to MD with a broad individual and familial phenotypic spectrum consisting of MD, other dystonias and even other, non-dystonic movement disorders.

### Modularity of music processing [^cae738aa]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

The music faculty is not a monolithic entity that a person either has or does not. Rather, it comprises a set of neurally isolable processing components, each having the potential to be specialized for music. Here we propose a functional architecture for music processing that captures the typical properties of modular organization. The model rests essentially on the analysis of music-related deficits in neurologically impaired individuals, but provides useful guidelines for exploring the music faculty in normal people, using methods such as neuroimaging.

### Large-scale multi-site study shows no association between musical training and early auditory neural sound encoding [^949caba3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Does musical ability account for failures to replicate?

Our criteria for the groups of "musician" and "non-musician" were at least as strict as in both original studies, so the failure to replicate any musician advantages in neural encoding is unlikely to be due to our group definitions. However, musical expertise or aptitude, rather than years of training, may be a more sensitive measure for detecting differences in neural encoding of sound. We tested this hypothesis directly by correlating an objective measure of musical ability (same/different melody discrimination)with our four measures of neural encoding fidelity: (1) spectral encoding for the F0, (2) spectral encoding of the upper harmonics for /da/ in babble, (3) stimulus-to-response correlations for /da/, and (4) F0 tracking for /mi3/ in quiet. Consistent with prior work, we found that musicians had better melody discrimination than non-musicians [t (160) = 10.3, p < 0.0001, CI [0.774, ∞], d = 1.63], and this relationship generalized across the full sample of participants when treating years of formal musical training as a continuous variable (r = 0.476, p < 0.0001, CI [0.399, 1]; Fig. 5). However, there was no relationship between the objective measure of musical ability and any of the four measures of sound neural encoding (Fig. 6; see Supplementary Fig. 11 for results with the non-musician outlier excluded).

### A novel method of teaching english to people with mild cognitive impairment using songs: a randomized controlled trial protocol [^51cc7fd5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Unit 3. Song: "Rock around the clock"

"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley has been chosen because of its dancing rhythm and because it is so famous that most of the learners have heard it before. We relate this song to numbers and time since it repeats numbers 1–12 many times, and it also repeats the expression "o'clock" which is helpful to learn how to tell time. When we teach the song to the learners, we must teach it at a slower speed, go line by line, and be very patient because many repetitions may be needed. Also, this song is considered as the first rock and roll style. It is a very rhythmic song composed in a major key, and it uses the sequence of chords I, IV, and V. It is catchy, which helps to memorize the numbers and encourages listeners to move their bodies to the rhythm of the music.

BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Control group: musical culture 3

Courses take place in groups of 4 to 6 individuals in order to create a stimulating environment. Lessons involve learning about the timbre and functioning of different musical instruments, music history, learning about composers, styles, etc. Presented music includes medieval, renaissance, classical, romantic and also modern classical repertoire, comprising orchestra and chamber music, opera, but also world music of all 4 continents and other styles (for instance music from the south Americas, jazz, pop, funk, etc.). During the highly interactive courses, the teacher explains the structure of the pieces, the role of the different instruments and voices and affective aspects of the pieces and develops a structured way of listening ("auditory analysis") among the participants. During the lessons music related vocabulary may be written down, reassembling those terminologies in a notebook is part of the homework. Each week a voluntary participant presents music of his/her choice. The support material consists of extracts from textbooks, internet pages, documentaries, radio broadcasts, and presentations (f.i. "TED talks",) and links for listening mainly of YouTube videos and audio material. Internet links and other materials for the upcoming course are provided in the week preceding the lessons. Homework involves resuming the course, listening to different musical pieces, reading texts and preparing presentations. Participants are continuously encouraged to express why he/she appreciates, or not, particular pieces or styles of music.

Measurements and procedures

Subjects will be tested at 4 time points (t0: baseline, t1: after 6 months, t2: after training completion (12 months), t3: 6 months after training completion (18 months)) on 1) cognitive, perceptual and sensorimotor abilities by means of a battery of psychometric tests (Table 4) as well as via 2) wide-ranging functional and structural neuroimaging data (Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI; see Table 5 and 3) Blood sampling.

### Using music to develop a multisensory communicative environment for people with late-stage dementia [^3ab98a58]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Research Design and Methods

This study employed a qualitative, longitudinal design influenced by classic grounded theory (CGT) and video analysis as established by. According to, the use of visual CGT provides a way of eliciting meaning from people who express themselves primarily using nonverbal means as it allows for careful observation of subtle or nuanced communication. Classic grounded theory was used over other qualitative methods as it supports the development of a theoretical understanding grounded in social experiences.

Participants

Participants included eight adults with advanced dementia who lived in the same residential care home (Table 1). Diagnosis was made by National Health Service physicians prior to admittance to the care home. Level of dementia impairment was determined by the clinical dementia rating scale. This scale measures impairment from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) across six areas (memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Additional participants were staff members from the care home (three to five per session) and professional musicians (three each session) trained in the Music for Life intervention.

Table 1.
Participant Demographics

Procedure

Ethical considerations and consent

An ethics panel at Canterbury Christ Church University approved the study (ID: 18–075). Participants (given pseudonyms) were in the advanced stages of dementia and lacked the capacity to give consent; their legal guardians provided this on their behalves in line with Mental Capacity Act recommendations (MCA;). No family guardian declined to give consent. Thewas followed throughout the research.

Intervention

The intervention involved 8-hr-long live music sessions adhering to a similar format each week: an opening piece based on a musical theme involving harp, flute, and oboe, followed by the "welcome song", which was same piece each week led by one of the musicians singing "welcome" to each resident and naming them individually. Improvised group and one-on-one music then followed and continued throughout the session. An ending piece based on the same musical material as the opening piece, completed each session. Musicians and participants played a range of instruments throughout the intervention (Table 2).

### Research prioritization in migrant health in Ireland: toward a participatory arts-based paradigm for academic primary care [^cc009f4b]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context: People are experts in their own health and need to be involved in health-related decisions, including decisions about what issues should be researched. Underserved communities, such as refugees and migrants, are often excluded from having a voice in relation to their priorities for health research. To avoid tokenistic participation, it is important to develop and test innovative methodologies that are culturally attuned and that can offer 'whole person' (affective, creative and cognitive) engagement. The Participatory Irish World Music Café, first developed in the context of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme in 2015, uses music and singing to develop inclusive, social and creative spaces to support social integration. It has been adapted during COVID-19 as an on-line café. While the café has sustained a strong community presence for five years, its potential adaptation and use to support research health prioritisation processes is unknown. Objective: Explore the use of an on-line, participatory Irish World Music Café to generate research priorities about migrant health in Ireland. Study Design: Participatory health research study co-designed with community partners, using a qualitative ethnographic and arts-based framework. Data from six 1.5 hour on-line cafes includes interviews, focus groups and arts-based documentation generated during the cafes. Analysis follows principles of thematic analysis. Setting or Dataset: Community-based participatory study in Ireland Population studied: Refugees, migrants, primary care providers, national health service planners, artists and academics working in the field of migrant health (n = 25) Intervention/Instrument (for interventional studies): n/a Outcome Measures: n/a. Results: Analysis is underway and will describe participants' shared and differential experiences of (i) the research prioritisation sessions with particular attention to their experience of using music and other artistic practices (ii) cultural attunement and whole person engagement and (iii) generating identified research priorities. Conclusions: Findings will inform the evidence base about music as an arts-based method to support a new, inclusive participatory arts-based paradigm for migrants' involvement in research prioritisation. The work will be disseminated in Ireland and in the 53 Member States of the WHO Euro region.

Acute altitude illness — supplemental oxygen — Oxygen delivered by a nasal cannula or mask at flow rates sufficient to relieve symptoms provides a suitable alternative to descent, and supplemental oxygen should be administered to target an S p O2 of > 90% rather than a specific fraction of inspired oxygen; use of low-flow oxygen (1–2 L/min) for ≥ 2 h has much greater benefit than short bursts, and we recommend that, when available, ongoing supplemental oxygen sufficient to raise S p O2 to > 90% or relieve symptoms can be used while waiting to initiate descent or when descent is not practical. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Emergence of collective oscillations in massive human crowds [^72996fa6]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Image acquisition, density and velocity measurements in the 2010 Love Parade

In this section, we explain the origin of the data and the process of converting raw images into quantitative data.

The Love Parade 2010

The Love Parade 2010 was a music festival held in July in Duisburg, Germany. During the event, 21 people died and more than 500 were injured at the main entry of the festival area (Extended Data Fig. 8). This traumatic event has been the subject of numerous scientific studies, also because a number of videos showing the convergence towards the catastrophe have been publicly released.

Videos

Numerous recordings from mobile phones and cameras are available on the internet. The organizer released some camera footage of the main entry where the catastrophes occurred, before they happened. We selected two clips (clip 1 from 14:04 to 15:46 and clip 2 from 19:24 to 19:49) where we observed high-amplitude motion of the crowd.

Image correction protocol

We were unable to perform any image correction on the Love Parade 2010 data.

Density measurement

We were unable to measure the density in clip 1 owing to the low resolution, which hindered detection and manual annotation. In clip 2, we annotated one image. We estimated the area covered by the field of view by measuring the shoulder-to-shoulder width of festival attendees in pixels and then converting it to metres. Our estimate of the crowd density is ρ = 8 ± 1 m −2.

Measurement of the velocity field

We used the same methodology for the Chupinazo and the Love Parade crowds. We measured the Eulerian velocity field in the crowd using conventional PIV. As not enough reference points are visible on the images to perform perspective correction, we used the raw images to measure the approximated velocity field. We summarize the values of the different parameters chosen to characterize the observed dynamics in Supplementary Table 1.

Power spectra

We use the same methodology as for the Chupinazo crowds.

Characterization tools

We developed all our numerical tools using mostly the numpy package of the Python numerical language.

Radial pair correlation function

We used data from the detection of the attendees (see above) and the function static.pair_correlation_2d from trackpy, which takes into account non-periodic boundary conditions. The radial pair correlation function is computed in a rectangle devoid of flags and balloons and averaged over a period of about 7 minutes in the densest crowds (see below).

### Workplace injury prevention and wellness program for orchestra musicians: a randomized controlled trial [^7dade700]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a workplace injury prevention and wellness program compared to no intervention (control) on musicians' playing-related musculoskeletal pain intensity. The hypothesis was that musicians who completed the program would have a greater reduction in pain intensity than the control group. DESIGN: Pragmatic parallel randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-five orchestra musicians were recruited and completed patient-reported outcome measures (primary outcome: pain intensity over 11 months, using the Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for Musicians; range: 0–40; lower is better) at baseline, 14 weeks (T1), and 11 months (T2). Following baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 33) or control (n = 32) groups, stratified by instrument and pain prevalence. The intervention group received a 14-week injury prevention and wellness program including education and exercise; the control group received no intervention. RESULTS: Pain intensity means (standard deviation) were 7.8 (6.2), 8.0 (7.5), and 8.6 (5.7) in the control group, and 9.0 (6.6), 5.0 (4.2), and 6.7 (6.6) in the intervention group at T0, T1, and T2, respectively. Using intention-to-treat analyses (3 dropouts, n = 65 analyzed), between-group differences in pain intensity (95% confidence interval) were T1-T0: -4.2 (-7.5, -0.9); T2-T0: -3.7 (-7.1, -0.3), type III (overall) P = 0.03, favoring the intervention group. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: A workplace injury prevention and wellness program may have a clinically meaningful effect on reducing orchestra musicians' pain intensity.

### Musical experience shapes human brainstem encoding of linguistic pitch patterns [^9ab54dbc]. Nature Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

Music and speech are very cognitively demanding auditory phenomena generally attributed to cortical rather than subcortical circuitry. We examined brainstem encoding of linguistic pitch and found that musicians show more robust and faithful encoding compared with nonmusicians. These results not only implicate a common subcortical manifestation for two presumed cortical functions, but also a possible reciprocity of corticofugal speech and music tuning, providing neurophysiological explanations for musicians' higher language-learning ability.

Ruling Out Confounds From Ethnicity: Effect of AP With Europeans Only

Although ethnicity was included in the previous analysis as a nuisance variable, one may still be concerned about the risk of confound. In order to demonstrate that the AP effect in the right PP cannot be due to the mismatch in ethnicity, we replicated the same analysis with only the European musicians (i.e. three AP Europeans vs. nine non‐AP Europeans). Because there was no Asian musician included in this subset, the ethnicity term was discarded as:

Please note that, due to the small number of samples in one group (i.e. three APs), the sensitivity of the analysis is reduced. However, if it does yield a significant result, it cannot be confounded by ethnicity. The result is shown in Figure 5. At the same level in the same location, we reproduced the AP effect (max T (8) = 10.68, P = 0.005, area = 37 mm 2 at the 50% projection level, peak MNI305‐coordinate = [45, −9, −11] mm). The effect size of AP at the peak in the right PP was 0.0171 s −1, which is very close to the effect size of AP estimated with the whole dataset (0.0169 s −1; relative error = 1.18%). If the current finding of greater myelin in the right PP had been due to confounding effect from the mismatch of ethnicity in experiment design, there should not be such a cluster without the Asian musicians. Therefore we can rule out the possibility of an ethnicity confound in the results presented in Figure 3. See Supporting Information for a simulation demonstrating the reliability of the estimation under the current design.

### A real-world multi-center RNA-seq benchmarking study using the quartet and MAQC reference materials [^35972362]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quality control check for filtering of low-quality RNA-seq data

Complete RNA-seq raw data were available in 42 laboratories. We first assessed the sequencing quality properties (pre-alignment) for the Quartet and MAQC samples, including sequencing depth, base quality, GC content, and duplication rate (Supplementary Data 3). The number of reads ranged from 39.4 Mb to 418.8 Mb for the Quartet samples and from 40.9 Mb to 424.2 Mb for the MAQC samples across laboratories (Supplementary Fig. 9). Within the same laboratory, different samples exhibited variations in sequencing depth, particularly noticeable for laboratories with higher average sequencing depths. Given that different flowcells or lanes can lead to variations in total reads counts, we compared 16 laboratories that assigned 24 libraries to two or more lanes to other laboratories that assigned libraries to a single lane, and observed no increased variations (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, inter-sample variations were considered to be due to difficulties of equimolar pooling.

Both Quartet and MAQC samples exhibited high Q30 scores, ranging from 88.4% to 96.6% and from 88.3% to 96.7%, respectively, reflecting the high quality of base calling (Supplementary Fig. 11). Most laboratories showed a biased quality score distribution in the first 1–10 bases for the Quartet and MAQC samples (Supplementary Figs. 12–13), which was attributed to lower signal intensities for the first sequencing cycle and insufficient correction for factors such as phasing and cross-talk in the initial bases during base calling. We also observed that the quality scores of forward reads (the first sequenced reads) were generally higher than those of reverse reads (the later sequenced reads), particularly in laboratories using the Illumina sequencing platform. This was attributed to the decreased cluster size and higher number of errors due to more amplification steps, and reduced DNA polymerase activity before sequencing the reverse reads.

### Incidence and relative risk of hearing disorders in professional musicians [^84b32ad8]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hearing disorders have been associated with occupational exposure to music. Musicians may benefit from non-amplified and low-intensity music, but may also have high risks of music-induced hearing loss.

Aims

To compare the incidence of hearing loss (HL) and its subentities in professional musicians with that in the general population.

Methods

We performed a historical cohort study among insurants between 19 and 66years who were employed subject to social insurance contributions. The study was conducted with data from three German statutory health insurance providers covering the years 2004–2008 with about 7 million insurants. Incidence rates with 95% CIs of HL and the subentities noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), conductive HL, sensorineural HL, conductive and sensorineural HL, as well as tinnitus were estimated stratified by age, sex and federal state. A Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate adjusted HRs and two-sided 95% CIs for HL and its subentities.

Results

More than 3 million insurants were eligible, of whom 2227 were identified as professional musicians (0.07%). During the 4-year observation period, 283,697 cases of HL were seen, 238 of them among professional musicians (0.08%), leading to an unadjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.27. The adjusted hazard ratio of musicians was 1.45 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.65) for HL and 3.61 (95% CI 1.81 to 7.20) for NIHL.

Conclusions

Professional musicians have a high risk of contracting hearing disorders. Use of already available prevention measures should reduce the incidence of HL in professional musicians.

### Music for insomnia in adults [^5daa57c2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in modern society. It causes reduced quality of life and is associated with impairments in physical and mental health. Listening to music is widely used as a sleep aid, but it remains unclear if it can actually improve insomnia in adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of listening to music on insomnia in adults and to assess the influence of specific variables that may moderate the effect.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, nine other databases and two trials registers in May 2015. In addition, we handsearched specific music therapy journals, reference lists of included studies, and contacted authors of published studies to identify additional studies eligible for inclusion, including any unpublished or ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the effects of listening to music with no treatment or treatment-as-usual on sleep improvement in adults with insomnia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened abstracts, selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all studies eligible for inclusion. Data on pre-defined outcome measures were subjected to meta-analyses when consistently reported by at least two studies. We undertook meta-analyses using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. Heterogeneity across included studies was assessed using the I² statistic.

Main Results

We included six studies comprising a total of 314 participants. The studies examined the effect of listening to pre-recorded music daily, for 25 to 60 minutes, for a period of three days to five weeks. Based on the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we judged the evidence from five studies that measured the effect of music listening on sleep quality to be of moderate quality. We judged the evidence from one study that examined other aspects of sleep (see below) to be of low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly because of limitations in design or being the only published study. As regards risk of bias, most studies were at high risk of bias on at least one domain: one study was at high risk of selection bias and one was judged to be at unclear risk; six studies were at high risk of performance bias; three studies were at high risk of detection bias; one study was at high risk of attrition bias and was study was judged to be at unclear risk; two studies were judged to be at unclear risk of reporting bias; and four studies were at high risk of other bias. Five studies (N = 264) reporting on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were included in the meta-analysis. The results of a random-effects meta-analysis revealed an effect in favour of music listening (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.42 to -2.17; Z = 8.77, P < 0.00001; moderate-quality evidence). The size of the effect indicates an increase in sleep quality of the size of about one standard deviation in favour of the intervention compared to no treatment or treatment-as-usual. Only one study (N = 50; low-quality evidence) reported data on sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep interruption, and sleep efficiency. However, It found no evidence to suggest that the intervention benefited these outcomes. None of the included studies reported any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review provide evidence that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms. The intervention is safe and easy to administer. More research is needed to establish the effect of listening to music on other aspects of sleep as well as the daytime consequences of insomnia.

### Large-scale multi-site study shows no association between musical training and early auditory neural sound encoding [^eb1772be]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Attention check

This task helped exclude participants who were not attending or who did not have properly functioning audio on their devices. To pass the attention check, participants were required to answer at least 3 of 4 trials correctly. Each trial consisted of a short sequence of 1-kHz pure tones. Each tone within a sequence was 400 ms in duration with 50-ms raised-cosine onset and offset ramps, and each tone was separated by 500 ms of silence. Participants were instructed that each trial contains between 0 and 9 tones, and their task was to report the number of tones they heard by selecting the corresponding number from a drop-down menu. Because there were 10 options for each trial, the probability of passing the screening by chance was very low (0.0037). To minimize the duration of the task, each trial only had 1, 2, 3, or 4 tones in a sequence, with each tone-sequence option presented once. Trials had a fixed duration of 5 s, so that the entire task could be completed in less than half a minute. No feedback was provided.

Melody discrimination

Stimuli were from the Melody subtest of the Full Profile of Music Perception Skills, with methods as described in Law and Zentner. During each trial, participants first heard a reference melody twice in a row, followed by a comparison melody. The task was to determine whether the comparison melody was the same as or different from the reference melody, with participants selecting their answer from five possible options: "Definitely Same", "Probably Same", "I Don't Know", "Probably Different", or "Definitely Different". One practice trial was provided, followed by 18 data trials. Participants did not receive feedback, but they did receive their total composite score at the end of the task. The composite score provided to participants was calculated using weighted responses as described in Law and Zentner, with confident correct responses ("Definitely Same" or "Definitely Different") receiving 1 point, less-confident correct responses ("Probably Same" or "Probably Different") receiving 0.5 point, and incorrect responses or "I Don't Know" receiving 0 points. For analyses, melody discrimination performance was calculated using a bias-free estimate of sensitivity, d ′ p, as recommended by Strauss et al.and Whiteford et al.

### A real-world multi-center RNA-seq benchmarking study using the quartet and MAQC reference materials [^f1656c3a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

GC content bias was found across laboratories, with the average GC content ranging from 42.3% to 54.2% for the Quartet samples and from 42.4% to 52.9% for the MAQC samples. Such laboratory-specific GC content bias, primarily caused by different sites of library preparation, was more noticeable than the sample-specific GC content bias (Supplementary Figs. 14–15). Unusual GC content presents inherent challenges, as GC-poor genes (< 35%) tended to exhibit more variable expression levels between laboratories than genes with medium or high (> 65%) GC content (Supplementary Fig. 16).

The average duplication rates of the sequencing reads varied significantly across laboratories, ranging from 4.2% to 73.4% for the Quartet samples and from 5.0% to 75.5% for the MAQC samples (Supplementary Fig. 17), with increased duplication rates correlating with higher sequencing depth (Supplementary Fig. 18a). Additionally, the mRNA enrichment method also influenced the duplication rates, with the Poly(A) selection method demonstrating higher duplication rates, similar to observations in other studies (Supplementary Fig. 18b). Noticeably, the rRNA depletion method, due to capturing a large amount of non-coding RNA, showed a significant decrease in duplication rates after removing reads aligned to non-coding regions, indicating difficulties in detecting non-coding RNAs (Supplementary Fig. 19). Seven laboratories exhibited an average duplication rate exceeding 30%, surpassing the typical duplication levels observed in prior research. These data were characterized by high duplication rates at both low and high expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 20a). Excessively duplicated reads at low expression levels were recognized to originate from PCR amplification bias. Within three of these seven laboratories, we also observed large dispersions in duplication rates for all samples, which exhibited a strong negative correlation with library concentration with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from -0.886 to -0.986, highlighting the influence of the lack of library complexity (Supplementary Fig. 20b).

### One-way dependent clusters and stability of cluster synchronization in directed networks [^539ed3a2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cluster synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators is the subject of broad interest from the scientific community, with applications ranging from neural to social and animal networks and technological systems. Most of these networks are directed, with flows of information or energy that propagate unidirectionally from given nodes to other nodes. Nevertheless, most of the work on cluster synchronization has focused on undirected networks. Here we characterize cluster synchronization in general directed networks. Our first observation is that, in directed networks, a cluster A of nodes might be one-way dependent on another cluster B: in this case, A may remain synchronized provided that B is stable, but the opposite does not hold. The main contribution of this paper is a method to transform the cluster stability problem in an irreducible form. In this way, we decompose the original problem into subproblems of the lowest dimension, which allows us to immediately detect inter-dependencies among clusters. We apply our analysis to two examples of interest, a human network of violin players executing a musical piece for which directed interactions may be either activated or deactivated by the musicians, and a multilayer neural network with directed layer-to-layer connections.

### Music therapy for autistic people [^e65146b3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Social interaction and social communication are among the central areas of difficulty for autistic people. Music therapy uses music experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of autistic people. Music therapy has been applied in autism since the early 1950s, but its availability to autistic individuals varies across countries and settings. The application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training which enables therapists to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of the individual. The present version of this review on music therapy for autistic people is an update of the previous Cochrane review update published in 2014 (following the original Cochrane review published in 2006).

Objectives

To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, for autistic people.

Search Methods

In August 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eleven other databases and two trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy (or music therapy alongside standard care) to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for people with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Four authors independently selected studies and extracted data from all included studies. We synthesised the results of included studies in meta-analyses. Four authors independently assessed risk of bias (RoB) of each included study using the original RoB tool as well as the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 new studies in this update which brought the total number of included studies to 26 (1165 participants). These studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy (intervention duration: three days to eight months) for autistic people in individual or group settings. More than half of the studies were conducted in North America or Asia. Twenty-one studies included children aged from two to 12 years. Five studies included children and adolescents, and/or young adults. Severity levels, language skills, and cognition were widely variable across studies. Measured immediately post-intervention, music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care was more likely to positively effect global improvement (risk ratio (RR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.40; 8 studies, 583 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 11 for low-risk population, 95% CI 6 to 39; NNTB = 6 for high-risk population, 95% CI 3 to 21) and to slightly increase quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49; 3 RCTs, 340 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, small to medium effect size). In addition, music therapy probably results in a large reduction in total autism symptom severity (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.24; 9 studies, 575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No clear evidence of a difference between music therapy and comparison groups at immediately post-intervention was found for social interaction (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.57, 12 studies, 603 participants; low-certainty evidence); non-verbal communication (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.55; 7 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence); and verbal communication (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.78; 8 studies, 276 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies investigated adverse events with one (36 participants) reporting no adverse events; the other study found no differences between music therapy and standard care immediately post-intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.94; 1 study, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy is probably associated with an increased chance of global improvement for autistic people, likely helps them to improve total autism severity and quality of life, and probably does not increase adverse events immediately after the intervention. The certainty of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for these four outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. No clear evidence of a difference was found for social interaction, non-verbal communication, and verbal communication measured immediately post-intervention. For these outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low' or 'very low', meaning that the true effect may be substantially different from these results. Compared with earlier versions of this review, the new studies included in this update helped to increase the certainty and applicability of this review's findings through larger sample sizes, extended age groups, longer periods of intervention and inclusion of follow-up assessments, and by predominantly using validated scales measuring generalised behaviour (i.e. behaviour outside of the therapy context). This new evidence is important for autistic individuals and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around the types and amount of intervention that should be provided and in the planning of resources. The applicability of the findings is still limited to the age groups included in the studies, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about music therapy in autistic individuals above the young adult age. More research using rigorous designs, relevant outcome measures, and longer-term follow-up periods is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.

2.3 Selection of Music Compositions

Our evaluation involved five different types of music, each represented by a group of compositions: movie soundtrack, relaxation music, minimalistic music, rapid and dynamic music, and Mozart's music. A professional musician selected one original composition per group, and each was acoustically compared with the others using acoustic parameters identified as important in our previous study. For the selection of compositions see Table 1; for the complete procedure for selecting compositions based on acoustic analysis and the acoustic properties of the selected compositions, please refer to the Supporting Information. The compositions were 5–5.5 min in length.

TABLE 1
Compositions.

For each group, four additional compositions were chosen based on acoustic similarity to or difference from the original composition (the most IED‐reducing composition from the first day): the most similar composition from the same group (sSG), the most similar composition from all compositions outside the group (sOG), the most contrasting composition from the same group (cSG), and the most contrasting composition from all groups (cOG).

2.4 Statistical Analysis

The number of IEDs and changes between the premusic and postmusic resting states were summarized as medians. Absolute and relative changes were calculated; relative changes were calculated as absolute changes divided by the number of IEDs in the premusic resting state. The effects of listening to compositions were compared using a paired‐sample Wilcoxon test. The changes in IEDs between men and women were evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test. The effects on IEDs of the acoustic properties of the compositions that were listened to on the first day were analyzed based on Pearson correlation coefficients. The coefficients were calculated between musical features and median numbers of IEDs in the selected parts (equally long sections of the compositions within the first 5 min from the start).

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Jornay pm) [^708edd02]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with JORNAY PM, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of JORNAY PM in patients 6 years and older is 20 mg once daily orally in the evening. Do not take JORNAY PM in the morning. The dose may be titrated weekly in increments of 20 mg. A daily dosage above 100 mg has not been studied and is not recommended.

Initiate dosing at 8:00 p.m. Adjust the timing of administration between 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. to optimize the tolerability and efficacy the next morning and throughout the day. In clinical trials of patients aged 6 to 12 years, the most common dosing time (> 70% of patients) was 8:00 p.m., with an allowed range between 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Following determination of the optimal administration time, advise patients to maintain a consistent dosing time.

Advise patients to take JORNAY PM consistently, either with food or without food.

Patients who miss their dose of JORNAY PM at the regularly scheduled time should take it as soon as they remember that same evening. If a patient remembers the missed dose the following morning, they should skip the missed dose and wait until their next scheduled evening administration.

2.3 Administration Instructions

JORNAY PM may be taken whole, or the capsule may be opened, and the entire contents sprinkled onto applesauce. If the patient is using the sprinkled administration method, the sprinkled applesauce should be consumed immediately; it should not be stored. Patients should take the applesauce with sprinkled beads in its entirety without chewing. The dose of a single capsule should not be divided. The contents of the entire capsule should be taken at the same time.
