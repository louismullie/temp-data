## Question

PCOS and pelvic ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how pelvic ultrasound fits into PCOS diagnosis and management across ages, including when it is needed, what thresholds to apply, and how to integrate AMH and endometrial assessment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic framework and the principle of avoiding unnecessary testing. Then, I should verify adult diagnostic pathways and the updated ultrasound/AMH thresholds. Next, I will examine adolescent-specific restrictions and the rationale for deferring ultrasound. After that, I need to check the role of ultrasound in infertility workups and ovulation induction. Finally, I will consider endometrial assessment, special populations, and practical implementation with quality assurance and shared decision-making, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation so I don't jump to conclusions: PCOS remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion requiring two of three features — hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology — after ruling out mimics, and importantly, if both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound or AMH is not required to make the diagnosis, which avoids unnecessary imaging and reduces overdiagnosis [^114NTN9g] [^111T6jk3] [^113bZato].

> Wait, let me verify the adult ultrasound thresholds because older cutoffs can mislead. The 2023 guideline specifies that follicle number per ovary (FNPO) ≥ 20 in at least one ovary is the preferred marker for PCOM, with ovarian volume ≥ 10 mL or follicle number per section ≥ 10 as acceptable alternatives when image quality or older technology limits FNPO determination, and these thresholds should be interpreted in the context of cycle day and technique, with transvaginal ultrasound preferred when acceptable for accuracy [^111bmTa8] [^113DMyBG].

> Hold on, I should verify the AMH alternative before substituting it indiscriminately. Serum AMH can now be used in place of ultrasound to define PCOM in adults, but it is not a standalone diagnostic test for PCOS, and both AMH and ultrasound should not be ordered together to avoid redundancy, with awareness that AMH varies by age, BMI, assay, and COCP use, so population- and assay-specific cutoffs are needed and evidence remains low to moderate quality [^113NN1jM] [^114NTN9g].

> I need to ensure adolescent-specific guidance is precise: in those less than 8 years post-menarche, ultrasound is not recommended for diagnosis because multifollicular ovaries are common and specificity is poor, and AMH is likewise not recommended in adolescents. Diagnosis requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction after excluding other causes, and if only one feature is present, clinicians should label the patient as "at risk" and plan reassessment rather than overdiagnose [^111T6jk3] [^114ASWyp] [^114HkjwM].

> Let me consider the infertility pathway so I don't miss where ultrasound becomes essential. Baseline infertility evaluation includes pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian morphology and endometrium, and during ovulation induction — particularly with gonadotropins — serial transvaginal ultrasound is required to monitor follicular development and mitigate OHSS and multiple pregnancy risks, with low-dose step-up protocols and careful titration per guideline [^1166Mcnz] [^115hCB4p] [^1164E4zM].

> I should double-check endometrial assessment because this is often overlooked. Routine endometrial thickness screening is not recommended, but in women with prolonged amenorrhea or abnormal bleeding, or when endometrial thickness is excessive, transvaginal ultrasound and, if indicated, endometrial sampling should be considered, with counseling on risk factors and prevention of endometrial hyperplasia including weight management and progestogen therapy [^117NEPPn] [^114vCQYS].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases? In perimenopausal or menopausal patients with a well-documented history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, a presumptive PCOS diagnosis may be reasonable, and ultrasound may show reduced or absent PCOM, whereas new-onset severe hyperandrogenism warrants evaluation for androgen-secreting tumors, and across ethnic groups PCOS prevalence and phenotypes vary, so thresholds and counseling should be culturally sensitive [^117JSkYs] [^113rE3kX] [^114VJRpy].

> Next, I should review implementation details to avoid misclassification. Standardized ultrasound protocols should document cycle day, transducer frequency, approach, FNPO or FNPS, ovarian volume, and uterine features, and operators should exclude follicles ≥ 10 mm from counts and calculations, with training and quality assurance emphasized because operator and equipment variability can bias results and mislabel PCOM [^111bmTa8] [^115Kn6gR].

> Hold on, let's not jump past shared decision-making. Patients should be counseled that ultrasound is not always necessary, that AMH is an acceptable alternative in adults, and that in adolescents ultrasound is deferred to avoid overdiagnosis, aligning choices with preferences, access, and cost, and using evidence-based communication frameworks to explain uncertainty and trade-offs [^1123WD1C] [^114NTN9g].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach so it's actionable: if an adult has both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism, diagnose PCOS and skip ultrasound. If only one feature is present, obtain ultrasound or AMH to complete two of three, using FNPO ≥ 20 as the primary threshold and documenting technique and cycle timing. If an adolescent has both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, diagnose PCOS without imaging, and if only one feature is present, defer diagnosis, avoid ultrasound, and plan reassessment. In infertility, include baseline ultrasound and use serial monitoring for ovulation induction, while reserving endometrial assessment for abnormal bleeding or prolonged amenorrhea [^113bZato] [^111T6jk3] [^1166Mcnz] [^117NEPPn].

Pelvic ultrasound is **not required** for PCOS diagnosis when both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are present [^114NTN9g]; it is used to document polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) when only one feature is present or to exclude other pathology [^113bZato]. In adolescents, ultrasound is **not recommended** due to poor specificity and overlap with normal pubertal physiology [^111T6jk3] [^114ASWyp]. The 2023 guideline defines adult PCOM as **≥ 20 follicles 2–9 mm in at least one ovary** or **ovarian volume ≥ 10 mL** [^111bmTa8]; AMH can substitute for ultrasound in adults, but not in adolescents [^113NN1jM]. Ultrasound is operator- and equipment-dependent, so standardized protocols and training are essential [^111bmTa8] [^115Kn6gR].

---

## Role of pelvic ultrasound in PCOS diagnosis

Pelvic ultrasound is a **key tool** for assessing PCOM, one of the three diagnostic features of PCOS [^114NTN9g]. According to the 2023 international guideline, PCOM is defined in adults as either **≥ 20 follicles 2–9 mm in at least one ovary** or an **ovarian volume ≥ 10 mL** [^111bmTa8]. Ultrasound is most useful when only one of the other two criteria (hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction) is present, helping to confirm the diagnosis [^113bZato].

---

## Indications for pelvic ultrasound in PCOS

Ultrasound is **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Single feature present**: When only hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction is present, ultrasound helps document PCOM [^113bZato].
- **Exclusion of other pathology**: Ultrasound can identify other pelvic or uterine abnormalities that may mimic or coexist with PCOS [^115Kn6gR].
- **Infertility evaluation**: Ultrasound is part of baseline infertility workup to assess ovarian morphology and endometrial thickness [^1166Mcnz].

---

## Limitations and challenges of pelvic ultrasound

Despite its utility, ultrasound has several **limitations**:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with operator skill and experience [^115Kn6gR].
- **Equipment variability**: Differences in ultrasound machines and settings can affect image quality and interpretation [^115Kn6gR].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, bowel gas, and patient discomfort can limit image quality, especially in adolescents [^1167MVX1].
- **False positives**: Polycystic-appearing ovaries can be seen in healthy women, leading to potential overdiagnosis [^114nHqa1].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

Recent guidelines introduce **anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)** as an alternative to ultrasound for documenting PCOM in adults [^113NN1jM]. AMH reflects ovarian follicle count and correlates with PCOM; however, it is not recommended for adolescents due to limited evidence and potential for overdiagnosis [^113NN1jM].

---

## Specific considerations for adolescents

Adolescents require a **cautious approach** because normal pubertal physiology often mimics PCOS features [^114ASWyp]. Ultrasound is **not recommended** for adolescents due to poor specificity and overlap with normal ovarian morphology [^114ASWyp]. Diagnosis in adolescents should rely on clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, with ultrasound reserved for specific clinical indications [^111TsYSD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The 2023 international guideline provides clear recommendations on the use of ultrasound in PCOS:

- **Adults**: Ultrasound or AMH can be used to document PCOM when only one other diagnostic feature is present [^114NTN9g].
- **Adolescents**: Ultrasound is not recommended for routine diagnosis; diagnosis should be based on clinical and biochemical criteria [^111T6jk3].
- **Standardization**: Standardized protocols and training are recommended to improve accuracy and consistency [^111bmTa8].

---

## Summary of key points

| **Aspect** | **Adults** | **Adolescents** |
|-|-|-|
| Role of ultrasound | Document PCOM when only one other feature is present | Not recommended for routine diagnosis |
| Alternative method | AMH can substitute for ultrasound | Not recommended |
| Limitations | Operator dependence, equipment variability, false positives | Poor specificity, overlap with normal physiology |
| Clinical guidelines | Use ultrasound or AMH when needed | Rely on clinical and biochemical criteria |

---

Pelvic ultrasound is a **valuable tool** for documenting PCOM in PCOS, particularly when only one other diagnostic feature is present [^113bZato]. It is not required when both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are present and is not recommended for routine diagnosis in adolescents [^114NTN9g] [^111T6jk3]. AMH is an acceptable alternative in adults, and standardized protocols are essential for accurate interpretation [^113NN1jM] [^111bmTa8].

Polycystic ovary syndrome remains a diagnostic challenge because there is no single defining test. The clinical presentation must dictate the extent of the work-up. The typical PCOS patient has a history of irregular menses and appears hirsute. Demonstration of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism can also be made by appropriate hormonal measurements. An ultrasound showing multiple small ovarian follicles can support a diagnosis of PCOS in the patient for whom the clinical diagnosis has been made. Other causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction should be excluded.

### Is ultrasound useful in the diagnosis of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome? [^111y4vBG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains a challenge despite several existing criteria, and may be difficult to distinguish from pubertal changes. Different parameters to study ovarian function using ultrasonography have been proposed, but there is still no consensus about their diagnostic value.

Objective

To evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of adolescent PCOS by reviewing available studies that assessed the ovarian volume (OV) and other ovarian morphological features such as location and number of follicles, stromal area, and volume.

Methods

MEDLINE/PubMed database were searched to identify studies that assessed ovarian characteristics of adolescent PCOS patients by ultrasound. Studies on adults were also reviewed if study population included adolescents and stromal characteristics were assessed by three-dimensional (3D) sonogram.

Results

Five studies, including 262 PCOS adolescents (10–19 years of age) and two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound analysis, were identified. Mean OV was 9.29 cm³ for PCOS patients and 4.77 cm³ for controls. The morphology of ovarian follicles, when reported, showed multiple (> 10) peripheral follicles in 83% of cases. Two studies, including 157 PCOS adolescents and young women (15–35 years of age) and 2D and 3D ultrasound analysis, were identified. Patients with PCOS patients had a MOV 13.1 cm³, multiple follicles (> 15), and a statistically significant greater S/A ratio compared to controls. Stromal volume indices were positively correlated with hyperandrogenemia in PCOS patients.

Conclusion

Pelvic ultrasound is an increasingly important aid in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. Besides ovarian volume, ovarian morphology must be assessed with 2D ultrasound to look for peripherally located multiple follicles. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of 3D ultrasonographic assessment in adolescents with PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — when prescribing gonadotrophins, the following should be considered: cost of the intervention for ovulation induction, expertise required for the use of the intervention for ovulation induction, the degree of intensive ultrasound monitoring that is required, and implications of potential multiple pregnancy; additionally, a low dose step-up gonadotrophin protocol should be used to optimize the chance of monofollicular development, and there appears to be no difference in the clinical efficacy of the available gonadotrophin preparations.

1 INTRODUCTION

OPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged women. According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS in adults is diagnosed based on a minimum of two of the following: oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology on ultrasound, after ruling out differential diagnoses. These criteria result in four phenotypes of PCOS including phenotype A with oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology; phenotype B with oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism; phenotype C with hyperandrogenism and PCO morphology; and phenotype D with oligo/anovulation and PCO morphology. PCOS is associated with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features. Aetiology is complex including genetic, in‐utero, potential epigenetic factors, exacerbated by adverse lifestyle and excess adiposity. Hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and resulting hyperinsulinemia are common underpinnings in PCOS.

PCOS and excess adiposity have a bidirectional relationship with excess weight exacerbating the underpinning hormonal imbalance and PCOS itself appearing to predispose to excess weight and weight gain. The prevalence of PCOS in women with obesity is up to 37%. Women with PCOS may also be more likely to gain weight longitudinallyand at a greater pace. This may be attributable to impairments in appetite‐regulating hormones and hyperinsulinemia.and a more sedentary lifestyle.and may be inter‐related to the psychological features of PCOS such as anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life. Obesity further exacerbates hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia and plays a key independent role in increasing cardiometabolic risks in women with PCOS.

Women with PCOS commonly have oligo/anovulation, with or without irregular menstrual cycles, with PCOS the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. Infertility and a longer time to pregnancy may confer a higher risk for pregnancy and birth complications. Additionally, the type and intensity of treatment used to manage infertility, may further complicate pregnancy and birth independent of multiple pregnancies. Infertility is exacerbated by obesity.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^112emvAz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

Majority of CPGs focused on the different treatments of PCOS (10/13, 77%), risk assessment (10/13, 77%), and only 9 made recommendations on the diagnosis of PCOS (9/13, 69%).

Diagnosis of PCOS

For the diagnosis of PCOS in adults, 7 CPGs supported the use of the Rotterdam criteria or its modification, although only 1 provided a clear definition for of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in adults. Only 4 CPGs recommended systematic examination and assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism with only 1 guideline recommending the use of specific standardized assessment tools (Ferriman Gallwey score and the Ludwig visual score) for hirsutism and acne in adults. All relevant CPGs supported the use of testosterone (total or free) or the free androgen index (calculated as the ratio is the level of total testosterone divided by the level of sex hormone-binding globulin and multiplied by 100) to diagnose hyperandrogenemia, although there were variations on the value of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate as routine blood tests to diagnose PCOS. Anti-Müllerian hormone was recommended as useful for diagnosing PCOS in 1 guideline while the international PCOS guideline did not recommend its use.

Two CPGs were particularly focused on the diagnosis and management of PCOS in adolescents, and 5 generated recommendations on both adolescent and adult women with PCOS. All relevant CPGs recommended against the use of PCOM as an independent ultrasonic diagnostic feature in adolescents emphasizing the limited value of ultrasound scanning in this population. Only 2 CPGs made clear recommendations on the definitions for oligo and amenorrhea in adolescents as part of the PCOS diagnostic criteria. There were variations in the recommendations made on the value of different biochemical tests to diagnose hyperandrogenemia although all included CPGs recommended against the use of anti-Müllerian hormone.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^1111HKxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

### Diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^112zCDZE]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female reproductive disorder that often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life. Prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health management. This article incorporates the most recent evidence and consensus guidelines to provide an updated review of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management strategies for adolescents with this complex condition. We will review the recent international guidelines on PCOS; because the diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, management of this condition is inconsistent. In 2019, PCOS remains a common, yet neglected, condition, in part, because of the lack of agreement around both diagnosis and management.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^112Mm9gy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments to implement the practice of evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs recommendations on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. We extracted data in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains and assessed CPGs methodological quality of using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

Evidence Synthesis

We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. CPGs recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs had a high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%) while stakeholder's involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). We identified inconsistency in recommendations on PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, hirsutism and acne treatments, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

Conclusion

Current CPGs on the diagnosis and management of PCOS vary in their scope and methodological quality, which may hinder evidence translation into clinical practice. We identified disease domains with existing evidence gap to guide future research and guideline updates.

### Adolescent female with suspected PCOS [^111TsYSD]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Adolescent female with suspected polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes assessing hyperandrogenemia when acne is persistent and unresponsive to therapy, using serum total and/or free testosterone as the best indicator and performing testing in a laboratory that can accurately measure lower levels; free testosterone is described as more sensitive than total testosterone in detecting hyperandrogenemia. Menstrual criteria supporting evaluation include menstrual intervals persistently shorter than 20 days or greater than 45 days in individuals 2 or more years after menarche, consecutive menstrual periods > 90 days apart, and lack of onset of menses by age 15 years or by more than 2–3 years after thelarche. Pelvic ultrasound can be generally deferred during diagnostic evaluation unless anatomic evaluation or clinical suspicion for tumor exists and is best deferred till after evaluation by Endocrinologist. Obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance should not be used as diagnostic criteria but as clues to investigate for PCOS, and timely diagnosis should be based on robust clinical and biochemical criteria to avoid over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.

### New diagnostic option for polycystic ovarian syndrome… [^116kBjNb]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Lilian White, MD Posted on December 2, 2024 Polycystic ovarian syndrome is estimated to affect approximately 10% of women of reproductive age worldwide. PCOS tends to be underdiagnosed and is a leading cause of infertility. Patients with PCOS are more likely to develop hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and endometrial cancer, making diagnosis and early intervention potentially impactful on a patient's long-term health. PCOS also increases the risk of miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and cesarean delivery. PCOS is a syndromic diagnosis, and there are no specific criteria that diagnose it unequivocally. Previously, guidelines have favored the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS. In adults, meeting at least two of the three Rotterdam criteria supports a diagnosis of PCOS.

An updated international guideline by the PCOS Network adds the new diagnostic option of elevated antimüllerian hormone levels in place of an ultrasonography showing polycystic ovaries to diagnose PCOS. AMH is solely secreted from ovarian follicles. This blood test is less invasive, more accessible, and less expensive than ultrasonography. The etiology of elevated AMH in PCOS appears to be multifactorial and is incompletely understood. Genetics appear to play a role, with some studies implicating polymorphisms associated with AMH. Production of AMH also appears to be higher in the ovaries of women with PCOS. AMH varies with age, body mass index, and laboratory results, so there is not yet a standardized threshold for diagnosis. An AMH cutoff value of 3. 8 ng/mL when used in place of ultrasound criteria was estimated to be > 80% sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PCOS in one study.

AMH levels are also useful in the assessment of ovarian reserve, such as for the evaluation of infertility.

Summary

Study Question:

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer:

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What is Known Already:

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration:

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods:

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and the Role of Chance:

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons for Caution:

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications of the Findings:

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^114HkjwM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Adolescents 'at risk' of PCOS

A practice point for this section is that, for adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria, the 'at risk' of PCOS label could be considered and reassessment is advised at or before full reproductive maturity. This timing is at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual cycle irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to identify a polycystic ovarian morphology, as described in the ultrasound section. The timing of reassessment in relation to menstrual cycles was based on physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis and the likelihood of having ovulatory cycles matching those of women in reproductive age. Reassessment is particularly important for adolescent girls with persisting PCOS features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence and should occur after hormonal therapy washout of at least 3 months if this therapy has been commenced (whilst ensuring contraceptive needs are met). This recommendation is based on the need to address isolated symptoms, such as irregular menstrual cycles or clinical hyperandrogenism, where the diagnosis of PCOS remains unclear as pelvic ultrasound is not recommended at this life stage. PCOS cannot be diagnosed during adolescence unless both irregular menstrual cycles or hyperandrogenism are present. It was recommended that these adolescents be made aware of their 'at risk' status for PCOS and that future re-evaluation may be needed if both features persist beyond 3 years post menarche. This recommendation emerged from published evidence as well as from strong and consistent feedback from women with PCOS, who had a poor diagnostic experience and often failed to be diagnosed during adolescence, remaining unaware of this potential diagnosis until seeking treatment for infertility (see Section 1.1 in the Technical Report). Adult physicians and reproductive endocrinologists also expressed significant concern over delayed diagnosis. All GDGs highlighted the need to acknowledge 'risk' yet avoid over-diagnosis or premature labelling. Another practice point for this section is that, in adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles and 'at risk', the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the adolescent and their families, considering all diagnostic challenges at this life stage as well as psychosocial and cultural factors.

Discussion

The Guideline recommendations are the result of extensive international engagement and rigorous, evidence-based processes aligned with international best practice. Whilst the Guideline provided recommendations for adult women and adolescents, this paper summarises the evidence and recommendations relating to adolescents as defined by the World Health Organisation, namely as females aged between 10 and 19 years. It also addresses recommendations relating to gynaecological age, and specifically 8 years post menarche, and the use of pelvic ultrasound in PCOS diagnosis as well as recommendations relating to the re-evaluation of girls that do not meet the diagnostic criteria in adolescence but are considered 'at increased risk' of PCOS. There are few evidence-based recommendations relating to adolescents in the Guideline highlighting the limited evidence in this age group. Limitations within studies included poorly defined study populations, challenges in diagnosis around puberty, the different diagnostic criteria used and lack of availability of data for "time post menarche" of subjects included in most of the studies. Research recommendations highlighted these gaps and emphasised the need for greater high-quality research of PCOS during adolescence.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1123WD1C]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — patient care and shared decision-making emphasizes that healthcare professionals should employ shared decision-making and support patient agency or ability to take independent actions to manage their health and care, and the importance of being knowledgeable about PCOS, of applying evidence-based practices when sharing news on diagnosis, treatment, and health implications, and of ascertaining and focusing on patient priorities, should be recognized. Healthcare system leaders should enable system wide changes that support healthcare professional training, knowledge and practice in sharing news optimally, shared decision making and patient agency, including ensuring adequate consultation time and accessible resources. Evidence-based strategies for shared decision making and for sharing news (such as the SPIKES framework) are readily available and should be used to inform PCOS care, all healthcare professionals partnering with women with PCOS should be knowledgeable in sharing news, in shared decision-making, and in supporting patient self-management, and evidence-based strategies and resources can be used to support patient activation, which refers to modifiable knowledge, skills, ability, confidence, and willingness to self-manage one's own health and care.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: definition, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^113vkmcG]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in premenopausal women. Heterogeneous by nature, PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. The aetiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that PCOS might be a complex multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders. This article aims to provide a balanced review of the latest advances and current limitations in our knowledge about PCOS while also providing a few clear and simple principles, based on current evidence-based clinical guidelines, for the proper diagnosis and long-term clinical management of women with PCOS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117MaXiA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective:

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants:

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence:

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process:

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions:

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — postmenopause diagnosis and evaluation states that a diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring / lifelong, and healthcare professionals could consider that both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS; PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis, or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the earlier reproductive years (age 20–40), and further investigations should be considered to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^115SW6z2]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition affecting between 8 and 13% of women of reproductive age and 6–18% of adolescent girls depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. Adolescence, as defined by the World Health Organisation, is the period between 10 and 19 years of age that includes significant and critical changes in growth, development and puberty.

Diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence is both controversial and challenging due to the overlap of normal pubertal physiological changes (irregular menstrual cycles, acne and polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasound) with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria. These challenges have been acknowledged in adult and paediatric consensus statements. Specifically, challenges include the risk of under-diagnosis, delayed and/or poor diagnosis experiences, and over-diagnosis as well as the additional risk of the use of inconsistent non-evidence-based approaches in the diagnosis and management of PCOS among specialists, general practitioners and allied health professionals. These challenges are exacerbated by the lack of robust evidence. For example, 'only adolescents' studies are limited and suboptimal in quality. Further, adult studies that include adolescents do not specify the number of adolescents or time post menarche, which is critical information to determine the evolution of normal pubertal physiological changes. Lastly, relevant consensus statements are often not specific to adolescents and/or not based on robust high-level evidence and/or rigorous processes, indicating the need for high quality, evidence-based guidelines.

The aim of the first International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS ('the Guideline') was to promote the accurate diagnosis of PCOS, optimal consistent care, the prevention of complications and improved patient health outcomes from adolescence to adulthood. The term 'adolescence' in the Guideline was defined as the period between 10 and 19 years of age according to the World Health Organisation. However, based on evidence, those who were within a gynaecological age of 8 years or less than 8 years post menarche were also identified in the recommendations.

This paper focuses specifically on the adolescent recommendations from the Guideline and examines the evidence and rationale supporting these recommendations. We discuss the importance of avoiding missed diagnosis, of delayed, under- or over-diagnosis, and of evidence-based management to address PCOS symptoms in adolescents. Additionally, we expand on approaches to identify girls 'at risk' of PCOS but not yet diagnosed, including the need for future follow-up.

2 | INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. – Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, – resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to upskill health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Update on diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome during adolescence [^115b4Dtq]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic condition beginning during the peripubertal years. The international evidence-based guidelines and the update in 2023 have clearly defined the diagnostic criteria during adolescence with the goal of decreasing controversies and challenges with the diagnosis during this critical life stage. In this narrative review we aimed to examine the recent available data related to the diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Specifically, we evaluated publications from August 2022 (date when the last searches were run for the update of the international evidence-based guidelines on PCOS) to May 2025. Current evidence supports the use of two main diagnostic criteria for adolescents: irregular menstrual cycles, well defined according to time post-menarche, and hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, after excluding other conditions that mimic PCOS. In contrast to adult PCOS diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology on pelvic ultrasound and/or antimullerian hormone levels should not be used for adolescent PCOS diagnosis. Accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence enables early screening and management of PCOS and its associated comorbidities. Equally important is the early identification of adolescents considered "at risk" of PCOS (those who only meet one diagnostic criterion) as emerging evidence indicated increased metabolic risks and reinforces the need for long-term follow-up. Novel cluster analysis in well-defined adolescent cohorts is beginning to clarify threshold values for diagnostic features and may further refine adolescent-specific criteria. Specific PCOS diagnostic criteria avoiding polycystic ovary morphology and antimullerian hormone; and using of clearly defined irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism should be applied during adolescence. Early recognition of adolescents both with PCOS and those "at risk" is critical to ensure timely metabolic screening and appropriate follow-up. Health care professionals should be aware that different PCOS diagnostic criteria are necessary for adolescents.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects approximately 10–20% of women of reproductive age. There are various diagnostic criteria for PCOS including the Rotterdam 2003 criteria, Androgen Excess Society criteria and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria 1990; however, the international evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS have advocated the use of the Rotterdam 2003 diagnostic criteria. – According to the Rotterdam criteria, to diagnose a woman with PCOS, she must have at least two out of the following three clinical and biochemical features: clinical and biochemical androgen excess, anovulation/oligo-ovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology verified by ultrasound.PCOS is also associated with a wide range of comorbidities including infertility, metabolic syndrome, increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obesity, eating disorders, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidaemia, mood swings and hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, women with PCOS are also at increased risk of miscarriages, premature birth, gestational diabetes, and high blood pressure. –

Diagnosis

The controversies of diagnosing adolescents with PCOS are compounded by a reliance on 95th centiles cut-off points for menstrual cycles or hirsutism, which are not diagnostic of pathology and are derived from highly variable populations and relatively poor-quality data. Additionally, there is a lack of available outcome data on the long-term health impact of PCOS in conditions such as diabetes. Moving forward, there is a need for greater research into how the confluence of diagnostic factors can be separated out to establish a clear clinical syndrome and how these factors predict short- and long-term adverse health outcomes, with studies in this area now underway.

Diagnosis relied on strong consensus recommendations and aimed to avoid delayed, under- or over-diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. The criteria included a clear definition of irregular menstrual cycles according to time post menarche and clinical hyperandrogenism, including severe acne and hirsutism and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, after exclusion of other conditions that mimic PCOS. The use of pelvic ultrasound for diagnosis in females less than 8 years post menarche should be avoided due to the overlap with normal pubertal physiology, the lack of specificity of polycystic ovarian morphology for PCOS diagnosis in this age group and the avoidance of transvaginal ultrasound in those not yet sexually active. AMH was not recommended for a diagnosis of PCOS due to a lack of evidence and apparent lack of specificity. Additionally, special considerations need to be given when assessing adolescents for PCOS; importantly, adolescents' and their family's preferences and cultural norms should be included in decision-making.

The Guideline recommends recognising adolescents 'at risk'. The potential for over-diagnosis is minimised by the narrowed diagnostic criteria; however, there is also respectful recognition of the need to avoid delayed and missed diagnosis and a poor diagnosis experience. As such, reassessment is recommended at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to review the polycystic ovarian morphology. This approach recognises a group of adolescents with only one symptom cluster as 'at risk' of PCOS, enabling a focus on symptom management whilst avoiding premature labelling and recommending subsequent follow-up.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome underdiagnosis patterns by individual-level and spatial social vulnerability measures [^112KXmNj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinology among reproductive-aged women, contributes a significant economic and health burden through its effects on reproductive, metabolic, and psychosocial health. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated to be between 6% and 12% in the United States. In 2020 alone, PCOS was associated with healthcare costs of ∼$8 billion in the United States. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in reproductive-aged women, and women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, throughout their life course.

Despite potential serious implications, many women who meet diagnostic criteria for PCOS remain undiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis. The Rotterdam Criteria for diagnosis, established in 2003, requires 2 out of the 3 cardinal features of PCOS: irregular menstruation, symptoms of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism) or lab tests for biochemical androgen excess, and the presence of ovarian cysts on transvaginal ultrasound. According to current guidelines, if a provider suspects a patient has PCOS, they will inquire about relevant symptoms including menstrual cycle irregularity, hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss, and weight gain. If PCOS is suspected but not confirmed symptomatically, after ruling out other endocrinopathies that present with similar symptoms, a provider may order a test for biochemical hyperandrogenemia or a pelvic ultrasound to check for polycystic ovarian morphology to confirm diagnosis. After receiving a PCOS diagnosis, a patient ideally receives access to counseling around menstrual and uterine health, information about potential comorbidities and prevention strategies, and tailored fertility care during periods of attempted conception.

### G-trust scorecard… [^1143yTHM]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- PCOS can be diagnosed without using ultrasonography in women with ovulatory dysfunction and clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism.
- In adults, antimüllerian hormone levels can be used instead of ultrasonography to indicate polycystic ovaries.
- Consider treating hirsutism and irregular cycles with a combined oral contraceptive. Limit metformin use to patients with obesity and metabolic risk factors. From the AFP Editors Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive-aged women, affecting up to 13% of this population. An international group of professional organizations has developed an evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS. DIAGNOSIS To diagnose PCOS, two of the following criteria are required: clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, ultrasound images showing polycystic ovaries or elevated antimüllerian hormone levels.

Hyperandrogenism At least 60% of women with PCOS have evidence of hyperandrogenism using clinical or biochemical markers. To diagnose clinical hyperandrogenism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score is recommended to assess facial and terminal hair growth, although presentations differ among ethnicities.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NTN9g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^115Kn6gR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Determining FNPO is highly operator- and equipment-dependent, which affects its accuracy and reproducibility. Moreover, advances in equipment increase sensitivity and in turn FNPO cutoffs. However, ultrasound involves expensive equipment and trained personnel, leading to increased costs and impacts on accessibility. The route of the ultrasound to assess FNPO, whether transvaginal route or the transabdominal route, has impacts on accuracy. Lastly, in some women transvaginal ultrasound is unacceptable or may be perceived as invasive. Altogether these factors collectively limit the use, accuracy, and availability of ultrasound for the diagnosis of PCOM.

The presence of PCOM can now be inferred from elevated circulating level of AMH, although the exact diagnostic levels will vary by population and laboratory. A pelvic ultrasound has the advantage of detecting other abnormalities, including possible endometrial hyperplasia, and other pelvic pathology. Of note, the detection of PCOM, either ultrasound or AMH, should not be used for the evaluation of adolescents less than 8 years gynecological age with suspected PCOS.

### Abstract… [^116BWun8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

How Does PCOS Present. Patients with PCOS may be asymptomatic, or they may have multiple metabolic, dermatologic, or gynecologic manifestations. Patients often present with signs of hyperandrogenism, irregular menses, or infertility. 3, 4 PCOS may be suspected after the incidental discovery of multiple ovarian cysts on ultrasonography, although most patients with incidentally detected polycystic ovaries on imaging do not have PCOS. What Is the Recommended Diagnostic Evaluation. A clinical diagnosis of PCOS can generally be made with a history, a physical examination, and basic laboratory testing. There is no single diagnostic test for PCOS. Instead, clinical criteria are used, most commonly the 2003 Rotterdam criteria.

4, 11–14 After disorders with overlapping features have been excluded, the diagnosis of PCOS in adults requires the presence of at least two of the three Rotterdam criteria: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. How Is PCOS Diagnosed in Adolescents. Because the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS in adults overlap with normal pubertal physiologic changes, the diagnosis in adolescents requires the presence of both oligoanovulation and hyperandrogenism for at least two years postmenarche. 4, 11 Ultrasound findings are not recommended as a diagnostic criterion in adolescents because polycystic ovaries can be a part of normal ovarian morphology in this age group. The International PCOS Network recommends waiting until at least eight years after menarche to consider ultrasound findings in the diagnosis of PCOS.
4.

Although individuals with PCOS have at least a twofold increased risk of endometrial cancer compared with the general population, the absolute risk is relatively low. 23 Routinely screening patients with PCOS for endometrial cancer is not recommended, but physicians should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for this malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy, or both are recommended for patients with prolonged amenorrhea or abnormal uterine bleeding, especially those who are overweight.
4. What Is the First-Line Drug Therapy for Women With PCOS Who Want to Become Pregnant. Letrozole is preferred over clomiphene for ovulation induction. 4 Patients should be counseled about the elevated risk of a multiple pregnancy with use of either of these drugs.

Health professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism. Reported unwanted excess hair growth should be considered important, regardless of apparent clinical severity. This third consensus recommendation was based on a systematic review of quality of life and included a study with 97 adolescents with PCOS.

Investigations not recommended

Pelvic ultrasound for PCOS diagnosis

Pelvic ultrasound should not be used for the diagnosis of PCOS in those with a gynaecological age of < 8 years (< 8 years post menarche) due to the high incidence of multi-follicular ovaries in this life stage. This was a strong consensus recommendation and not an evidence-based recommendation because reliable data regarding longitudinal ovarian morphology are limited. Additionally, the specific 8 years post-menarche cut-off was based on a consensus recommendation by the GDG, consulted with international societies and refined after international peer review. The recommendation also considered 15 studies evaluating the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS in women using various measures and thresholds for ovarian volume and follicle number. However, adult PCOS criteria have been derived from transvaginal ultrasounds, which should be avoided in females not yet sexually active. Three of these 15 studies included adolescents (181 with PCOS and 137 controls), two of which used trans-abdominal ultrasound and one used trans-rectal ultrasound (68 with PCOS and 26 controls). The 12 studies included women aged between 18 and 40 years (average minimum and maximum ages 24.9 and 31.2 years, respectively) (see Section 1.4 in the Technical Report). Additionally, this recommendation considered the physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115dZb7s]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, comprehensive data directly comparing differing imaging approaches in the evaluation of severe androgen excess are lacking; therefore, clinical presentation in tandem with reasoned biochemical evaluation are crucial to determining which imaging modality is most appropriate.

Recommendations
When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, transvaginal ultrasound is the first‐line imaging modality in selected patients and where culturally acceptable. Imaging is not necessary if two Rotterdam criteria are otherwise met (i.e. androgen excess and oligomenorrhoea) unless there are otherwise atypical clinical and biochcemical features.
If clinical indications suggest non‐PCOS pathology, cross‐sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken as appropriate
MRI pelvis should be undertaken if an ovarian tumour is strongly suspected.
Urgent cross‐sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should be undertaken if an adrenal pathology is suspected.

### How frequently is ultrasound required to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome in a clinical population? [^114GocBs]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition, affecting up to 20% of reproductive aged women worldwide. Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) may be present, but is not required for diagnosis. Our study seeks to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in diagnosing or excluding PCOS by 2023 International Guidelines Criteria. Materials and Methods: Subjects were patients seen in a tertiary care referral clinic in whom other causes of hyperandrogenism (HA) were ruled out. All underwent complete history, physical, modified Ferriman Gallwey scoring, and serum androgen testing; followed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess ovarian morphology if indicated. PCOM was identified as antral follicle count ≥ 20 and/or ovarian volume > 10 mL in at least one ovary. After clinical classification, PCOS was diagnosed by at least two of three: biochemical/clinical HA, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), and PCOM. Statistics were calculated using Fisher's exact test and chi-square. Results: In total, 454 subjects were included. 299 were classified as group A/B and did not require TVUS for diagnosis. Of 82 subjects with HA alone, 50 (61.0%) were classified as group C after demonstrating PCOM. Fifty-five subjects had OD alone, 37 (67.3%) of which were classified as group D based on PCOM. In total, 137/454, or 30.2% of subjects required TVUS for diagnosis or exclusion of PCOS. Conclusions: TVUS was necessary in less than one-third of subjects, primarily identifying PCOS groups C or D. Selective use of ovarian ultrasonography may reduce the costs and complexity of epidemiological and clinical studies for PCOS.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex heterogeneous multisystem disorder affecting 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged womenand 3%–11% of adolescent girlsdepending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. PCOS is characterized by oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adult women.PCOS has significant metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular risk factors), reproductive (anovulation, subfertility)and psychological (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, impaired quality of life), sequelae. Diagnosis of PCOS using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria is based on the presence of two of three features: oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical HA and PCOM on ultrasound following exclusion of secondary causes. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence‐based guideline (EBG) for adult women. This guideline with recommendations for PCOS diagnosis and management is underpinned by an extensive process of evidence synthesis involving 37 professional societies and consumer groups around the world, 71 experts in all aspects of PCOS, including consumers and extensive literature review with 40 systematic reviews and 20 narrative reviews detailed in the 1800 page guideline evidence document.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition among reproductive‐aged women, affecting 10%–13% of this population. Underpinned by endocrine abnormalities, the multifaceted nature of PCOS includes diverse metabolic, reproductive, dermatological, and psychological sequelae, which vary depending on lifestyle, environmental, ethnic, and genetic factors. The heterogenous and evolving nature of symptoms across the lifespan in PCOS contributes to its complex presentation and has historically made diagnosis challenging. Based on the International Evidence‐based Guideline PCOS diagnostic criteria, which builds on the earlier consensus‐based Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed in adults on the basis of two of three components: (i) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (ii) ovulatory dysfunction, including anovulation or chronic oligo‐ovulation, and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, after exclusion of other possible aetiologies. Testing for the latter of these criteria (ultrasound or AMH) is only required where the first two criteria are not met. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and ovarian features are not included as they are non‐specific for PCOS at this life stage.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113NN1jM]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in diagnosis states that serum AMH could be used for defining PCOM in adults and should only be used in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm, noting that in patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an AMH level is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis. We recommend that serum AMH should not be used as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS, and serum AMH should not yet be used in adolescents. Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM; however, both tests should not be performed to limit overdiagnosis. Laboratories and healthcare professionals need to be aware of factors that influence AMH in the general population including that serum AMH generally peaks between the ages of 20–25 years in the general population, serum AMH is lower in those with higher BMI in the general population, serum AMH may be suppressed by current or recent COCP use, serum AMH may vary across the menstrual cycle, and that laboratories involved in AMH measurements in females should use population and assay specific cut-offs.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

The aim is to support women and their health care providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on partnership in care and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered. With effective translation, the guideline and health professional and consumer resources will address gaps and priorities identified by women with PCOS and will promote vital future research.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guideline — recommendation categories are defined and applied as follows: "Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations" and "Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, hence evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1)". Evidence Based Recommendations (EBR) are defined as "Evidence sufficient to inform a recommendation made by the guideline development group". Consensus Recommendations (CR) state "In the absence of adequate evidence, a consensus recommendation has been made by the guideline development group, also informed by evidence from the general population". Practice Points (PP) indicate "Evidence not sought. A practice point has been made by the guideline development group where important issues arose from discussion of evidence-based or consensus recommendations".

The clinical calculator "Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome" for polycystic ovary syndrome and amenorrhea.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) in women of reproductive age. This diagnostic tool is based on the presence of two out of three criteria: oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The clinical utility of this calculator is to accurately diagnose PCOS, which is a common endocrine disorder in women that can lead to infertility, metabolic syndrome, and increased cardiovascular risk. The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria exclude other etiologies that can cause similar symptoms, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing's syndrome.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) involves evaluating three key symptoms: amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods, clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound.

The diagnostic process involves three possible symptoms:

1. Amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods
2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism
3. Polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound

The algorithm checks combinations of these symptoms to determine if the diagnostic criteria are met for PCOS. The following logical checks are applied:

- Check for the presence of amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods (A).
- Check for the presence of clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (B).
- Check for the presence of polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound (C).

The criteria are considered met if any two of the three symptoms are present. Specifically:

- If both A and B are true.
- If both A and C are true.
- If both B and C are true.

If at least two conditions out of the three specified are true, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are met

If fewer than two conditions are met, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are not met

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112xKBPy]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has drastic, lifelong consequences for a woman's health and wellbeing. Androgen excess is the most common endocrinopathy of PCOS, with > 80% prevalence. Newly published International Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of PCOS endorse a clinical diagnosis requiring at least 2 out of the following 3 (Rotterdam) criteria: (i) high circulating levels of testosterone (T) or excessive body hair (hirsutism); (ii) intermittent or absent menstrual cycles; (iii) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, provided that related, but distinctly different, endocrine disorders have been excluded. Rotterdam criteria generate 4 PCOS phenotypes: Classic PCOS with type A, hyperandrogenism or hirsutism (HA) + intermittent/absent cycles (ovulatory dysfunction, OD) + polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and type B, HA + OD; type C, HA + PCOM; and type D, OD + PCOM. Phenotype B, however, may eventually be reassigned to Type A when three-dimensional ovarian imaging and standardized anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) assays become widely available, enabling accurate characterization of a woman's ovarian follicle population.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 8–13%. According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed based on the presence of two out of three characteristics: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities (oligo or anovulation), and the detection of polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound, after the exclusion of other causes. The Androgen Excess-PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) state that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction, and the exclusion of other related disorders. While the AE-PCOS and NIH largely agree with the diagnostic criteria outlined in Rotterdam, hyperandrogenism is considered to be a fundamental component in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Reproductive (irregular menses, infertility and pregnancy complications), metabolic (increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and psychological (depression, disordered eating, body image distress, and reduced quality of life) characteristics are associated with PCOS.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111bmTa8]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — ultrasound assessment and PCOM thresholds in adults and adolescents specify that follicle number per ovary (FNPO) ≥ 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults, and when older technology or limited image quality is used, ovarian volume (OV) ≥ 10 mL or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold. There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents. When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM, while transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report OV with a threshold of ≥ 10 mL or FNPS ≥ 10 in either ovary in adults. In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis. Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-specific cut-off values for PCOM should be defined. Training and standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound, including at a minimum documentation of the last menstrual period or stage of cycle, transducer bandwidth frequency, approach/route, total number per 2–9 mm follicles per ovary, measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary, other ovarian features and/or pathology including dominant follicles (≥ 10 mm) which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations, reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO where a dominant follicle is noted, and uterine features including endometrial thickness and pattern.

### Polycystic ovarian syndrome: role of imaging in diagnosis [^114raghG]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age and carries with it significant health risks, including infertility, endometrial hyperplasia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The workup of PCOS has evolved to include the use of pelvic ultrasonography (US). Ovarian imaging is crucial in the evaluation of patients with suspected PCOS. Although findings of polycystic ovaries are commonly seen at routine US and are frequently not associated with PCOS, awareness of the criteria and definitions used in the diagnosis of PCOS is important, especially in patients who are being evaluated for ovulatory dysfunction or hyperandrogenism. The imaging report should be specific and should include ovarian volumes and antral follicle counts, in addition to other pertinent findings (eg, the presence of a dominant follicle or corpus luteum). Because patients are frequently referred for radiologic imaging as a part of clinical workup, and polycystic ovaries are a common incidental finding in women undergoing US for other gynecologic complaints, radiologists should be aware of the current diagnostic criteria for PCOS, the role of imaging in workup for this abnormality, and the pertinent reporting parameters for pelvic US.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates; the risk of multiple pregnancy is increased with clomiphene citrate (alone or with metformin) and therefore cycles may require ultrasound monitoring; clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than clomiphene citrate alone to improve ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates and could be used rather than metformin alone to improve live birth rates, with monitoring of combined cycles equivalent to clomiphene citrate alone.

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider making a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal patients with well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

Adolescence — diagnostic context and natural history in PCOS are outlined: As many as 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche; in one study, persisting oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased androgens, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, or increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, whereas increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistent anovulation; only approximately 40% of adolescent women with menstrual irregularity have polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and investigators suggest that oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years after menarche (or primary amenorrhea at age 16 yrs), that ultrasound criteria should include increased ovarian size (> 10 cm^3), and that hyperandrogenemia rather than just signs of androgen excess should be documented.

Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing's Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence on the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

1.1 Evidence

PCOS is a common disorder with systemic metabolic manifestations. Its etiology is complex, heterogeneous, and poorly understood. There are three definitions for PCOS currently in use that variably rely on androgen excess, chronic anovulation, and PCO to make the diagnosis (Table 1). However, all criteria are consistent in that PCOS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. All three sets of diagnostic criteria include hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, and anovulation. The Rotterdam criteria were the first to incorporate ovarian morphology on ultrasound as part of the diagnostic criteria.

The panel from a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology workshop on PCOS endorsed the Rotterdam criteria, although they identified the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three cardinal features (Table 2). These criteria allow the diagnosis to be made clinically (based upon a history of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation) as well as biochemically with androgen assays or with ultrasound examination of the ovaries. We do not endorse the need for universal screening with androgen assays or ultrasound if patients already meet two of the three criteria clinically. It is recommended that the features leading to the diagnosis are documented. We recommend using the current definition of the Rotterdam criteria to document PCO morphology (at least one ovary with 12 follicles of 2–9 mm or a volume > 10 mL in the absence of a dominant follicle > 10 mm), in the absence of age-based criteria.

Disorders that mimic PCOS are comparatively easy to exclude; therefore, all women should be screened with a TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP level (Table 3). Hyperprolactinemia can present with amenorrhea or hirsutism. Thyroid disease may present with irregular menstrual cycles. In women with hyperandrogenism, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be excluded because it can be found in 1.5–6.8% of patients presenting with androgen excess. In select women who present with amenorrhea, virilization, or physical findings not associated with PCOS, such as proximal muscle weakness (Cushing's syndrome) or frontal bossing (acromegaly), other diagnoses should be considered and excluded (Table 4).

### Ultrasound alone does not diagnose PCOS… [^114nHqa1]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does an ultrasound report of polycystic ovaries mean that a women is likely to be infertile. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Case-control. Synopsis: A polycystic appearance of the ovaries is defined as at least 10 cysts in a single plane, each less than 10 mm in diameter, and with a dense stroma. This polycystic appearance is found in one fourth to one third of women of reproductive age, and may cause them and their physicians to be concerned about subfertility. Polycystic ovary syndrome is defined variably and usually includes menstrual disturbance, obesity, acne, and hirsutism, with or without polycystic ovaries on imaging. In this case-control study, 258 women who met the criteria for polycystic ovaries were compared with 232 women whose ovaries had a normal appearance. All of the participants had attempted to conceive.

In the group with polycystic ovaries, 84 women who had no other signs or symptoms associated with PCOS had a mean time to pregnancy similar to that of women with normal-appearing ovaries. The proportion of subfertile women was 12 percent with none of the above symptoms and increased among women with one to four additional PCOS symptoms to 36, 78, 94, and 100 percent, respectively, regardless of the combination. Bottom Line: A polycystic appearance of the ovaries on ultrasonography is common in women of reproductive age. Women have normal fertility if they have polycystic ovaries on ultrasound examination and no other characteristics of PCOS, including menstrual disturbance, obesity, acne, and hirsutism.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — androgen assessment while on combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and monitoring: It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the COCP as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotropin-dependent androgen production, and if assessment is imperative the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time. For follow-up, repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role, and in development, in most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12–15 years of age.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.
