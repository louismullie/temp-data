## Question

How to discontinue temazepam

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to safely discontinue temazepam, with a step-by-step plan and attention to best practices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about assessing dependence risk and whether tapering is indicated. Then, I should verify the care setting and level of supervision needed. Next, I will consider whether to switch to a longer-acting benzodiazepine. After that, I need to set the initial taper pace and practical dosing strategy. Then, I should plan monitoring and symptom-driven adjustments, including adjunctive treatments. I will also address special populations and safety issues, and finally outline post-discontinuation follow-up and documentation requirements, making sure I double-check each step against guidelines and labels as I go.

> Let me first confirm the dependence risk and whether tapering is indicated, because abrupt discontinuation of temazepam can precipitate life-threatening withdrawal, including seizures, especially with longer duration and higher doses. I need to check dose, duration, frequency, prior missed-dose reactions, and co-medications, and I should not assume that short-term use is automatically safe since dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients [^115T3Cwm] [^111HaPj4] [^112mN5d2]. Hold on, I should verify the risk stratification: patients using therapeutic doses daily or near-daily for more than a few weeks are likely to be physically dependent and should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly, whereas those using intermittently for under a month at low doses may be able to discontinue with a short taper or close monitoring for rebound and withdrawal symptoms [^113zNPkL] [^111ef2x5] [^115Zjn3Z].

> Next, I should review the care setting, because most patients can taper as outpatients, but I need to ensure inpatient or residential management if there is imminent safety risk from continued use, complex co-occurring psychiatric or medical conditions, or anticipated severe or complicated withdrawal. I should double-check that my threshold for escalation aligns with consensus guidance and that I have a plan for seizure risk assessment and monitoring if inpatient care is chosen [^116YUBwV] [^113Y7XBb] [^117MFd39]. Wait, let me verify that I am not over-calling inpatient care; the default is outpatient with structured follow-up unless the risk–benefit analysis clearly favors a higher level of care [^116YUBwV].

> I will now examine whether to switch to a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam. Temazepam is short-acting, which increases interdose withdrawal risk, so a cross-taper to diazepam can smooth the taper, but I should confirm there are no contraindications like hepatic impairment or prior adverse reactions, and I should calculate an approximate diazepam-equivalent dose using accepted equivalence tables before transitioning one dose at a time over 1–2 weeks while monitoring response [^111wCmGW] [^113GEiFa] [^116H9FZP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Switching is conditional and patient-specific, so I need to ensure the patient understands the rationale and agrees to the plan [^111wCmGW].

> Now, I need to set the initial taper pace. I should confirm that a reasonable starting point is a 5–10% dose reduction every 2–4 weeks, with a hard ceiling of no more than 25% every 2 weeks, and I should start at the lower end, around 5%, for the first reduction to gauge tolerance, especially in those with long-term or high-dose use. If the patient is on a very low dose, I should consider obtaining lower-strength tablets or using a compounding pharmacy to enable small decrements, and I must remember that the taper may take months to over a year for long-term users [^111wCmGW] [^113vUkGX] [^1169JqwH]. Wait, I should double-check that I am not suggesting a fixed schedule; the pace must be individualized and adjusted based on symptoms at each step [^116qxA3Y].

> Let me think about practical dosing strategy for temazepam. Typical strengths are 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, so for a 15 mg nightly dose I could reduce to 12 mg by using one 7.5 mg plus half of a 7.5 mg tablet, then to 10.5 mg, and so on, while ensuring the patient can accurately split tablets or access compounded microdoses if needed. I should confirm the patient's ability to execute the plan and provide clear written instructions to avoid dosing errors [^112mw24q]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to reduce by 25% right away; that would be too fast for most, so I will stick to 5–10% decrements and only consider faster if the patient is at low risk and tolerates it well [^111wCmGW].

> Next, I should review monitoring and symptom-driven adjustments. I need to ensure contact within 1–2 weeks after each dose change to assess withdrawal, rebound insomnia, anxiety, autonomic symptoms, and functional impact, and if symptoms are moderate to severe, I should pause or slow the taper, consider smaller decrements, or temporarily return to the prior dose until stabilized. I should also proactively slow the pace as the total dose approaches zero, the so-called tail-end phenomenon, and I must avoid abrupt discontinuation even if the patient requests it [^1139MggH] [^111XCZes] [^114tJUcC]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing red flags for seizures or delirium. If present, urgent escalation and possibly inpatient management are warranted [^113Y7XBb].

> I will now consider adjunctive interventions. Behavioral therapies such as CBT for insomnia and anxiety should be offered early because they improve discontinuation success and reduce withdrawal burden, and I should coordinate non-benzodiazepine treatments for the underlying indication, for example, SSRIs or SNRIs for anxiety and CBT-I for insomnia. If pharmacologic adjuncts are needed for withdrawal symptoms, I should preferentially use agents without direct GABA-A activity and avoid layering sedatives that could worsen withdrawal or create new dependencies, recognizing that evidence for adjunctive medications is limited and mixed [^111uVNG8] [^111EqpPc] [^112EKKmp]. Wait, let me verify that I am not recommending agents with GABAergic effects; I should avoid z-drugs and other sedatives that act on GABA receptors during the taper to prevent exacerbation or prolongation of withdrawal [^112EKKmp].

> But wait, what if the patient belongs to a special population? For older adults, I should generally recommend tapering given elevated risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and overdose, and I should use the lowest feasible starting decrement and consider switching to diazepam for smoother tapering. For patients with co-occurring SUD, I should coordinate SUD treatment in parallel, avoid abrupt cessation, and consider higher levels of care if instability is anticipated. For patients on opioids, I must counsel on overdose risk, co-prescribe naloxone, and avoid rapid tapers that could destabilize pain or SUD care. For pregnancy, I should balance maternal–fetal risks and generally favor tapering when feasible [^112k35oi] [^117F7RW2] [^117Jxcqf]. I should double-check that my plan aligns with harm-reduction principles and shared decision-making in these scenarios [^112k35oi].

> I need to ensure I address seizure risk explicitly. I should screen for prior seizures, medications that lower seizure threshold, and PDMP findings of multiple benzodiazepines or interacting agents, and if risk is identified, I should slow the taper further and have a clear emergency plan. Although routine anticonvulsant prophylaxis is not consensus, some clinicians use agents like levetiracetam in high-risk inpatient withdrawals, and I should avoid flumazenil outside of carefully selected contexts due to precipitated withdrawal and seizure risk [^113Am2eX] [^113Y7XBb] [^115hZuLs]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying prophylactic anticonvulsants for all; management should be individualized and setting-specific [^113Y7XBb].

> Next, I should review post-discontinuation follow-up. I will schedule check-ins within 2–4 weeks after the last dose to monitor for protracted withdrawal symptoms that can persist weeks to months, educate the patient that these symptoms reflect neuroadaptation and are expected to resolve, and avoid reinstating benzodiazepines unless absolutely necessary. If symptoms are severe, I should consider non-benzodiazepine medications targeting the symptom cluster and provide psychosocial support, documenting the rationale for any pharmacologic choices [^113YCSLt] [^111qFhht] [^115hdkrZ]. I should double-check that I have a plan for relapse prevention and coping strategies during this vulnerable period [^113YCSLt].

> Finally, I need to ensure meticulous documentation and shared decision-making. I should record the risk–benefit assessment, the agreed taper schedule, monitoring plan, emergency instructions, and consent, and I should provide the patient with a written summary and medication guide. If I must taper against the patient's wishes due to safety concerns, I should document the rationale, offer alternatives, and maintain close follow-up to avoid abandonment, aligning with ethical and regulatory guidance [^112VECZ1] [^114ZHVWj] [^1119sxwZ]. Hold on, I should verify that my documentation captures dose-equivalence calculations and any off-label compounding requests to support safe, coherent care across providers [^notfound].

Taper temazepam **gradually** to reduce withdrawal risk [^1166t2RW], using a **patient-specific plan** with dose reductions of 5–10% every 2–4 weeks [^111wCmGW] and avoiding reductions > 25% every 2 weeks [^115jvcSM]. Monitor for withdrawal at each step [^115jvcSM]; if symptoms occur, **pause or slow the taper** and consider switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam) if needed [^116H9FZP]. Provide CBT-I and sleep hygiene [^111EqpPc], and avoid abrupt discontinuation unless there is a compelling safety reason [^113zNPkL] [^112noPHf]. Taper duration varies with use and dose; for long-term or high-dose use, it may take months to over a year [^1169JqwH] [^116FTYzJ].

---

## Clinical indications for tapering temazepam

Tapering is indicated when the **risks outweigh the benefits** [^115JbCtu], including:

- **Long-term use**: > 3 months of regular use [^111HaPj4].
- **High doses**: > 15 mg/day [^111ELqEw].
- **Adverse effects**: Cognitive impairment, falls, respiratory depression, dependence [^116yr6a2] [^117JxZyB].
- **Co-occurring conditions**: Substance use disorder, psychiatric comorbidities, pregnancy [^112k35oi].

---

## Risks associated with abrupt discontinuation

Abrupt discontinuation of temazepam can cause **severe withdrawal**, including:

- **Seizures**: Life-threatening [^115T3Cwm].
- **Delirium**: Acute confusional states [^113Y7XBb].
- **Rebound insomnia**: Worsening sleep disturbance [^111ELqEw].
- **Anxiety and agitation**: Common withdrawal symptoms [^111HGttc].

---

## Recommended tapering strategies

### General principles

- **Gradual taper**: Reduce dose by 5–10% every 2–4 weeks [^113GEiFa].
- **Maximum reduction**: Do not exceed 25% every 2 weeks [^115jvcSM].
- **Patient-specific**: Tailor to response and tolerance [^116qxA3Y].

---

### Specific tapering schedules

| **Patient profile** | **Initial reduction** | **Subsequent reductions** | **Total duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Short-term use (< 3 months) | 10–25% every 1–2 weeks | Adjust based on tolerance | 4–8 weeks |
| Long-term use (> 3 months) | 5–10% every 2–4 weeks | Slower as dose decreases | 6–12 months or longer [^116H9FZP] |
| High-dose or complex cases | 2.5–5% every 2–4 weeks | Microtapering near end | 12–24 months [^116kfy7z] |

---

### Switching to longer-acting benzodiazepines

Switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam) can smooth withdrawal and improve adherence; **diazepam** is preferred for its long half-life and multiple strengths [^116H9FZP].

---

## Monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms

- **Regular monitoring**: Assess at each reduction for withdrawal and recurrence [^115hdkrZ].
- **Symptom management**: Pause or slow taper if significant symptoms occur [^1139MggH].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: CBT-I, sleep hygiene, and non-benzodiazepine medications as needed [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Slower taper due to higher sensitivity and fall risk [^111XPBvD].
- **Pregnancy**: Gradual taper recommended; monitor closely [^112k35oi].
- **Substance use disorder**: Coordinate with addiction specialists; consider inpatient care if needed [^1132sMwV].

---

## Patient education and support

Education should cover **withdrawal symptoms**, the taper plan, and the risks of abrupt discontinuation [^114ZHVWj]. Support should include **CBT-I**, sleep hygiene, and access to peer support to improve outcomes [^111EqpPc].

---

## Clinical outcomes and success rates

Success rates vary with adherence, support, and taper speed; **CBT-I** improves success and reduces withdrawal severity [^111XPBvD].

---

Tapering temazepam should be **gradual and individualized**, with close monitoring and adjunctive support to minimize withdrawal and maximize success [^116qxA3Y].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1113JqMh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — patient-specific strategy and goals: Patients who have been taking lower doses for a relatively short period of time (e.g., < 3 months) may be able to taper more quickly, and the goal of tapering may be discontinuing the benzodiazepine (BZD) medication or reducing the BZD dose to the point where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust tapering based on patient response; clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper, should monitor for the emergence of BZD withdrawal signs and symptoms with each dose reduction and, if significant signs or symptoms emerge, the taper should be slowed or paused, and because some patients experience significant withdrawal symptoms even with gradual tapering, they should be offered slower tapering as needed, with some cases allowing maintenance on a lower dose if this reduces current risks such that they no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should consider adjunctive psychosocial interventions as part of the comprehensive BZD tapering strategy, including evidence-based interventions for BZD discontinuation such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); they should provide concurrent treatment for any co-occurring physical health conditions and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs); and should employ harm reduction strategies such as providing opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) to those concomitantly taking opioids or otherwise at risk of opioid overdose, connecting patients to local resources, and providing patient education based on each individual patient's risks. It may take months to years to fully taper off BZDs, particularly if patients have been taking a high dose for an extended period of time.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117BBiTo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Lithium: gradual discontinuation of lithium (at least over a month) reduces risk of DS and early recurrence relative to rapid discontinuation. In clinical practice, lithium and other mood stabilizers are often tapered hyperbolically (Supplementary Text). If lithium needs to be discontinued because of inefficacy or severe side effects, it may be replaced with another mood stabilizer or SGA.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: it is unclear whether this also applies to other mood stabilizers.

Dose reduction

Lithium: for lithium, recommended effective doses for the prevention of manic and depressive episodes result in blood plasma levels of 0.6–0.8 mmol/l, or, in some cases, 0.4–0.6 mmol/l. Dose reductions below these levels may diminish effectiveness.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: minimally effective blood levels are less robustly established than for lithium: 50 mg/l for valproate, 4 mg/l for carbamazepine, and 3 mg/l for lamotrigine.

Discontinuation interventions

There are no known interventions to reduce relapse risk or DS during or after mood stabilizer discontinuation. Closely monitoring mood symptoms during discontinuation of mood stabilizers is recommended, for at least 1 year.

Benzodiazepines

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Relapse rates for benzodiazepines are generally intricate to ascertain given the diversity of symptoms for which benzodiazepines are prescribed. Nevertheless, the majority of patients succeed in discontinuing benzodiazepines, as shown by systematic reviews and meta-analyses that found an average 1-year discontinuation success rate of 55–64%.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Most patients discontinuing benzodiazepines experience some degree of DS (59–78%). Physical DS of benzodiazepine discontinuation include muscle tension, weakness, spasms, pain, and influenza-like symptoms (sweating and shivering). Psychological DS include anxiety and panic attacks, restlessness, agitation, depression, mood swings, concentration difficulties, and sleep disturbances. In rare instances, rapid discontinuation may induce more severe DS, including seizures and psychotic symptoms. DS may emerge or worsen weeks after discontinuation, with highest risks in short elimination half-life benzodiazepines (temazepam and lorazepam).

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

Patients often want to stop after long-term benzodiazepine use, but face barriers such as dependence and misuse, reliance on benzodiazepines for comfort, and anticipation of sleep problems. Intrinsic motivation and sufficient time to consider the benefits of discontinuation can help.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — key recommendations state that clinicians should engage in ongoing risk–benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering; clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients; clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal; clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response; and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116YUBwV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

3 If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Recommendation for Partnering with Patients
4 Clinicians should develop the BZD tapering strategy in coordination with patients and their care partners in a shared decision-making process whenever possible (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendation for Level of Care Considerations
5 BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings. However, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when: a Patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the BZD medication (e.g. medication interaction, overdose, accidents, falls, suicidality or other self-harm) that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) b Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) c The patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

Adjunctive interventions during benzodiazepine tapering — clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation), and clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when symptoms significantly interfere with the taper; however, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Benzodiazepine tapering — managing mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms — "Most patients (but not all) will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper". When symptoms are challenging, "the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10". If those measures are unsuccessful, "clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yr6a2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk–benefit rationale and duration guidance: In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits, with risks including oversedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

Regarding medical management for catatonia, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to taper benzodiazepines gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly. Decide on the speed of the taper depending on a balance of the therapeutic benefits and the risks of withdrawal effects against the possibility of dependence and the risks of long-term harm from benzodiazepines.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116RJjo9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Considerations for tapering benzodiazepines — risk–benefit assessment frequency states that "Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)". It adds, "At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)".

### Deprescribing benzodiazepine receptor agonists for insomnia in adults… [^111XPBvD]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- A slow taper of BZRAs is recommended in patients 18 to 64 years of age who use these most days of the week for more than four weeks.
- Patients 65 years and older taking a BZRA for any duration should be recommended to taper off slowly.
- A slow taper with a 25% dose reduction every two weeks and medication-free days at the end of the taper is suggested. Deprescribing BZRAs has been proven successful in studies and is associated with only mild withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing options include abrupt discontinuation, tapering, cognitive behavior therapy provided by trained personnel or via self-help, CBT and tapering combined, using lower dosages, using BZRAs as needed, or switching medications. CBT combined with tapering improved BZRA cessation when compared with tapering alone.

CBT for insomnia includes education regarding sleep, regulating stimulation, limiting sleep, sleep hygiene, and relaxation, and is associated with improved sleep and long-term benefits. Figure 1 is an algorithm for deprescribing BZRAs. It should be noted that switching to a long-acting BZRA does not improve cessation rates or reduce withdrawal symptoms compared with tapering short-acting BZRAs. Although the systematic review did not compare different tapering schedules, a very slow taper with a 25% dose reduction every two weeks and medication-free days at the end was used in several trials. Options include 50% reduction and switching to lorazepam or oxazepem during final tapering if the patient's current dosage does not allow tapering in 25% increments. Various behavioral management strategies may be considered for patients who experience a recurrence of insomnia during attempts to taper BZRAs.

In the primary care setting, these strategies include recommending that the patient go to bed only when tired; use the bed only for sleep or intimacy; leave the bed if not asleep within 30 minutes, even if awakened in the night one or more times; maintain consistency in waking up at the same time every day; avoid naps; avoid consuming caffeine in the afternoon; and avoid physical activity, nicotine, alcohol, and eating a large amount of food two hours before going to bed.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1127JFjt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper. However, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients. As a result, determining whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal is not always clear (see Table 3). Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. One of the most significant challenges the CGC faced in writing this Guideline was developing tapering recommendations that apply broadly in the context of this patient heterogeneity. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses.

The CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper, particularly given the heterogeneity in responses to BZD tapering. It is important to educate patients on what to do if they experience concerning symptoms and how to contact their clinicians, if necessary, before the next scheduled visit. This can help patients feel more confident and in control of a process that is often associated with some level of apprehension.

Prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers, if applicable, and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions that may be impacted by the taper. In addition, clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper (see Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents). A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.

Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

Controlled Substance

Temazepam is a controlled substance in Schedule IV.

Abuse and Dependence

Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal, and muscle cramps, vomiting, and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy at doses higher than 15 mg, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. As with any hypnotic, caution must be exercised in administering temazepam to individuals known to be addiction-prone or to those whose history suggests they may increase the dosage on their own initiative. It is desirable to limit repeated prescriptions without adequate medical supervision.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111qFhht]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Management of protracted withdrawal after benzodiazepine (BZD) discontinuation — Some patients may experience protracted symptoms of withdrawal after BZD discontinuation, which may result from a combination of physical and psychological BZD dependence and the neurological effects of BZDs. Longer-term BZD use and use of high-dose, rapid-acting BZDs increase the risk of protracted withdrawal, although these post-acute symptoms can also occur after discontinuation of low-dose BZDs. Protracted symptoms persist beyond the expected elimination of the BZD (e.g., 4–6 weeks), and some patients experience symptoms for months or years; in a convenience sample of 1,200 individuals more than 50% reported feeling dependent when taking benzodiazepines, and a large survey estimated that 54% sought medical services after BZD discontinuation. Although limited research exists, the CCG agreed protracted withdrawal causes significant harms for a subset of patients, and current guidance suggests gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may reduce the risk of protracted withdrawal symptoms.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this Guideline is clinicians — including behavioral health professionals, physicians, advanced practice providers, and pharmacists — who prescribe BZDs or provide or support treatment for indications for which BZDs are often prescribed. This Guideline is relevant to clinicians who practice in diverse settings such as primary care offices, ambulatory care clinics for a broad range of specialty clinicians, EDs, hospitals, and outpatient and residential addiction and mental health treatment settings. Some recommendations only apply to specific settings (e.g. inpatient treatment, medically managed settings), as indicated in the narrative. Clinicians in palliative and end-of-life care are not the intended audience for this Guideline. This Guideline may be useful for healthcare administrators, insurers, and policymakers who implement policies related to medical practice. However, this Guideline is not intended to be a source of rigid laws, regulations, or policies related to BZD prescribing or tapering. The recommendations contained in this Guideline support flexible, patient-centered care.

Qualifying Statement

This Guideline is intended to aid clinicians in their clinical decision-making and patient management (see Box 3). It strives to identify and define clinical decision-making junctures that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. Clinical decision-making should consider the quality and availability of expertise and services in the community wherein care is provided. The recommendations in this Guideline reflect the consensus of an independent committee (see " Methodology ") convened beginning January 2023. This Guideline will be updated periodically as clinical and scientific knowledge advances.

Prescribed courses of treatment described in this Guideline are most effective if the patient understands and adheres to the recommendations. Clinicians should make every effort to promote patients' understanding of and adherence to prescribed and recommended treatment services to improve outcomes.

This Guideline aims to set the standard for best clinical practice by providing recommendations for the appropriate care of patients tapering from BZDs in diverse settings. Patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options and welcomed as active parties to shared decision-making. In circumstances in which this Guideline is used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the central goal should be improvement in quality of care. Recommendations in this Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulations.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Many of the topics discussed in this Guideline lacked controlled studies. Our systematic review found no trials comparing BZD tapering strategies or other important aspects of managing patients who are taking prescribed BZDs and likely to have developed physical dependence. Further research into best practices for BZD tapering strategies that support patient safety and optimal outcomes is urgently needed.

Box 2 note of caution — avoid misapplication of this Guideline explains that clinical practice guidelines can have unintended impacts on clinical decision-making and that misapplication of the 2016 CDC opioid recommendations led some prescribers to abruptly discontinue pain medications without first developing a plan for safe tapering, putting patients at risk of withdrawal and potential transition to illegally obtained opioids. It warns that abrupt discontinuation of BZDs confers similar and additional risks: rapid BZD dose reduction can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and delirium and potential destabilization of existing mental health conditions, especially in those taking long-term BZDs and at higher doses. It states that BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and that clinicians and healthcare systems should carefully consider how to meet the needs of patients requiring BZD tapering, including those who experience significant challenges during the tapering process.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1119sxwZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Safety concerns for inherited patients — assumption of prescribing, referrals, and non-abandonment indicate that clinicians sometimes inherit patients who have been prescribed high-dose and/or long-term BZDs. Clinicians can attempt to consult with prior prescribers and other relevant physical and mental health providers, and clinicians should follow the recommendations in this Guideline when assuming responsibility for new patients, including assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing. Patients may require extra time to understand the rationale behind a recommendation for tapering and buy into the tapering plan. If clinicians are not comfortable assuming responsibility for these prescriptions, they can consider referring these patients to another provider or a more intensive level of care, as appropriate, with a bridging prescription to prevent abrupt discontinuation of the BZD medication. It is critical that patients at risk of BZD withdrawal are not abandoned, and alternatively, clinicians may consider initiating a taper without patient agreement.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112EKKmp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — risk–benefit assessment and mortality signal: prescribing clinicians "should carefully consider the risks and benefits of continued BZD use as well as the likely risks and benefits of tapering for a given patient and should not assume tapering is the right choice for all patients", and "Tapering should be undertaken carefully, with close monitoring and adjustments based on a patient's response". A retrospective cohort of a US commercial healthcare claims database (n = 353,576 patients) reported that over a 6-month period mortality among those who discontinued BZD was 1.6 times higher than those who continued, but the analysis "could not examine the reason for discontinuation and did not account for the rate of tapering or discontinuation", and the CCG "do not believe these findings should outweigh" broader evidence given that "the reason for discontinuation and the speed of the taper were not considered".

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

### Temazepam [^115T3Cwm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Before prescribing temazepam capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of temazepam capsules, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of temazepam capsules along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam capsules or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Temazepam Capsules).

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including temazepam capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE, Dependence).

Benzodiazepine tapering — assessing and managing seizure risk — "Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures". They should also review concomitant medications because "medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures", and "PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold". If risk is identified, "clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication". The guideline further notes variation in practice — "The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk" — and that "Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g., levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal".

Adjunctive psychosocial interventions during benzodiazepine tapering — recommendations and evidence: The CPG recommends that clinicians offer adjunctive psychosocial interventions to patients tapering from BZDs, especially those whose daily functioning has been negatively impacted by withdrawal symptoms. A systematic review which found gradual tapering supported by adjunctive psychosocial interventions was more effective than gradual tapering alone. A Cochrane review found moderate-quality evidence that patients were more likely to have successfully discontinued BZDs at 1 month and 3 months post-treatment when they received CBT during the tapering process, and a meta-analysis showed a significantly higher rate of BZD discontinuation at 6 months and 12 months with a brief intervention delivered in primary care, with risk ratios of 2.73 and 3.41, respectively. Sleep hygiene interventions may also help support successful tapering, and incorporating sleep hygiene education and psychosocial support during BZD tapering has been shown to lead to short-term reductions in BZD use as well as long-term discontinuation in older adults. Peer specialist services are another resource and can be delivered one-on-one or in group settings, as well as in-person or virtually, and where available peer specialist services and other psychosocial support should be provided at no cost to patients.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

Community safety during benzodiazepine tapering — documentation and transitions specify that when continued BZD prescribing jeopardizes community safety, clinicians should explain the reasons for their decision to taper to patients, carefully documenting the rationale and related discussions, and best practices include providing a written summary to patients. If concerns for community safety necessitate discharging patients from their care, clinicians should offer referrals to appropriate alternative providers or treatment services that can manage the patient's individualized needs during the tapering process, providing warm handoffs as appropriate if patients are amenable. If patients decline the referral, clinicians may consider a BZD tapering plan that accounts for the safety of all parties.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
The use of benzodiazepines, including temazepam capsules, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing temazepam capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS).
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including temazepam capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam capsules after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam capsules or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS).

METHODOLOGY

ASAM's Quality Improvement Council (QIC) and Clinical Practice Guideline Methodology and Oversight Committee (CPG-MOS) oversaw the development of this Guideline. The FDA provided guidance on the content and development of the Guideline but did not dictate the content. The QIC, working with partner professional societies and the FDA, oversaw the appointment of a Clinical Guideline Committee (CGC) comprised of clinicians representing ten medical and professional societies with broad subject matter expertise across medicine, psychiatry, and pharmacology. A panel of individuals who have lived experience with BZD tapering (the Patient Panel) provided input during the development of the Guideline.

The following key clinical questions were addressed in the systematic literature review:
What is the efficacy and/or safety of tapering strategies for BZDs?
What factors influence the outcomes of BZD tapering and should be monitored?
How can shared decision-making and patient-centered health care be utilized to support the effectiveness and safety of BZD tapering?

These questions were used to develop a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework for identifying relevant research literature to answer each of the key clinical questions.
Population: Adults who have been using one or more BZD medication for at least 2–4 weeks, including those with benzodiazepine use disorder
Intervention: two types of interventions were considered: Interventions that promote the successful discontinuation of BZD use Interventions that manage withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing BZDs
Comparator: alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition
Outcome: BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g. insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^112S8Sg5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation symptoms are common but remain difficult to predict

First, discontinuation symptoms are common, particularly after abrupt or rapid cessation of medication, except in the case of stimulants. These symptoms generally dampen over time and seem less likely when discontinuation occurs gradually. In general, DS risk is higher for psychotropic drugs with shorter elimination half-lives, such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, clozapine, morphine, oxycodone, lorazepam, and temazepam (Table 1). Nevertheless, estimations of DS prevalence across medication groups are heterogeneous (see also Table 1). A challenge is that DS are often not measured at all, and, if measured, their operationalization varies (e.g. concerning questionnaires, cutoff values, and time points). Moreover, in many blinded studies, medication is abruptly stopped. Thus, current estimations of DS not only reflect the situation following abrupt or very quick cessation, but also include the influence of expectations and patients and clinicians' experiences and may thus be subject to nocebo effects. Finally, it can be challenging to disentangle DS from relapse due to symptom overlap. This may result in DS being misdiagnosed as relapse in discontinuation studies.

Do not discontinue medication too quickly

Second, it is clear that abrupt discontinuation is not only associated with DS, but also entails increased relapse risks. Nevertheless, the optimal period during which medication should be discontinued and the rate of dose reduction are unclear. Pragmatically, discontinuation over months is advisable, but evidence for these strategies is lacking. Gradual lowering of the dose is generally recommended for several reasons. First, relapse may be less severe if a patient is on a medium or low dose relative to discontinuation. Second, steady-state may be more readily re-achieved if relapse occurs while a patient is on a lower dose. Third, gradual tapering may be more comfortable for patients because of the decreased likelihood of DS. Gradual tapering is often possible using conventional dose regimens, and many patients can discontinue using these existing doses. Nevertheless, when discontinuation poses a greater challenge, a gradual decrease with low doses may be feasible. Another option that becomes apparent across medication classes is the possibility to switch to long-acting agents, e.g. diazepam, sustained-release buprenorphine and fluoxetine (although of the latter intervention only case reports are known). For some medications, e.g. opioids and antipsychotics, (demographic) variables have been associated with successful tapering, but given the lack of replicated findings these are not ready for translation into clinical practice.

Recommendations for the Tapering Process
6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Adjunctive Interventions
10 Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation).
11 Clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper (e.g. sleep difficulty, anxiety). However, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Recommendations for Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms

12 Clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g. residential withdrawal management program) with:

Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
Assessments for seizure risk, managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

13 Tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital: a Can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

14 Clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPERING BENZODIAZEPINES

Determining Whether to Taper

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines
Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Tapering is indicated for patients who are likely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg. In transient insomnia, a 7.5 mg dose may be sufficient to improve sleep latency. In elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 7.5 mg until individual responses are determined.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Restoril

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Restoril or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

### Tapering patients off of benzodiazepines… [^116kfy7z]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

HOW TO TAPER Abruptly discontinuing benzodiazepines after a patient has been taking them daily for more than one month is potentially dangerous; withdrawal can be severe or even life-threatening. Taper schedules should be individualized, considering factors such as lifestyle, personality, environmental stressors, reasons for taking benzodiazepines, and amount of available personal and clinical support. Because anticipatory anxiety is often related to withdrawal, benzodiazepines are commonly tapered slowly, with psychological support emphasized during the process to help patients learn alternative coping skills. 5 whereas others recommend a fairly rapid schedule, with the option to slow down if withdrawal symptoms become unmanageable. 8 For some patients, tapers longer than six months may lead to too much focus on the taper process, causing further anxiety and possible worsening of long-term outcomes.

6, 8 Still, other patients may do much better with slower, longer tapers. Even benzodiazepine tapers lasting one to two years can be successful. There are three basic approaches to a benzodiazepine taper: use the same medication for tapering; switch to a longer-acting equivalent; and use adjunctive medications to help mitigate potential withdrawal symptoms. The dosage reduction mainly depends on the starting dose and whether the patient is tapering as an inpatient or outpatient. For safety reasons, outpatient tapers usually need to be slower than inpatient tapers. Patients taking higher dosages of benzodiazepines can usually tolerate larger reductions than those taking lower dosages. Supratherapeutic doses can initially be reduced by 25% to 30%, then further reduced by 5% to 10% daily, weekly, or monthly as appropriate, based on how well the patient tolerates withdrawal symptoms during the taper. Addition of an anticonvulsant should be considered for high-dosage withdrawal. For complex cases, stabilizing the dose at a 50% reduction for several months before resuming the taper may improve tolerability. 8 At the end of the taper, some patients may need to reduce the pace with nearly homeopathic dosage reductions to tolerate the withdrawal. Compounding pharmacies can be used to obtain very small doses near the end of the taper.

Key Takeaways

This Guideline aims to assist clinicians in helping patients who have developed physical dependence safely taper BZDs while minimizing withdrawal symptoms and associated risks. The recommendations in this Guideline address considerations for tapering, level of care, tapering strategies, withdrawal management, and specific patient populations.

Due to the paucity of evidence addressing BZD tapering strategies, the majority of the recommendations in this Guideline are based on clinical consensus. Three recommendation statements are based on low-quality evidence from ten studies (see " Summary of Recommendations ").

The following are ten key takeaways of this Guideline for adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence:
Clinicians should base clinical recommendations regarding continued BZD prescribing on ongoing assessment of the risks and benefits of continued BZD use as well as those of tapering/discontinuation (see Table 2). Tapering is generally indicated when the risks of continuing BZD medication outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should conduct more frequent risk–benefit assessments of continued BZD prescribing for patients who: i. Are concomitantly taking opioid medication ii. Have an SUD iii. Have additional risk factors for adverse effects, such as co-occurring physical conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) or mental health conditions (e.g. bipolar spectrum disorder) Clinicians should use caution if utilizing urine drug screen immunoassays for BZDs due to known limitations. Clinicians should consider the maternal–fetal dyad when assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing in patients who are pregnant. Clinicians should taper BZDs in most older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years) unless there are compelling reasons for continuation.
Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and their care partners utilizing shared decision-making strategies.
Clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms (see Recommendation 2 " Rationale " and associated evidence summary). Physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients(see Table 3).
Although most patients can complete BZD tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when patient presentation indicates significant risk that cannot be safely managed in outpatient care.
Clinicians should design the tapering strategy to minimize harms from both continued BZD use and the tapering process, such as withdrawal symptoms and recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. The initial pace of the BZD taper should generally include dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks. The taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks. Patients who have been taking lower doses for a relatively short period of time (e.g. < 3 months) may be able to taper more quickly. The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the point where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust tapering based on patient response. Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (see Appendix B). Clinicians should monitor patients for the emergence of BZD withdrawal signs and symptoms with each dose reduction. If significant signs or symptoms emerge, the taper should be slowed or paused. Some patients experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even with gradual tapering, and should be offered slower tapering as needed. In some cases, maintaining a patient on a lower dose may be sufficient to reduce the current risks such that they no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering adjunctive psychosocial interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) to support successful tapering (see Recommendation 10 " Rationale" and associated evidence summary).
Clinicians should provide concurrent treatment for any co-occurring physical health conditions and psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, that could interfere with the BZD taper.
Clinicians should employ harm reduction strategies — such as providing opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) to those concomitantly taking opioids or otherwise at risk of opioid overdose, connecting patients to local resources, and providing patient education — based on each individual patient's risks.
It may take months to years to fully taper off BZDs, particularly if patients have been taking a high dose for an extended period of time.

Some available guidance points to the availability of liquid formulations for some BZD medications (e.g. diazepam oral solution concentrate) and the use of compounding pharmacies for custom dosage tablets. However, these options come with a higher cost, and not all patients have access to them. In addition, measuring out liquid doses can be challenging for some patients. These strategies are discussed in detail in The Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines. See Appendix 7 for resources on managing challenging dosage reductions with available formulations.

Patients who have been taking lower doses of BZDs for shorter periods of time may desire or be able to taper from the medication more quickly than recommended in this Guideline. Clinicians can reasonably consider if a faster taper may be indicated or if a taper is necessary for patients whose presentation and history suggest a low risk of significant physical dependence and withdrawal.

Clinicians should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies. For example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first. See Appendix 3 for case descriptions and associated sample tapering strategies.

The CGC emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences. The FDA also underscored the importance of developing individualized tapering strategies in a 2020 Drug Safety Communication (2):

To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition.

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when temazepam capsules are used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see WARNINGS, Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Inform patients that the use of temazepam capsules, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS, Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Withdrawal Reactions

Inform patients that the continued use of temazepam capsules may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam capsules may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of temazepam capsules may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^116H9FZP]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

De-prescribing and withdrawal

Professional guidelines recommend treatment withdrawal for most patients on long term benzodiazepines. This usually takes 3 to12 months or longer, often supported by switching to diazepam, a benzodiazepine whose long half life and availability in various strengths allows gradual dose reduction. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effective interventions to support withdrawal, and a recent review failed to identify evidence of sufficient quality to support any pharmacological interventions. Psychosocial interventions may be more promising: cognitive behavioural therapy plus tapering is effective in the short term, and relaxation techniques and individualised GP letters to patients can facilitate withdrawal. However, better evidence is urgently required for both drug and non-drug options.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

As we saw after the release of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain in 2016, Guidelines can have unintended consequences. There may be a large population of patients for whom benzodiazepine tapering is indicated. Clinicians should prioritize those who are at the highest risk of harm. Benzodiazepine medications should not be abruptly discontinued in patients who are physically dependent. Alternative strategies for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal risk (e.g. tapering with very long-acting agents) may be used when there are compelling reasons for more rapid taper or discontinuation and are also discussed in the Guideline. This Guideline should not be used as a reason to abandon patients who require a benzodiazepine taper or continued long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

While considerations for initiating benzodiazepine were outside of the scope of this Guideline, it is clear we need to think carefully about when to start these medications and particularly when to continue with subsequent prescriptions. It is critical that we educate patients on these risks at the outset to support truly informed consent.

Monitoring during benzodiazepine withdrawal — risk, assessment, and tools: Although most patients can successfully taper from BZD in outpatient settings, there are circumstances when withdrawal management should be conducted in inpatient or residential settings, particularly if patients experience severe acute BZD withdrawal. As with any sedative–hypnotic medication, seizure and delirium are two of the more serious adverse events that can occur as part of withdrawal, and clinicians should prioritize assessment and monitoring for seizure risk and other clinically significant symptoms during BZD withdrawal management. Patients who are experiencing or imminently expected to experience severe acute symptoms of BZD withdrawal should be managed in settings appropriate to their risk. Regular patient monitoring is critical during withdrawal management, and inpatient and other medically managed settings typically have protocols for monitoring withdrawal, with the two most important items to monitor being vital signs and patient-reported withdrawal symptoms. Scales designed for monitoring BZD withdrawal symptoms exist, including the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale–Benzodiazepines (CIWA–B) and the BZD Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ), but both were developed with a small number of patients and little to no evidence of validation was found for either; as such, they are not used frequently in clinical practice, and collecting structured information can help improve objectivity and consistency in symptom measurement.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

Tapering Strategies

BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and are at risk of significant withdrawal symptoms (see Table 3). Most existing clinical guidance documents emphasize the importance of gradual dose reductions to discontinue BZD use in these patients. Clinicians can suggest a trial dose reduction for patients who are extremely reluctant or anxious about tapering rather than asking them to commit to a tapering plan. This approach may increase patients' motivation, self-efficacy, and willingness to continue with tapering. However, clinicians should clearly communicate any concerns for patients' safety with ongoing BZD use.

Several BZD tapering strategies have been described in the literature. Evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, with even more gradual reduction at lower doses when approaching discontinuation. Clinical trials that reduced doses at a faster pace tended to have high patient dropout rates. Schweizer et al.noted that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. Oude Voshaar et al.evaluated the same pace and found that nearly a quarter of participants dropped out. Guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. The CGC highlighted the importance of considering a patient's BZD dose, frequency, and duration of use when determining an approach to tapering.

Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies. A more rapid taper may be indicated for patients who have significant imminent safety risks associated with continued BZD use that will not be mitigated sufficiently with smaller dose reductions. If risks are not imminent, clinicians should consider patient preferences more heavily when developing tapering strategies and seek to minimize risks associated with tapering, including withdrawal symptoms.

Feasibility issues may influence the tapering strategy. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given BZD, reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging. Although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians can consider converting the prescription to lower strengths of the same medication as an initial step to facilitate the tapering process. The availability of a greater range of low-dose formulations for commonly prescribed BZDs would help facilitate BZD tapering.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^112LBvns]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The new Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering published in this special issue can assist clinicians with overcoming the dilemmas and uncertainties that have hindered benzodiazepine tapering (when clinically appropriate to do so). This guideline was developed through a partnership of experts from 10 professional societies representing a broad spectrum of specialties that are commonly involved in prescribing or supporting tapering of benzodiazepines: family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, geriatrics, addiction medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatric pharmacy, and medical toxicology. The Guideline emphasizes the importance of a patient-centered process with shared decision making and the goal of maximizing benefits while minimizing harm to each person's health and well-being.

The Guideline recommends regular reassessment of each patient, considering both the risks and benefits of ongoing benzodiazepine therapy as well as those associated with benzodiazepine tapering. Tapering is recommended when the overall risks outweigh the benefits of continued benzodiazepine therapy for the individual. The Guideline also notes that clinicians should generally consider tapering of long-term benzodiazepines in older adults, unless there are compelling reasons for continuation. When benzodiazepine tapering is indicated, the Guideline emphasizes the importance of starting low and going slow (e.g. beginning with a 5–10% reduction in total daily dose every 2–4 weeks), monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal or other negative taper-associated effects following each dose reduction, and adjusting the tapering pace based on each patient's response (i.e. as tolerated by an individual patient).

Guiding principles for implementation of recommendations from the Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering — patient-centered application and scope: The recommendations in this Guideline are intended to support patient-centered care, many complex factors influence decision-making related to BZD tapering with significant heterogeneity in patient response to tapering, and this Guideline should be implemented to allow flexibility in response to diverse clinical circumstances. Healthcare systems, payers, policymakers, and clinicians should avoid misapplying this Guideline beyond its intended scope and should adopt an individualized approach when working with patients, tailoring strategies to each patient's risks, needs, and preferences, and adjusting strategies based on a patient's response. Healthcare systems and policymakers should carefully consider how to best leverage existing healthcare resources to meet the needs of the potentially large population for whom BZD tapering may be indicated. Physical dependence is an expected result of ongoing use of prescribed BZDs and distinct from substance use disorder (SUD); clinicians should not presume that patients with physical dependence have an SUD, and patients with SUD should be managed appropriately with referrals for specialty treatment as necessary.

Adjunctive pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine tapering — evidence scope and guidance: Considerable disagreement exists in the literature on the utility of pharmacological interventions as an adjunct to BZD tapering, and existing clinical guidelines that endorse adjunctive medications do not offer clear guidance on implementation. A Cochrane review was unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of various medications because the quality of the evidence was low or very low and with a high risk of bias. The systematic literature review for this CPG review yielded 28 RCTs on various adjunctive pharmacological interventions, including over-the-counter aids such as melatonin. Although a few small studies have suggested carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, the CPG agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management. Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review.

Risk of bias

Figure 2 shows the risk of bias of trials that compared tapering with usual care, and supplements 3–10 show risk of bias judgments for all trials and outcomes. Nearly all data were rated as being at high risk of bias, primarily owing to concerns about deviations from intended intervention that arose from lack of masking of patients and healthcare providers and potential for differential care across trial arms. Concerns about the randomisation procedures and allocation concealment also contributed to ratings of high risk of bias.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112mN5d2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — heterogeneity and withdrawal risk indicates that although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper; however, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients, making it not always clear whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal. Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses, and the CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper. It can be helpful for clinicians and patients to discuss what to expect with the taper, how to manage withdrawal symptoms, and how to contact clinicians before the next scheduled visit to help patients feel more confident and in control.

### Risks from concomitant use with opioids; abuse,… [^115xXEMv]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Temazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam or reduce the dosage. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam or reduce the dosage.

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including temazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam after continued use, or administration of flumazenil may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of temazepam should be strongly considered for patients who report a "sleep-driving" episode. Other complex behaviors have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic.

Inform patients that the continued use of temazepam may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of temazepam may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of temazepam may require a slow taper. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to temazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg. In transient insomnia, a 7.5 mg dose may be sufficient to improve sleep latency. In elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 7.5 mg until individual responses are determined.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Temazepam Capsules

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam capsules or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) — clinicians should consider more frequent assessments of the risks and benefits of continued use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) for patients with co-occurring SUDs and/or other addictions; when tapering BZD medication in patients with SUD, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD concurrently with the BZD taper; clinicians should not use BZD prescribing or tapering considerations as a reason to discontinue or disrupt a patient's medications for SUD treatment, including buprenorphine and methadone; following the taper, clinicians should continue to monitor and treat the underlying SUDs or refer patients to an appropriate level of care for continuing care. Each of these statements is labeled "Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation".

Benzodiazepine tapering — individualized plan, monitoring, and adjustment emphasize shared decision-making and flexible pacing: The CCG emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences, and the FDA advises: To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition. Tapering often does not proceed at the same pace over the entire process; rather, pacing should be flexibly adjusted based on patient response, and clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each dose reduction and counsel them to report any concerning symptoms. Clinicians should discuss this inherent uncertainty with patients so that, together, they can adjust planned tapering strategies as necessary, should help patients understand that these symptoms commonly reflect physical dependence, and should reassure patients that tapering strategies can be adjusted to address significant symptoms that may occur.

Description

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

Methods

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and clinical consensus process. The process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

Recommendations

Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk–benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering, clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients, clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal, clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response, and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

Safety Concerns for Inherited Patients

Clinicians sometimes inherit patients who have been prescribed high-dose and/or long-term BZDs. The same risk–benefit considerations apply when determining whether to continue prescribing BZD medications for these patients (see Table 2). Clinicians can attempt to consult with prior prescribers and other relevant physical and mental health providers. Clinicians should follow the recommendations in this Guideline when assuming responsibility for new patients, including assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing and engaging in a shared decision-making process with patients and their care partners. Clinicians should recognize that working with new providers can be stressful for patients. Patients may require extra time to understand the rationale behind a recommendation for tapering and buy into the tapering plan.

If clinicians are not comfortable assuming responsibility for these prescriptions, they can consider referring these patients to another provider or a more intensive level of care, as appropriate, with a bridging prescription to prevent abrupt discontinuation of the BZD medication. However, as discussed in Box 2, it is critical that patients at risk of BZD withdrawal are not abandoned. Alternatively, clinicians may consider initiating a taper without patient agreement (see " Tapering Without Patient Agreement ").

Community Safety

When continued BZD prescribing jeopardizes community safety, clinicians should explain the reasons for their decision to taper to patients, carefully documenting the rationale and related discussions. Best practices include providing a written summary to patients. If concerns for community safety necessitate discharging patients from their care, clinicians should offer referrals to appropriate alternative providers or treatment services that can manage the patient's individualized needs during the tapering process, providing warm handoffs as appropriate if patients are amenable. If patients decline the referral, clinicians may consider a BZD tapering plan that accounts for the safety of all parties.

When community safety is a concern, clinicians may need to initiate a more rapid taper than would typically be indicated to balance conflicting obligations. For example, clinicians have a duty to report suspected medication diversion and discontinue prescribing medications if they are being diverted. At the same time, clinicians have a duty to patients who may be at risk of life-threatening withdrawal if medications are discontinued abruptly. Clinicians should consider seeking the advice of legal counsel, risk management, and health systems administrators in these complex situations. State licensing boards, professional organizations, and clinician malpractice insurance organizations may also have guidance available.

Relation to previous literature and guidance

This systematic review builds on previous reviews by providing the most up-to-date evidence. Previous reviews have been restricted to select interventions, have not adequately differentiated between various types of interventions, have been restricted to older adults, have not provided quantitative synthesis of study results, or have not assessed the certainty of the body of evidence. This review adheres to the highest established standards for producing trustworthy, transparent, and actionable systematic reviews: we assessed the risk of bias of studies, provided quantitative estimates of the effects of interventions, and evaluated the certainty of evidence by using the latest GRADE guidance. Our findings are largely consistent with other reviews. We show that although certain interventions may be effective in increasing the proportion of patients who discontinue BSH, the evidence is overall of low certainty.

Our findings on the effectiveness of tapering contradicts existing guidance that recommends tapering. We show that although tapering increases the number of patients who discontinue BSH, this effect is modest and may not be clinically important. This may partly be attributed to the effects of tapering alone not being sustained in the long term. In our review, we prioritised extracting and synthesising effects at the longest reported point of follow-up. Trials typically reported a reduction in the effects of tapering over time.

Our findings on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy also contrast with those of a previous review that found it to be effective. This discrepancy can be attributed to differences in eligibility criteria and the time point of interest. For example, a previous review reports results for the most positive time point for a trial investigating cognitive behavioural therapy instead of the longest reported point of follow-up. At the longest reported point of follow-up, the data suggest that initial cessation of BSH was not later sustained.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — methodology and key questions reports that "A systematic literature review that considered risks and benefits of BZD tapering as well as patient values and preferences was conducted to inform the development of recommendations". It states that "The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used to develop recommendations in areas with sufficient evidence". The review addressed three questions: "What is the efficacy and/or safety of tapering strategies for BZDs?", "What factors influence the outcomes of BZD tapering and should be monitored?", and "How can shared decision-making and patient-centered health care be utilized to support the effectiveness and safety of BZD tapering?" The process timeline notes "The full draft Guideline was released for public comment in June 2024" and "The final document was approved and/or endorsed by the respective boards of all partner organizations".

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — intended audience and implementation notes that the intended audience is clinicians — including behavioral health professionals, physicians, advanced practice providers, and pharmacists — who prescribe BZDs or provide or support treatment for indications for which BZDs are often prescribed, and it is relevant to diverse settings such as primary care offices, ambulatory care clinics, EDs, hospitals, and outpatient and residential addiction and mental health treatment settings. It adds that some recommendations only apply to specific settings and that clinicians in palliative and end-of-life care are not the intended audience. It clarifies that this Guideline is not intended to be a source of rigid laws, regulations, or policies related to BZD prescribing or tapering and that the recommendations support flexible, patient-centered care. It also states that clinicians should make every effort to promote patients' understanding of and adherence to prescribed and recommended treatment services to improve outcomes, that patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options and welcomed as active partners to shared decision-making, and that recommendations in this Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulations.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113ih89W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

Additional considerations for patients with BZD use disorders are discussed separately in the section " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders".

Recognizing Implementation Challenges

The recommendations in this Guideline are relevant to millions of people in the USA. In 2023, nearly 24 million people in the USA reported use of a BZD, with approximately 20 million reporting use as prescribed. In 2018, an estimated 50% of patients dispensed oral BZD received them for 2 months or longer. Long-term BZD prescribing is also common among older adults, for whom this and other guidelines recommend avoiding BZD use. As clinicians and healthcare systems begin to implement this Guideline, they may identify a large population of patients who would benefit from tapering. We recognize healthcare systems are already overburdened and significant workforce challenges may limit the capacity to manage BZD tapering at scale. Clinicians and healthcare systems may need to identify strategies for prioritizing patients who are at the highest risk of experiencing BZD-related harms in the short term. See " Implementing this Guideline " for further discussion.

Guiding principles for implementation of recommendations from the Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering
The recommendations in this Guideline are intended to support patient-centered care. Many complex factors influence decision-making related to BZD tapering, and there is significant heterogeneity in patient response to tapering. This Guideline should be implemented to allow flexibility in response to diverse clinical circumstances.
Healthcare systems, payers, policymakers, and clinicians should avoid misapplying this Guideline beyond its intended use in ways that may lead to unintentional harms for patients.
Clinicians should develop tapering strategies collaboratively with patients, tailoring strategies to each patient's risks, needs, and preferences, and adjusting strategies based on a patient's response.
Healthcare systems and policymakers should carefully consider how to best leverage existing healthcare resources to meet the needs of the potentially large population for whom BZD tapering may be indicated.
Physical dependence is an expected result of ongoing use of prescribed BZDs and distinct from SUD. Clinicians should not presume that patients with physical dependence have an SUD. Patients with SUD should be managed appropriately (see " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders "), with referrals for specialty treatment as necessary.

Benzodiazepine tapering implementation — level of care and follow-up: Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so. When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed, and should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

Benzodiazepine tapering — implementation considerations: When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process. When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent) and discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) that may be more effective and carry less risk (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia). The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal management — tapering approach is supported by a Strong for recommendation to gradually taper patients off benzodiazepines, as the benefits outweighed the harms and the risks of abrupt cessation far outweigh the benefits. Severe withdrawal symptoms signal a need to slow the tapering process, and an outpatient taper in a primary care setting is often the most feasible. Given the significant risk of seizures with abrupt discontinuation and guidance that a strong recommendation may be warranted when low quality evidence suggests benefit in a life-threatening situation, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

Management of severe or complicated BZD withdrawal — recommendations — state that clinicians should manage such patients "in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g., clinically significant seizure risk, delirium, or unstable vital signs)", and conduct withdrawal management primarily with "Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)" and "Assessments for seizure risk and managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)". For tapering with very long-acting agents, "such as phenobarbital", use "can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation)" and "should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)". Clinicians "should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)".

Benzodiazepine tapering strategies — recommendations for the tapering process specify initial dose-reduction pacing, optional transition to longer-acting medication, individualized adjustments, and monitoring. Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115JbCtu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering recommendations — considerations for tapering benzodiazepines: Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications, at a minimum should assess with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal, and should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should avoid abruptly discontinuing BZD medication in patients who are likely to be physically dependent on BZDs and at risk of BZD withdrawal (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation); tapering is indicated for patients who are likely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation), whereas clinicians should consider either discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), and if significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should develop the BZD tapering strategy in coordination with patients and their care partners in a shared decision-making process whenever possible (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

The Patient Panel noted that some patients may experience significant withdrawal symptoms even when tapering with 5% dose reductions and may benefit from microtapering. No research was identified that addresses this topic. However, existing guidance provides information on microtapering (see Appendix 7 for additional resources).

Taper Duration

Most existing guidance recommend a flexible approach to tapering, reducing the dose at a rate dictated by each patient's ability to tolerate withdrawal symptoms and allowing the process to take as long as patients need. The CGC recognized that the tapering process may take a year or more for patients who have been taking BZDs for a long period of time (e.g. years). This Guideline recommends engaging patients as partners; individualizing tapering strategies to each patient's unique goals, needs, and preferences; and modifying tapering strategies as needed based on a patient's response to the taper.

Follow-Up

A patient's adjustment to BZD discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the BZD to be eliminated from the body. Some patients may experience protracted withdrawal symptoms that can last for months or years after the BZD has been discontinued (see "Management of Protracted Withdrawal"). Although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up with patients after the BZD has been discontinued to monitor for these symptoms and manage them if they do arise. Other patients, particularly those who have been taking BZD for a long time, may be so accustomed to using BZDs to cope with stress and anxiety that they struggle to avoid returning to BZD use. As such, patients may benefit from ongoing monitoring after the tapering process.

Clinicians should educate patients experiencing protracted withdrawal symptoms on the cause of these symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve with time as their brains adjust to the lack of BZD, which may take months. Psychosocial support (e.g. CBT, peer support) may be helpful for patients during this time. Clinicians should avoid reinstating the BZD but can consider prescribing non-BZD medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal symptoms as discussed in the following section.

Patient Safety

The Patient Panel expressed strong reservations about tapering without a patient's consent. The CGC understands the Patient Panel's reservations and encourages clinicians to discuss their concerns that continued BZD use is not in the patient's best interest with the patient and consider the patient's concerns and reasons for disagreement. Clinicians should be mindful of any potential bias when initiating a taper against a patient's wishes. If clinicians and patients and their care partners continue to disagree on the need for a taper after this discussion, clinicians may consider referral for a second opinion.

When initiating a taper without a patient's consent, clinicians should carefully explain the reasons for their decision to the patient and their care partners, if applicable. Clinicians should also carefully document the rationale for initiating the taper and related discussions. Clinicians should then explain to patients that their next prescription will be at a lower dose and describe how they will monitor and manage patient symptoms and concerns during the tapering process. As emphasized throughout this Guideline, the tapering process should be patient-centered. It is important for clinicians to closely monitor a patient's response to the taper and adjust the strategy as appropriate.

Some patients may have negative responses to proceeding with tapering without their buy-in. The CGC noted that, in their collective experience, some patients may become aggressive, threaten legal action, or suggest that progressing with the taper may lead them to suicide. The CGC recommends that healthcare systems have established policies and procedures to guide clinicians in their response to these situations in ways that are responsive to a patient's needs and supports ready access to risk management services.

Implementation considerations for benzodiazepine tapering with SUD — clinicians should refer patients with SUD who are undergoing BZD taper for SUD treatment in parallel with the BZD taper, and care should ideally be coordinated between the clinicians providing SUD treatment and managing the BZD taper; clinicians should consider using existing standards of level of care recommendations such as The ASAM Criteria when considering treatment setting for patients with SUD (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); tapering with phenobarbital should typically be conducted in acute care settings (e.g., hospital or ED) or medically managed residential settings (e.g. The ASAM Criteria Level 3.7), but for patients with SUD may also be conducted in outpatient settings with extended nurse monitoring (e.g. The ASAM Criteria Level 2.7) or with consultation from clinicians experienced in these medications; clinicians can consider using toxicology testing to support risk–benefit assessments if indicated. Some patients with BZD use disorder may be able to successfully taper the BZD in outpatient settings, whereas others taking very high doses and/or using other substances may require a more intensive level of care.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117Jxcqf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine risk–benefit assessment and misuse screening — clinicians should first consider the risks and benefits of continued benzodiazepine (BZD) use, and if the risks outweigh the benefits, clinicians should then consider the potential risks associated with tapering. Risk–benefit assessments should include regular screening for signs of BZD misuse and use disorder; if patients exhibit signs of potential BZD misuse (such as frequently requesting early refills, increased dosage, or number of pills), clinicians should assess the possibility of BZD misuse, related risks, and if tapering is indicated, and drug testing may help differentiate between medication misuse and diversion; patients who are misusing medications should be assessed or referred for further assessment and treatment for potential BZD use disorder. When determining the balance of risks and benefits, the page lists guiding questions regarding benefits of ongoing prescribing versus taper, the significance and imminence of risks and ability to manage them, and whether alternative interventions could achieve similar benefits, and notes that risks evolve with age and with changes in health, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, nicotine/tobacco use, and other medications.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^116xHLB8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

Tapering Versus Discontinuation

If the clinician determines, in the context of the risk/benefit assessment and shared decision-making, continuing the BZD prescription is no longer appropriate, they need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal. The risk of severe withdrawal syndrome following regular use of therapeutic doses of BZD has been recognized since the 1960 s. Factors including use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment contribute to a higher likelihood of physical dependence and risk of severe withdrawal.

If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued. While limited evidence was found comparing tapering strategies, the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation. Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias. Although labeled "gradual", the taper duration was only 7–8 days. There was no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion between groups. However, patients in the tapering group reported significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks, compared to patients who abruptly stopped their BZD use. In discussing these studies, the CGC agreed that benefits of tapering are likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies. See Table 1 in Supplementary Material 5 for the full Evidence to Decision Table comprising these studies.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk factors for severe withdrawal and implications for taper pace — "The development of more severe BZD withdrawal symptoms is associated with use of BZDs with a shorter half-life and fewer active metabolites (e.g., alprazolam), daily use, higher total daily dose, longer duration of use, and history of severe withdrawal". Accordingly, "A slower initial pace of BZD tapering is likely to be safer and more effective for patients who have a high likelihood of physical dependence and significant risk of withdrawal", and "patients should be involved in determining the initial and ongoing tapering pace with clinicians, with the pace ideally agreed upon in a shared decision-making process". The guideline also notes that psychiatric comorbidity complicates tapering: "The presence of certain psychiatric symptoms has been associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms", with examples including "higher levels of anxiety" and personality disorder traits that "often experience considerable difficulty discontinuing BZDs".
