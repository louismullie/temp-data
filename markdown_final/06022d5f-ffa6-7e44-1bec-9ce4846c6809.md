## Question

A 9-year-old girl presents with daily fevers, evanescent rash, and arthritis involving her wrists and knees. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated inflammatory markers, but there is no evidence of macrophage activation syndrome. She is diagnosed with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA). The pediatric rheumatology team is considering initial therapy. One team member suggests starting methotrexate monotherapy as the first-line treatment.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the appropriate initial disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) strategy for this patient, and should conventional synthetic DMARD monotherapy (such as methotrexate) be used as initial therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methotrexate monotherapy is appropriate as initial therapy for a 9-year-old with new-onset systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) without macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and what the guideline-concordant first-line DMARD strategy should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current, authoritative guideline recommendations for SoJIA without MAS. Then, I should verify how these recommendations differ from older guidance and why. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic rationale that supports the preferred agents. After that, I should review real-world and comparative effectiveness data that inform outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and confirm any exceptions or caveats, including what to do if biologics are not accessible or contraindicated [^04ea3d41] [^1f39d4ea].

> Let me first confirm the current standard of care. The 2021 ACR guideline for systemic JIA without MAS makes a strong recommendation against conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) monotherapy, including methotrexate, as initial treatment, and instead conditionally recommends biologic DMARDs targeting IL-1 or IL-6 as initial monotherapy, with no preferred agent specified, while NSAIDs may be considered as a brief initial monotherapy in select cases [^04ea3d41] [^1f39d4ea] [^25b169ed] [^06d9a5e7].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale so I don't jump to conclusions. SoJIA is driven by innate immune dysregulation with prominent IL-1 and IL-6 cytokine pathways, which explains why IL-1 and IL-6 blockade is particularly effective for both systemic and articular disease, whereas methotrexate, a csDMARD with a different mechanism, is less effective for the systemic features and often insufficient as monotherapy in SoJIA [^be56ecfa] [^04ea3d41].

> I should double-check how this differs from older guidance. Earlier ACR recommendations allowed methotrexate or leflunomide in certain scenarios, but those older statements predate the robust IL-1/IL-6 inhibitor data and the 2021 update's explicit shift away from csDMARD monotherapy in SoJIA without MAS; thus, the 2021 guideline supersedes prior advice for initial therapy in this phenotype [^a183d5dd] [^04ea3d41].

> Next, I should review real-world effectiveness signals that align with this shift. Observational data from CARRA's FROST study show that most new-onset SoJIA patients now start with biologics and achieve high rates of clinical inactive disease at 9 months with less glucocorticoid exposure, supporting the modern preference for IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors as first-line therapy in routine practice [^ba73af61] [^6710e5c5].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of NSAIDs and steroids so I don't overstate biologics. NSAIDs can be used briefly as initial monotherapy in mild cases, but they are not disease-modifying; systemic glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as initial monotherapy in SoJIA without MAS because of long-term toxicity, though they may be used short term for severe systemic features while arranging biologic therapy, and they should be tapered promptly once control is achieved [^06d9a5e7] [^08cb1802] [^8447069c].

> Let me consider the practical first-line options and dosing pragmatics. IL-1 inhibitors such as anakinra or canakinumab and the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab are all acceptable initial choices; selection can be individualized based on access, comorbidity, and patient preference, and some clinicians favor anakinra for rapid onset when systemic features predominate, while tocilizumab is also effective for both systemic and articular disease; there is no guideline-preferred agent among IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors [^25b169ed] [^1f39d4ea].

> But wait, what if biologics are not available or contraindicated? I need to ensure I address this. If biologics are inaccessible, some clinicians may still use methotrexate with close monitoring, recognizing it is not the guideline-preferred initial strategy and may be less effective for systemic features; in such cases, escalation to IL-1/IL-6 blockade should be pursued as soon as feasible, and combination therapy with csDMARD plus biologic can be considered for prominent arthritis once biologics are available [^836e6afe] [^04ea3d41].

> I should confirm the bottom line and make it actionable. Methotrexate monotherapy should not be used as initial therapy for SoJIA without MAS; the appropriate first-line DMARD strategy is an IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitor as monotherapy, with NSAIDs considered only as a brief, non–disease-modifying bridge in select mild cases, and glucocorticoids avoided as initial monotherapy while being minimized overall; this approach is supported by current ACR guidelines and contemporary observational data showing improved outcomes with early biologic use and reduced steroid exposure [^04ea3d41] [^1f39d4ea] [^ba73af61].

Methotrexate monotherapy is **not recommended as initial therapy** for systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) without macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [^04ea3d41]. Current ACR guidelines strongly recommend **IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors as first-line therapy** [^25b169ed] because they more effectively control systemic inflammation and prevent joint damage [^be56ecfa]. Methotrexate may be considered only as adjunct therapy for persistent arthritis or when biologics are unavailable, but it should not be used as initial monotherapy [^836e6afe] [^04ea3d41].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

The 2021 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for initial therapy in sJIA without MAS:

- **Biologic DMARDs (IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors)**: Conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy [^25b169ed] [^1f39d4ea].
- **Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)**: Strongly recommended against as initial monotherapy [^04ea3d41] [^836e6afe].
- **NSAIDs**: Conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy for mild systemic symptoms [^06d9a5e7] [^08cb1802].
- **Glucocorticoids**: Conditionally recommended against as initial monotherapy [^08cb1802] [^1f39d4ea].

These recommendations reflect the **distinct pathophysiology** of sJIA, characterized by innate immune dysregulation and elevated IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines [^be56ecfa]. Biologic agents targeting these cytokines have demonstrated superior efficacy in controlling systemic inflammation and preventing joint damage compared to csDMARDs [^be56ecfa].

---

## Evidence supporting biologic therapy over methotrexate monotherapy

Several studies and reviews have highlighted the **superiority of biologic therapy** over methotrexate monotherapy in sJIA:

- **IL-1 inhibitors (e.g. anakinra)**: Rapidly control systemic symptoms, including fever and rash, and reduce joint inflammation [^be56ecfa].
- **IL-6 inhibitors (e.g. tocilizumab)**: Effective in controlling both systemic and articular manifestations, with sustained clinical remission observed in many patients [^f74dc2b2].
- **Methotrexate**: Limited efficacy in controlling systemic inflammation, with slower onset of action and less effective in preventing joint damage [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety considerations

Biologic therapy has been associated with **improved clinical outcomes**, including faster achievement of inactive disease, reduced glucocorticoid dependence, and lower risk of disease flares [^ba73af61]. Safety profiles of IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are generally favorable, with monitoring for potential adverse effects such as infection risk and laboratory abnormalities [^notfound].

In contrast, methotrexate monotherapy may lead to **prolonged disease activity**, increased risk of joint damage, and greater reliance on systemic glucocorticoids, which carry significant long-term risks, including growth suppression, osteoporosis, and immunosuppression [^3c61eaa2].

---

## Clinical scenarios where methotrexate may be considered

While methotrexate monotherapy is not recommended as initial therapy, it may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Adjunctive therapy**: For persistent arthritis despite adequate control of systemic symptoms with biologic therapy [^836e6afe] [^a0e7a003].
- **Limited access to biologics**: In settings where biologic therapy is unavailable or contraindicated, methotrexate may be used as an alternative, albeit with limited efficacy [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Methotrexate may be combined with biologic therapy in cases of severe or refractory arthritis [^836e6afe].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Methotrexate monotherapy is **not recommended as initial therapy** for sJIA without MAS [^04ea3d41]. Current ACR guidelines strongly recommend IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors as first-line therapy due to their superior efficacy in controlling systemic inflammation and preventing joint damage [^25b169ed]. Methotrexate may be considered only as adjunctive therapy or when biologics are unavailable, but it should not be used as initial monotherapy [^836e6afe].

Introduction

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatological disease in children and a cause of childhood disability. The global prevalence of JIA is approximately 19.4 per 100 000 for girls and 11.0 per 100 000 for boys.The cause of childhood arthritis is unknown, and the current understanding of the disease aetiology and pathogenesis are limited.Achieving inactive disease earlier was found to be associated with less joint damage and functional impairment.The advent of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), particularly biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), in the past two decades have revolutionised the treatment approaches to JIA, making it possible to target for inactive disease as the treatment goal. Despite the advanced DMARD treatment, still about 50% of the patients with JIA failed to achieve inactive disease during long-term follow-up,and most of them had detectable joint damage.Recent treatment guidelines recommend adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs), such as the consensus treatment plansand treat-to-target strategiesfor JIA. Similar ATS are recommended for adults with rheumatoid arthritis.These ATSs adjust treatment based on patient’s disease activity and response to the previous treatments.

Currently, the conventional treatment practice is to treat patients on the conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) first and only introduce bDMARDs if poor prognoses are present. Alternatively, a more aggressive approach is to take the early combination of csDMARDs and bDMARDs (cs+bDMARDs) approach first, then tapering off or stop a medication after the disease activity is brought under control. Evidence from randomised control trials (RCTs) suggests early aggressive use of bDMARDs in combination with methotrexate works better than methotrexate alone in achieving early clinical responses.However, real-world evidence of clinical effectiveness is lacking.

This study aims to evaluate real-world evidence on the effectiveness of early aggressive use of cs+bDMARD versus the conservative strategy of using bDMARD later following the initial prescription(s) in treating children with newly diagnosed polyarticular course JIA (pcJIA).

### Treatment of non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^96fdcbb0]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

In the past two decades, the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has evolved markedly, owing to the availability of a growing number of novel, potent and relatively safe therapeutic agents and the shift of management strategies towards early achievement of disease remission. However, JIA encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases that require distinct treatment approaches. Furthermore, some old drugs, such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine and intraarticular glucocorticoids, still maintain an important therapeutic role. In the past 5 years, information on the efficacy and safety of drug therapies for JIA has been further enriched through the accomplishment of several randomized controlled trials of newer biologic and synthetic targeted DMARDs. In addition, a more rational therapeutic approach has been fostered by the promulgation of therapeutic recommendations and guidelines. A multinational collaborative effort has led to the development of the recommendations for the treat-to-target strategy in JIA. There is currently increasing interest in establishing the optimal time and modality for discontinuation of treatment in children with JIA who achieve sustained clinical remission. The aim of this Review is to summarize the current evidence and discuss the therapeutic approaches to the management of non-systemic phenotypes of JIA, including oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

Research strategy and evidence selection

We obtained 843 references in our literature search. Among these, we selected 209 relevant references, of which 33 were clinical trials, 51 reviews, 1 Cochrane meta-analysis and 124 articles of other types.

A total of 472 references were excluded because they were judged not to be relevant, 139 because the studies were mainly about biologic drugs and there was an insufficient focus on MTX, and 23 because they were published in non-European languages. Six articles (2 clinical trials, 1 review, and 3 articles of other types) were subsequently included from an updated literature search (28 February 2017). A flow diagram of the study selection process is shown in Fig. 1.

Discussion

Although MTX is accepted as the most effective non-biologic agent for the treatment of patients with JIA, there is a wide variability in everyday practice in the use of MTX in the management of JIA. Therefore, the adoption of a consensus approach by a group of practitioners expert in the use of the drug in treating patients with JIA has the potential to guide clinicians and improve the understanding and management of this condition.

The recommendations presented in these consensus guidelines developed by the panel of experts participating in the MARAJIA Expert Consensus Meeting are based on a high level of evidence provided in large measure by robust data from randomized controlled clinical trials. Based on a set of key clinical issues developed using the PICO system and a rigorous approach to evidence review and the formulation of the research questions adopted to reduce the introduction of biases and to ensure balanced and evidence-based recommendations, we identified sound scientific support to guide the use of MTX in patients with JIA. Our consensus-based analysis integrated the scientific evidence from the literature with clinical experience to provide a set of recommendations we believe are of value in helping clinicians optimize the treatment of their patients with a diagnosis of JIA.

Conclusions

All treatment strategies show significant improvement from the baseline. The study results suggest that, compared with csDMARD only, early aggressive use of bDMARD in treating patients with pcJIA soon after diagnosis achieves more than two points of additional reduction in disease activity at 6 months. Adding bDMARD after 6 months to the initial treatment provides very little added benefit. Future studies are needed to investigate the long-term clinical and health-related quality-of-life outcomes.

### Biologic switching patterns among children with non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^5672eb60]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease with the onset in childhood. JIA is an umbrella term of chronic arthropathies which, if left untreated, may lead to severe disability and impaired health-related quality of life. Since JIA is a chronic disease with no available curative drug, the overall goal of treatment is to achieve remission or at least minimal disease activity, to prevent joint damage enabling normal development and growth of the child.

The advent of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting specific cytokines or intercellular interactions at the beginning of this millennium has revolutionized the outcome of JIA. A growing number of bDMARDs have now proven their efficacy in a number of randomized controlled trials. According to the 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines, tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFis) are recommended for non-systemic JIA as an add-on treatment when moderate or high disease activity is present three months after initiation of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), or in case of persistent low disease activity six months after initiation of csDMARDs. The recommendations have recently been revised, pointing out that bDMARDs may be appropriate as initial therapy (skipping the prior csDMARD) in children with polyarthritis and involvement of high-risk joints and/or high disease activity.

### Successful treatment with tocilizumab every 4 weeks of a low disease activity group who achieve a drug-free remission in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^540f070b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In our study we have shown a comparative efficacy of different TCZ protocols based on clinical heterogeneity of SoJIA patients. We offer a set of provisional criteria that may help differentiate patients with favorable and unfavorable disease courses and allow TCZ treatment every 4 weeks for the patients with the more favorable prognosis instead of the more aggressive every 2 week regimen. Our criteria may help increase the probability of a child with SoJIA reaching remission off of TCZ without the expense and potential side-effects of using TCZ every 2 weeks.

Ethics

Written consent was obtained according to the declaration of Helsinki. Approval of the protocol of this trial was approved by local Ethic Committee of Saint-Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) oligoarthritis—initial pharmacologic approach: Oral glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis; if used despite recommendations against when an IAGC is not available or feasible or prior to the onset of action of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. After inadequate response to scheduled nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or IAGCs, conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) are strongly recommended, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended as a preferred agent over leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine (in that order).

### Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^be56ecfa]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) is a systemic inflammatory disease which has up to now been classified as a category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, in this context, systemic inflammation has been associated with dysregulation of the innate immune system, suggesting that it may rather be part of the spectrum of autoinflammatory disorders. The disease is in fact unique with regard to the other JIA categories, in terms of clinical manifestations, prognosis, and response to conventional immunosuppressant therapies. It is characterized clinically by fever, lymphadenopathy, arthritis, rash, and serositis. IL-1 and IL-6 play a major role in the pathogenesis of SoJIA, and treatment with IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors has shown to be highly effective. However, complications of SoJIA, including macrophage activation syndrome, limitations in functional outcome by arthritis and long-term damage from chronic inflammation continue to be a major issue in patients' care. Recent advances on the pathogenesis and treatment have revolutionized the care and prognosis of this potentially life-threatening pediatric condition.

### Management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: hitting the target [^08b36989]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is evolving. The growing number of effective drugs has led to successful treatment and prevention of long-term sequelae in most patients. Although patients with JIA frequently achieve lasting clinical remission, sustained remission off medication is still elusive for most. Treatment approaches vary substantially among paediatric rheumatologists owing to the inherent heterogeneity of JIA and, until recently, to the lack of accepted and well-evidenced guidelines. Furthermore, many pertinent questions related to patient management remain unanswered, in particular regarding treatment targets, and selection, intensity and sequence of initiation or withdrawal of therapy. Existing JIA guidelines and recommendations do not specify treat-to-target or tight control strategies, in contrast to adult rheumatology in which these approaches have been successful. The concepts of window of opportunity (early treatment to improve long-term outcomes) and immunological remission (abrogation of subclinical disease activity) are also fundamental when defining treatment methodologies. This Review explores the application of these concepts to JIA and their possible contribution to the development of future clinical guidelines or consensus treatment protocols. The article also discusses how diverse forms of standardized, guideline-led care and personalized treatment can be combined into a targeted, patient-centred approach to optimize management strategies for patients with JIA.

### A comparison of three treatment strategies in recent onset non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: initial 3-months results of the BeSt for kids-study [^3659ef63]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with prednisone or etanercept may induce earlier and/or more improvement in disease activity in Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) naïve non-systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients. Here we present three months clinical outcome of initial treatments of the BeSt-for-Kids study.

Methods

Included patients were randomized to either: 1. initial DMARD-monotherapy (sulfasalazine (SSZ) or methotrexate (MTX)), 2. Initial MTX / prednisolone-bridging, 3. Initial combination MTX/etanercept. Percentage inactive disease, adjusted (a) ACR Pedi30, 50 and 70 and JADAS after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment (intention to treat analysis) and side effects are reported.

Results

94 patients (67% girls, 32 (arm 1), 32 (arm 2) and 30 (arm 3) with median (InterQuartileRange) age of 9.1 (4.7-12.9) years were included. 38% were ANA positive, 10 had oligo-articular disease, 68 polyarticular JIA and 16 psoriatic arthritis. Baseline median (IQR) ACRpedi-scores: VAS physician 49 (40-58) mm, VAS patient 54 (37-70) mm, ESR 6.5 (2-14.8)mm/hr, active joint count 8 (5-12), limited joint count 3 (1-5), CHAQ score 0.88 (0.63-1.5). In arm 1, 17 started with MTX, 15 with SSZ. After 3 months, aACR Pedi 50 was reached by 10/32 (31%), 12/32(38%) and 16/30 (53%) (p=0.19) and aACR Pedi 70 was reached by 8/32 (25%), 6/32(19%) and 14/30(47%) in arms 1-3 (p=0.04). Toxicity was similar. Few serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

After 3 months of treatment in a randomized trial, patients with recent-onset JIA achieved significantly more clinical improvement (aACRPedi70) on initial combination therapy with MTX / etanercept than on initial MTX or SSZ monotherapy.

Conclusions

These consensus recommendations relating to the efficacy, optimal dosing and route of administration and duration of treatment with MTX in JIA, and to the important issues of folic acid supplementation to prevent MTX side effects, use of MTX in the treatment of chronic JIA-associated uveitis, combination treatment with biologic agents, and the use of vaccinations in patients with JIA provide balanced and evidence-based recommendations designed to have broad value for physicians and healthcare clinicians. We did not at this time find sufficient evidence to justify pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic analysis prior to MTX treatment in current clinical practice, as insufficient evidence is available on biomarkers able to predict treatment response.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that a conventional treatment regimen based on the use of MTX as the sole DMARD led to the achievement of ID in a sizeable proportion of children with JIA. Patients with systemic arthritis, ERA and polyarthritis with increased CRP were less likely to achieve ID. These findings help to outline the characteristics of JIA patients who may deserve the prescription of a synthetic DMARD other than MTX or the introduction of a biologic DMARD from the disease outset.

### Looking for the best strategy to treat children with new onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis: presentation of the "comparison of STep-up and step-down therapeutic strategies in childhood ARthritiS" (STARS) trial [^f5fcae5b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although a satisfactory disease control is nowadays achievable in most patients with JIA, a substantial proportion of them still do not respond adequately or reach long-term drug-free remission. According to current recommendations, treatment should be escalated in subsequent steps. A different approach is based on the assumption that the initial start of an aggressive therapy may take advantage of the "window of opportunity" and could alter the biology of the disease, leading to an improvement of long-term outcomes, including the prevention of cumulative joint damage.

Objectives

This randomised clinical trial aims to compare the effectiveness of a conventional therapeutic regimen, based on treatment escalation and driven by the treat-to-target approach, with that of an early aggressive intervention based on the initial start of a combination of conventional and biological DMARDs.

Methods

JIA patients with oligoarthritis or RF negative polyarthritis aged more than 2years and with less than 4months of disease course will be included in the study. Children will be randomised into two arms: patients in Step-up arm with less severe oligoarthritis will undergo an intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) in all affected joints; patients with polyarthritis or severe oligoarthritis will receive IACI and methotrexate. Subsequent treatment will follow a standardised protocol based on the patients' level of disease activity measured with the JADAS, according to a treat-to-target strategy. Patients in Step-down arm will receive a 6-month early combined treatment (methotrexate plus IACI for less severe oligoarthritis, methotrexate plus etanercept for severe oligoarthritis and polyarthritis). The primary endpoint is the frequency of achievement of the status of clinical remission (i.e. persistence of inactive disease for at least 6 months) at the 12-month visit. Safety events, physician-centred measures and parent/patient-reported outcomes will be collected through the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation on line database.

Expected Results

The STARS trial aims to provide important evidence supporting the first-line treatment choices in the care of children with oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA. If the superiority of an early aggressive therapy will be demonstrated, this will demand further studies on the biological definition of the window of opportunity for JIA.

Trial Registration

The Trial is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT03728478) on the 31st October 2018 and EU Clinical Trials Register on the 14th May 2018 (EudraCT Number: 2018-001931-27).

Introduction: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic and heterogeneous disease causing structural changes in the joints. Treatment aims to stop inflammation, relieve pain, maintain joint function, prevent damage, and suppress disease activity. As treatment options increase, maintenance of drug-free inactive disease (ID) has gained more importance. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most commonly used agent among synthetic DMARDs in JIA. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on how and when to stop MTX to maintain drug-free remission after ID. Factors that increase the risk of flare, apart from the drug withdrawal strategy are also unclear.

Objectives: To determine the factors that increase the risk of disease flare in patients with JIA who stopped MTX monotherapy following inactive disease.

Methods: Files of all JIA cases between 1992-2022 were examined retrospectively. Patients who stopped MTX monotherapy following inactive disease were evaluated. Patients with disease flare and ongoing ID were compared.

Demographic data, JIA subgroup, age of disease onset, autoantibodies, acute phase reactants, MTX dose and administration route, MTX discontinuation method, and time interval were recorded.

Results: Among the files of 1,036 patients with JIA, a total of 333 patients were identified as MTX monotherapy, and ID was achieved in 138 (41.5%). Among 138 patients, 105 (76%) were female and median age was 5.8 years. Oligoarticular JIA was the most frequent type. Other subtypes included polyarticular JIA, systemic-onset JIA (SoJIA), and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JpsA) (Table-1). Patients reached ID in median 7.9 months after starting MTX, and MTX treatment was discontinued median 1.02 year after ID.

### Consensus treatment plans for new-onset systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^5eac34bb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

There is wide variation in therapeutic approaches to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) among North American rheumatologists. Understanding the comparative effectiveness of the diverse therapeutic options available for treatment of systemic JIA can result in better health outcomes. The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) developed consensus treatment plans and standardized assessment schedules for use in clinical practice to facilitate such studies.

Methods

Case-based surveys were administered to CARRA members to identify prevailing treatments for new-onset systemic JIA. A 2-day consensus conference in April 2010 employed modified nominal group technique to formulate preliminary treatment plans and determine important data elements for collection. Followup surveys were employed to refine the plans and assess clinical acceptability.

Results

The initial case-based survey identified significant variability among current treatment approaches for new-onset systemic JIA, underscoring the utility of standardized plans to evaluate comparative effectiveness. We developed 4 consensus treatment plans for the first 9 months of therapy, as well as case definitions and clinical and laboratory monitoring schedules. The 4 treatment regimens included glucocorticoids only, or therapy with methotrexate, anakinra, or tocilizumab, with or without glucocorticoids. This approach was approved by >78% of the CARRA membership.

Conclusion

Four standardized treatment plans were developed for new-onset systemic JIA. Coupled with data collection at defined intervals, use of these treatment plans will create the opportunity to evaluate comparative effectiveness in an observational setting to optimize initial management of systemic JIA.

### Does triple conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy improve upon methotrexate as the initial treatment of choice for a rheumatoid arthritis patient? [^fbba68b6]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although many treatment options exist for the initial management of rheumatoid arthritis, there has long been discussion about whether initial treatment should be with methotrexate (MTX) as monotherapy or in combination with other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Although studies initially showed additional benefit from combining MTX with other csDMARDs, this benefit disappears when glucocorticoids are added to MTX, a strategy recommended in current guidelines as a short-term bridging approach until MTX therapy exhibits its full efficacy. Also concomitant use of glucocorticoids, with MTX may not be inferior to combination therapy of MTX with TNF-inhibitors.

### Clinical remission rate and drug withdrawal status in articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^abf182f7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is classified into the following disease categories according to the revised International League Against Rheumatism classification criteria. Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (OJIA) affects up to four joints within 6 months after onset and is further divided into two types: extended (progression to five or more affected joints beyond 6 months after onset) and persistent (up to four affected joints throughout the entire course of the disease). Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) is a form of JIA with five or more affected joints within 6 months after onset, which is further divided into rheumatoid factor-negative (RF −) and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF +) PJIA based on the presence or absence of RF. Other categories include psoriatic arthritis (PsA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), and undifferentiated arthritis.

The Japan College of Rheumatology has published guidelines for the initial treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). The treatment for articular JIA includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX), glucocorticoids (GC) administered systemically or via intra-articular injection, and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as tocilizumab (TCZ), adalimumab (ADA) and etanercept (ETN). MTX is recommended as the initial treatment for high-risk groups. The high-risk group is defined by meeting one or more of the following conditions: 1) positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) or rheumatoid factor (RF); 2) elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein levels or erythrocyte sedimentation rate twice the normal level) accompanied by arthritis in the hand or ankle; 3) presence of cervical or hip lesions; 4) imaging showing bone destruction and bone marrow edema. If clinical remission is not achieved following initial treatment with MTX, the introduction of bDMARDs is recommended.

### Successful treatment with tocilizumab every 4 weeks of a low disease activity group who achieve a drug-free remission in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^ee808910]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) is the most striking form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical responses and outcomes of children with SoJIA to IL-6 blockade using two different tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment protocols designed for milder and more severe SoJIA patient groups, and evaluate the possibility of achieving biologic-free remission.

Methods

Thirty-seven active SoJIA children who have failed treatment with corticosteroids and other DMARDs were included in our retrospective study. TCZ doses were prescribed in two treatment approaches: every 2 weeks TCZ dosing (Q2W) and every 4 weeks TCZ dosing (Q4W). The patients were assigned to these two groups by the study physicians depending on the severity of the SoJIA disease as judged by each clinician.

Results

Thirty-three of the 37 children successfully completed the trial. TCZ was discontinued in 11patients during the trial. Seven children achieved inactive disease and were allowed to stop the TCZ and 4 had severe adverse events requiring drug cessation. Currently 7 patients continue to have TCZ-free remission [4/7 remission off-medication, 3/7still on methotrexate (MTX)]. This mixed group had a median treatment duration of 1002 days. The children in remission off of all medications, TCZ and MTX, had a median remission duration of 1162 days (ranged 932-1301 days). Compared to the patients assigned to the Q2W TCZ treatment group, the patients assigned to the Q4W TCZ group had a milder SoJIA course. The patients had higher levels of hemoglobin, total proteins, and serum albumins. They had lower white blood cell counts (WBC), % granulocytes, CRP, ESR, ferritins, and LDH. These children had a lower frequency of internal organ involvement, fewer relapses during TCZ treatment, and no macrophage activation syndrome episodes.

Conclusions

Our experience with TCZ for SoJIA supports the excellent result of other studies. What may be novel is our finding that thisIL-6 blockade with TCZ may be able to be utilized at a less frequent dosing schedule in mild SoJIA compared to severe SoJIA. We discuss other factors that may increase the probability of a patient reaching TCZ-free remission.

### Treatment guidelines in rheumatoid arthritis [^8caa58b1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^8774f0c0]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Two retrospective cohort studies recommended completion of a maximal response timeframe and to achieve the maximum effective dose by the parenteral route before considering combination therapy.

Studies in adult patients with RA revealed a superiority of combining MTX and etanercept versus MTX only. This combination has also been successfully used in children and adolescents, despite a lack of double-blind, randomized controlled trials.

A 3-year, open-label, prospective multicenter study of children and adolescents (aged 2–18 years) with polyarticular, systemic, or extended oligoarticular JIA receiving MTX (n = 197), etanercept (n = 103), or both (n = 294) showed good safety and efficacy in all three groups. The results of this study indicated that patients with polyarticular (RF-positive or negative) or systemic JIA benefit from etanercept or etanercept plus MTX treatment. Improvements in joint counts and physician’s global assessment scores were similar across three different arms, and improvements were maintained for three years in those continuing to receive medication.

In a randomized, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, multicenter, medication-withdrawal study with a 16-week open-label lead-in phase, a 32-week double-blind withdrawal phase, and an open-label extension phase, 171 children with active juvenile rheumatoid arthritis underwent stratification according to MTX use (85 patients receiving MTX, 86 not receiving MTX) and received adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. Subsequently, those that had an ACR Pediatric 30% (ACR Pedi 30) response at week 16 (74% of patients not receiving MTX and 94% of those receiving MTX) were randomly assigned to receive adalimumab or placebo in a double-blind fashion every other week for up to 32 weeks. At 48 weeks, the percentages of patients treated with MTX who had ACR Pedi 30, 50, 70, or 90 responses were significantly greater for those receiving adalimumab than for those receiving placebo; the differences between patients not treated with MTX who received adalimumab and those who received placebo were not significant. The study was not statistically powered to detect differences between patients receiving and those not receiving MTX; however, the proportions of patients with ACR Pedi 30, 50, 70, or 90 responses were somewhat higher among those receiving adalimumab in combination with MTX than among those receiving adalimumab without MTX.

### First-line options for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis treatment: an observational study of childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance consensus treatment plans [^ba73af61]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) developed consensus treatment plans (CTPs) to compare treatment initiation strategies for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). First-line options for sJIA treatment (FROST) was a prospective observational study to assess CTP outcomes using the CARRA Registry.

Methods

Patients with new-onset sJIA were enrolled if they received initial treatment according to the biologic CTPs (IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitor) or non-biologic CTPs (glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy or methotrexate). CTPs could be used with or without systemic GC. Primary outcome was achievement of clinical inactive disease (CID) at 9months without current use of GC. Due to the small numbers of patients in the non-biologic CTPs, no statistical comparisons were made between the CTPs.

Results

Seventy-three patients were enrolled: 63 (86%) in the biologic CTPs and 10 (14%) in the non-biologic CTPs. CTP choice appeared to be strongly influenced by physician preference. During the first month of follow-up, oral GC use was observed in 54% of biologic CTP patients and 90% of non-biologic CTPs patients. Five (50%) non-biologic CTP patients subsequently received biologics within 4months of follow-up. Overall, 30/53 (57%) of patients achieved CID at 9months without current GC use.

Conclusion

Nearly all patients received treatment with biologics during the study period, and 46% of biologic CTP patients did not receive oral GC within the first month of treatment. The majority of patients had favorable short-term clinical outcomes. Increased use of biologics and decreased use of GC may lead to improved outcomes in sJIA.

### Real-world effectiveness of common treatment strategies for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: results from a Canadian cohort [^29df0c82]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Undervaluing the effectiveness of conventional treatments may lead to overtreatment with biologic medications in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Using data from a nationwide inception cohort and strict methods to control bias, the aim of our study was to estimate the real-world effectiveness of simple JIA treatment strategies recommended in current guidelines.

Methods

Children with JIA who were recruited at 16 Canadian centers from 2005 to 2010 were followed for up to 5 years. For each child, all observed treatment changes over time were assessed by independent physicians using prospectively collected data and published response criteria. Success was defined as attainment of inactive disease or maintenance of this state when stepping down treatment; minimally active disease was deemed acceptable for children with polyarticular JIA. Success rates were calculated for treatments tried ≥25 times, and logistic regression analysis identified features associated with success.

Results

A total of 4,429 treatment episodes were observed in 1,352 children. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) monotherapy was attempted 697 times, mostly as initial treatment when <5 joints were involved, with a 54.4% success rate (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 50.3-58.6). NSAIDs plus joint injections had a 64.7% success rate (95% CI 59.8-69.7). Adding methotrexate to NSAIDs and/or joint injections (attempted 566 times) had a 60.5% success rate (95% CI 55.7-65.3). In adjusted analyses, each additional active joint reduced chances of success for treatment with NSAIDs (odds ratio [OR] 0.90 [95% CI 0.85-0.94]) and for methotrexate combinations (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.99]). Each additional year after disease onset reduced chances of success for treatment with methotrexate combinations (OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.72-0.95]).

Conclusion

These real-world effectiveness estimates show that conventional nonbiologic treatment strategies that are recommended in current guidelines are effective in achieving treatment targets in many children with JIA.

(In children with polyarticular JIA, the choice of second-line management (combination of other csDMARDs or using bDMARDs) depends on various factors)

In children with polyarticular JIA, the choice of second-line management depends on various factors, including disease activity, response to initial treatments, and individual patient characteristics and prognostic factors.
One common approach for second-line management is to escalate the dose of the already used DMARDs.
If methotrexate is not tolerated or contraindicated; leflunomide or sulfasalazine could be used if no poor prognostic factors
leflunomide or sulfasalazine could be added on to methotrexate as a second line of treatment if the target is not achieved with methotrexate monotherapy. (combined MTX and leflunomide is still off-label use in JIA due to scanty of data and conflicting results of studies).
Biological therapy could be used as second line of treatment in presence of poor prognostic factors.

### The majority of newly diagnosed patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis reach an inactive disease state within the first year of specialised care: data from a German inception cohort [^6c50aaa8]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Reaching ID is of course no achievement per se; it depends on the treatment that is being administered. The patients followed in ICON were treated relatively intensively with intra-articular steroids in 60%, csDMARDs in 67% and bDMARDs in 22% of cases during the first 14 months of disease. This treatment approach, including the type of substances used, corresponds to current recommendations of treatment in JIA.The therapy of patients with soJIA in ICON reflects this well. BDMARDs that inhibit IL-1 or IL-6 are recommended as the first glucocorticoid sparing therapies for children with active soJIA.These substances, approved for soJIA in Germany in 2011 and 2013, already received more than 80% of the soJIA cases within the first year in ICON. Patients with soJIA were those who achieved most frequently and most rapidly a state of ID during the first months of rheumatology care. However, most of the patients with soJIA were on bDMARD therapy, which was shown to enable such patients to reach ID in most cases.In contrast, patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) reached a state of ID less frequently (55%) and after a mean period of 15.9 months after symptom onset. Only a small proportion of children with ERA received biologics, although it is known that patients with this subtype respond poorly to conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate. This may be at least partially attributable to the licensing situation, with approval of etanercept and adalimumab for use in ERA as recently as 2013 and 2014, respectively. However, a recently published retrospective study found that patients with ERA had attained an ID state least often (24%) in comparison with patients in other JIA categories 1 year after the initiation of the TNF inhibitor.In addition, it has to be kept in mind that the Wallace criteria for ID in JIA do not include a measure for enthesitis and, therefore, may not display all aspects of disease (in)activity in this JIA category. Compared to enrolment in ICON, when 56% of patients with ERA suffered from enthesitis, 16% still had clinically active enthesitis at the 12-month FU. Recently, Weiss et al used data from the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) registry to demonstrate that ERA is associated with higher pain intensity and poorer health status in comparison with other categories of JIA.

### Successful treatment with tocilizumab every 4 weeks of a low disease activity group who achieve a drug-free remission in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^f74dc2b2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) is the most striking forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This challenging disease unchecked may lead to severe joint disability and internal organ involvement and is frequently associated with life-threatening complications such as macrophage activation syndrome and amyloidosis. There are typical SoJIA-related long-term adverse events that have been noted for decades, both from the disease and the treatment with corticosteroids. These include anemia, Cushing’s syndrome, obesity, growth failure, osteoporosis with pathological fractures, aseptic bone necrosis, hypertension as well as metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Due to the failure of corticosteroids (CS) and DMARDs such as MTX to adequately control SoJIA and difficult side effects of these medications in many children, rheumatologists have recently begun treating SoJIA patients with biologic medications despite the high cost of the drugs.

Biologic medications that provide blockade of interleukin-1 (Il-1) and interleukin-6 (Il-6) appear to be most effective current treatment of children with SoJIA in 2014. They provide impressive control of SoJIA disease activity in approximately 2/3’s of patients with SoJIA. The increasing use of these biologics had led to a dramatic improvement in the short-term outcome of SoJIA patients. Unfortunately, Il- 1and IL-6 blockers in many countries are still not available and/or affordable. In our country, the IL-6 blocker is the only biologic drug available for SoJIA management at this time.

Recent studies of the pathophysiology of SoJIA have shown an important role for Il-6 in joint inflammation. IL-6 also appears to have a major factor in systemic features, such as rash, serositis, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplemomegaly. Two major drug trials performed initially by S.Yokota and co-workers in Japan and later in USA and Europe (TENDER trial) have supported the efficacy of IL-6 blockade in SoJIA. Since IL-1 blockers were unavailable in Russia at the time of this study and tocilizumab (TCZ) was registered and approved for adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we have been able to use TCZ off label for treatment of SoJIA, as the only option for management of SoJIA in patients unresponsive to other medications.

Discussion

With the constant development of new effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of JIA the goal of JIA treatment has changed over the last decades. Remission of disease or at least minimal disease activity can be reached in a high percentage of patients and should be the aim of any JIA treatment regime. This aim can be reached with different treatments/treatment strategies. Registry and national core documentation data demonstrate a variety of treatment strategies are applied in clinical routine practice throughout Germany by the early use of Methotrexate as conventional DMARD and of biologics. Actual therapeutic reality however, also include high dose steroid pulses at baseline although the evidence for such a treatment is scarce as well as for multiple intraarticular joint injections.

Standardized approaches to diagnosis and treatment are transparent and are considered to help reaching the treatment target earlier and in a greater proportion of patients than routine unguided care.

With the assumption, that a strict treatment regime with regular critical evaluation of disease activity as the main indicator for effective treatment and resolute modification of treatment in case of inefficacy/insufficient efficacy within determined intervals is superior to individual treatment practices in general, this protocol has been developed. The treating physician/pediatric rheumatologist is not influenced in the choice of treatment, especially the choice of any of the approved biologics. Also effectiveness of different agents varies between patients. Heterogeneity of disease presentations and disease courses should be acknowledged.

A very important question in clinical practice is when to change treatment, if the patient shows insufficient treatment response. For different agents the time to onset of effect has to be taken into account. Over-treatment should be avoided. The measuring of treatment success poses also a challenge and different approaches have been chosen. While the CARRA protocols use the physician global assessment, ability to taper/discontinue steroids as well as a not clearly defined “patient much improved” statement as criteria for treatment success, the 2013 updated ACR recommendations take into account prognostic factors as well as threefold classification of disease activity using the 4 parameters, that are also used in the JADAS. For the present protocol the JADAS as a validated, time-efficient, simple tool for evaluation of treatment efficacy was chosen.

### Early combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate in JIA patients shortens the time to reach an inactive disease state and remission: results of a double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^91fee20b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease characterized by chronic arthritis with no further cause. JIA is a diagnosis of exclusion and embraces a rather heterogeneous patient cohort. Nevertheless, the most pronounced clinical and laboratory manifestations in these patients allow them to be combined into several JIA categories with respect to the International league of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. For several JIA categories, own recommendations for patient management and treatment regimen exist. Patients with polyarticular JIA who have no systemic manifestations can be treated with either non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids (GCs) as the first-line therapy depending on the presence of poor prognosis features. The efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in polyarticular JIA has been demonstrated, and thus, it is recommended as the first disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). However, not all patients respond sufficiently to MTX, and some are intolerant of its side effects. According to international guidelines and recommendations, JIA patients refractory to MTX treatment are eligible for treatment with biologics. In most cases, biologics are prescribed after a patient has already been unsuccessfully treated with other drugs for several months. Approval of biologics such as Adalimumab, Etanercept, Golimumab and Tocilizumab is restricted to polyarticular patients who failed pretreatment with MTX. The current treatment strategies and the sequence of medication switching allow a considerable percentage of patients to achieve long-term remission. However, most questions related to the optimal treatment regimen still need to be solved. Some of these questions have been outlined in the project plan for new ACR guidelines that will be issued in 2021. In particular, the question regarding anti-tumour-necrosis –factor (anti-TNF) drugs (the first-line biologics for treating arthritis without systemic manifestations) consists of choosing between biologic monotherapy and biologic+non-biologic DMARD combination therapy if a biologic needs to be added to the treatment regimen. Identifying patient categories for the optimal treatment choice is also a high-priority task. Furthermore, according to the current clinical guidelines, anti-TNF agents can be prescribed only after the disease activity remains medium or high regardless of MTX treatment for 3–6 months. Such a delay prolongs the time with active arthritis, reduces the current quality of life of patients and their parents and increases the risk of developing irreversible osteoarticular changes. Therefore, a very important issue is related to changing the timing of medication switching or identifying certain subgroups/cohorts of patients for whom early treatment with biologics or combination therapy will be the most effective option. Etanercept (ETA) remains one of the most frequently used anti-TNF drugs for JIA patients. The development and spread of biosimilars also contribute to their wider application. Choosing the optimal regimen of ETA therapy is very relevant for both issues mentioned above. Even for methotrexate, which is the basic therapy option, the relationship between the duration of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment has been demonstrated to be well known. One of the key questions is whether the strategy of waiting for 3–6 months to determine whether MTX monotherapy is ineffective before prescribing ETA is beneficial compared to the simultaneous prescription of a combination treatment at baseline in terms of the time to achieve remission and the long-term outcome. Wallace et al. attempted to demonstrate that early aggressive therapy contributes to the earlier onset of clinically inactive disease. However, in this study, the control group received MTX monotherapy, while the main group received combination MTX + ETA+GCs therapy. That combination made it impossible to assess the efficacy of the biologic itself. Therefore, we planned and conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of two different treatment regimens: ETA+MTX combination therapy vs the standard MTX monotherapy with ETA added subsequently (not earlier than after 12 weeks of MTX monotherapy) in JIA patients without systemic manifestations of disease.

Methods

Study design and patient population

Data were extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) system for 2082 patients with JIA seen at a large US Midwest paediatric rheumatology clinic from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2018. Eligible patients were 1–19 years old, DMARD-naive, and newly diagnosed pcJIA including subtypes of polyarthritis, oligoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enteritis-related arthritis and undifferentiated arthritis according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology.Patient must be diagnosed with pcJIA in at least two distinct visits by paediatric rheumatologists and had a rheumatology clinic visit within 6 months after the diagnosis. Patients with the comorbid conditions of inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and trisomy 21 were excluded.

Treatment

The adaptive treatments (figure 1) were determined based on the concurrent medication prescriptions recorded in the EMR at all clinical encounters. Patients assigned to early aggressive treatment strategy group were those received both bDMARD and csDMARD prescriptions within 2 months. Patients on the conservative comparator group were those initiated on csDMARDs and did not receive any bDMARD in at least 3 months. The time when patients received their first DMARD prescription was the baseline (0 month). The follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months were identified based on patients’ subsequent clinical visits and changes in DMARD prescriptions. Any changes in medication prescriptions were recorded and compared with the previous prescription. Based on the prescription changes, patients were further allocated into the second-stage adaptive groups based on initiation or dropping of bDMARDs by 6 months of follow-up (figure 1).

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis guideline—guiding principles specify scope and key cautions: Consistent with the ACR’s 2019 JIA guidelines, these recommendations are for persons already diagnosed as having JIA. Aside from poor prognostic features specified within the recommendations themselves (e.g., specific joints for oligoarthritis, macrophage activation syndrome [MAS]), coexisting extraarticular conditions that would influence disease management, such as uveitis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel disease, are not addressed within these guidelines. Recommendations are intended to be used by all clinicians caring for persons with JIA and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the recommended pharmacologic treatments. Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy in childhood is not appropriate because of its effects on bone health and growth, and wherever glucocorticoids are suggested, their exposure should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Shared decision-making with families and patients is important when considering treatment options.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis for the general practitioner (...) [^e611573d]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal complaints are common among children in the primary care setting. Joint pain can be categorized as either inflammatory or noninflammatory, and differentiating between these 2 categories affects a physician’s differential diagnosis and plan for evaluation. Patients with inflammatory arthritis will frequently present to the primary care physician with musculoskeletal complaints. Specific features in the history and physical examination distinguish juvenile idiopathic arthritis from other musculoskeletal etiologies. JIA is the most common cause of inflammatory joint pain in children younger than 16 years, with a variable worldwide incidence; in Europe and North America, the incidence is approximately 7. 8 to
8. 3 per 100, 000, with prevalence rates between 12. 8 and 45 per 100,
000. It is thought that as many as 8 million children in the world have chronic arthritis.

Given its prevalence, it is important for the primary care physician to be able to appropriately recognize this condition and in doing so prevent a delay in diagnosis and management. Arthritis is a common cause of disability in children, and complications of JIA can be severe. Many therapies used in JIA have adverse effects and contraindications that require recognition by the primary care physician. This article discusses the differences between inflammatory and noninflammatory joint pain, the diagnosis and various categories of JIA, long-term outcomes and complications associated with JIA, and the general management of JIA with special emphasis on adverse effects and contraindications of therapies.

### Frequency of biologic switching and the outcomes of switching in children and young people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a national cohort study [^32dd5a22]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Until 2015, the prescribing of biological DMARDs in the UK was regulated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, which stated that biologics should be reserved for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, following previous treatment with methotrexate.In 2015, National Health Service (NHS) England published a new treatment pathway for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which still recommended treatment with methotrexate before biological therapy, with the exception of individuals with enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who were recommended to start a TNFi, or individuals with macrophage activation syndrome non-responsive to corticosteroids, who were recommended to initiate treatment with anakinra. After methotrexate, the majority of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis should start an initial TNFi, except those with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who are recommended to start tocilizumab. After an initial biologic is ineffective, patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis can switch to anakinra, whereas all other patients are recommended to start a second TNFi, with the exception of patients who are positive for rheumatoid factor, who are recommended to start rituximab.

With the increasing availability of other biologic classes, the proportion of children and young people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are switching between biologics remains unclear. A better understanding of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who switch biologic drugs multiple times is vital to better inform future treatment guidelines and health economic evaluations. Additionally, although it is recognised that children are switching between biologics, no data are available to inform prescribing after patients do not respond to treatment with a first biologic, usually a TNFi. As a result of the paucity of real-world evidence, at present two conflicting recommendations exist for patients when switching to a second biologic due to ineffectiveness of an initial TNFi: 2015 NHS England guidelinessuggest treatment with a second TNFi and 2019 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelinessuggest treatment with a different class of biologic. The use of real-world data to identify the optimum choice of second biologic is methodologically challenging because of the potential of confounding by indication; patients might be prescribed a certain biological therapy due to their characteristics (ie, systemic features, disease severity), and thus comparing the treatments might be confounded by these characteristics. Therefore, careful statistical approaches must be considered.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis guideline—clinical conclusions and research needs center on evidence gaps and individualized care: Head-to-head trials are needed to understand the optimal order and roles of csDMARDs and bDMARDs for children with JIA, and biosimilars were not addressed in this guideline due to no available evidence assessing their use in JIA. To facilitate individualization, no rigid time frames were required for an advancement of treatment; moving quickly may be needed for a patient whose condition is rapidly worsening, while moving more slowly may be appropriate for one whose condition has improved substantially but not fully, and panel participants emphasized the critical importance of shared decision-making. This guideline breaks new ground in recommending treatment withdrawal for children with systemic JIA, who may have lower risks of flare than are associated with other forms of JIA, and there is a need for biomarkers that can help distinguish disease that still requires treatment because the risk of relapse remains high upon medication tapering. The low quality of evidence supporting these recommendations underscores the importance of clinical judgment and shared decision-making in everyday care of individuals with JIA.

Results

Patients

Six hundred ninety-five patients were included in this analysis. The median duration in months from diagnosis to study enrolment was 1.6 for the cohort, 0.9 for RF− PA, 2.5 for RF+ PA, 1.8 for oligoarthritis (OA) and 2.9 for patients with systemic-onset JIA (soJIA). Demographic parameters and disease characteristics at study enrolment are summarised in Table 1.

Table 1 
Demographic data of patients at enrolment in ICON

Treatment

Up to enrolment, 95% of all patients with JIA had received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 42% received a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD). Almost 4% were already being treated with a biologic DMARD (bDMARD), whereas 58% were completely DMARD naïve. Half of the patients had received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections and 33% had received systemic glucocorticoids (20% low dose (<0.2 mg/kg body weight/day), 7% high dose (≥0.2 mg/kg body weight/day) and 20% pulse therapy). The median time from symptom onset and from diagnosis to the initiation of a DMARD therapy was 3.9 months (IQR 2–7.7) and 0.3 months (IQR 0.1–1.3), respectively. Patients who had already received a DMARD before enrolment were treated for 1.7 months (median, IQR 0.7–4.2). The medication the patients received during the first year of specialised care is summarised in table 4.

Considering the diagnoses of the patients who required switching, systemic and poliarticular course were the groups with the most frequent b/tsDMARDs changes, in line with other recent study from Turkey and previous registries, like BiKeR, CARRA, or Dutch ABC.

This suggests that achieving remission may be more challenging in systemic and polyarticular JIA, and that children with these disease courses may require additional strategies to improve long-term outcomes. The growing use of switching strategies aligns with the ongoing effort to achieve minimally active or inactive disease, as recommended by T2T guidelines. In patients with JIA, this has been accompanied by an increase in b/tsDMARD use and improved clinical outcomes.

Another important topic to discuss is that due to the high percentage of relapses after clinical remission, it is probably advisable about treatment should be tapered cautiously, using lower doses to maintain clinical remission, including their transition to adulthood period.

Inefficacy was the main reason for switching and was recorded in 62% of all switches. This percentage is somewhat higher than those reported to date in adults.

Systemic JIA was the group with more switches due to inefficacy and it was also the group where the swapping strategy was used over cycling. While several studies on comparative effectiveness between cycling and swapping strategies in rheumatic disease in adulthood, in JIA this data is scarce. A study found that the response to a second biologic was similar between JIA patients who switched to a biologic of the same class and those who switched to a biologic of a different class. The ACR 2019 guideline proposal about treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis for whom an initial TNFi was ineffective recommend switching to a non-TNFi (IL-6 or SI like abatacept). Differentiation of therapeutic approaches according to disease phenotype is in line with ACR recommendations for the treatment of JIA.

### From telemedicine to the ICU-fever and rash in a 9-year-old girl (...) [^4b7bdf9b]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. On arrival to the ED, vital signs were pulse 121 beats per minute, temperature 37. 5°C, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 88/57 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed cracked lips, red ulcers on her hard palate, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and hyperpigmented, blanching macules on her cheeks and arms. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated leukopenia and elevations in ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and alanine aminotransferase.

She had a normal chest radiograph, point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed normal qualitative left ventricular function without evidence of coronary artery dilation, and urinalysis result was positive only for ketones. Dr Marietta De Guzman, Pediatric Rheumatology As a recently identified disease process related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, clinicians have relied on a consensus statement from the American College of Rheumatology for diagnostic guidance and initial management strategy. 1 MIS-C should be suspected in pediatric patients with fever, an epidemiological link to SARS-CoV-2, and inflammation of multiple organ systems, which can be identified on physical examination and laboratory analysis with cardiac biomarkers, liver panel, and acute phase reactants. In her case, persistent fever, rash, oral mucosal inflammation, and gastrointestinal symptoms warranted evaluation for MIS-C.

Although slight elevations in several inflammatory markers were identified, she had negative IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, 2 negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2, and no known contact with a person infected with SARS-CoV-2. The insidious onset of symptoms, persistent negative testing for SARS-CoV-2, and improvement of symptoms with intravenous hydration all would be more consistent with an alternative diagnosis to MIS-C. Her persistently low white blood cell count, predominant lymphocytopenia, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy also raised concerns for lymphoma. She was scheduled for computed tomography of her neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Ultimately, performing an excisional biopsy of a prominent lymph node and examining the histology could help elucidate whether an oncologic, autoimmune, or infectious process was the most likely etiology.

Dr De Guzman The key laboratory findings that suggest an autoimmune condition are the progressive development of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a cold agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The insidious onset of fatigue, fever, oral ulcers, and maculopapular rash in the setting of the aforementioned hematologic laboratory findings fulfill several of the clinical criteria needed for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
4. In addition, her daily fever for nearly one month along with rising AST, ALT, and ferritin was suggestive of an underlying macrophage activation syndrome, a dysregulation in the release of proinflammatory cytokines that can rapidly progress and lead to profound morbidity and mortality. MAS can occur secondary to a variety of rheumatologic conditions, systemic infections, or present spontaneously, and the pathophysiology and clinical features closely resemble those of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Results

Patient characteristics

Out of 545 eligible patients, 330 were treated on conservative strategy, and 135 were treated in early aggressive strategy. Since we only compared early aggressive versus conservative approach, patients with bDMARD only (n=80) were not included in this study. Detailed patient eligibility screening is summarised in figure 2.

Figure 2 
Flow chart of study eligibility screening. JIA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis; pcJIA, polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis; DMARD, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; bDMARD, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; csDMARD, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; cs+bDMARD, combination of conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease\.

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of patients by treatment group. The average time from date of diagnosis to baseline visit were 0.10 year (SD 0.16), similar in both groups (p=0.36). Confounding by indication was clearly evident. Patients on early aggressive treatment had significantly more active disease at baseline (eg, mean±SD of cJADAS 16.08±7.14 vs 12.39±5.91; p<0.0001). The mean and SD of follow-up duration were 0.50±0.06 year and 1.00±0.06 year at 6 and 12 months.

### Advances in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^3ee150a7]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

In 2014, the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) developed standardized consensus-driven treatment plans for treatment of pJIA. The purpose was to develop guidelines to enable observational studies and comparative effectiveness studies and decrease variability of treatment practice. These plans enable physicians to choose the treatment plan they prefer, that may then form part of a standardized database for evaluation. Treatment plans include any JIA that involves more than four joints, and therefore includes ERA, psoriatic JIA, undifferentiated JIA and extended oligoarticular JIA, but specifically exclude systemic JIA. The three regimens include the step-up plan (conventional DMARD followed by biologic after nonresponse), early combination plan (conventional DMARD and biologic at onset) and biologic only plan. There are also recommendations on visit frequency, drug doses and steroid weaning.

These treatment plans differ from the 2011 ACR recommendations, which were developed by a Rand/UCLA appropriateness method, used to assess benefits vs risks of various therapies when definitive evidence does not exist to guide treatment. These are intended more as treatment recommendations, rather than treatment standardizations as in the CARRA initiative. The treatment algorithm is suggested as a recommendation and not a guideline. For JIA that involves more than four joints (which includes ERA without sacroiliitis, psoriatic, RF+ and RF−, extended oligoarticular and undifferentiated JIA), the recommendation is similar to the step-up plan from CARRA above. Notably, these recommendations also include rituximab for pJIA (especially RF+) that is resistant to treatment with TNFα inhibition and abatacept treatment. A large ongoing European collaborative network (SHARE) is being developed to standardize care, and create a basic minimum standard of care across Europe for young people with JIA: the SHARE recommendations have not yet been published.

Systemic JIA without MAS—subsequent therapy after inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids prioritizes biologics over csDMARDs and minimizes long-term glucocorticoids: IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are strongly recommended over a single or combination of csDMARDs for inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids for systemic JIA without MAS, and biologic DMARDs or conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors. There is no preferred agent.

### Successful treatment with tocilizumab every 4 weeks of a low disease activity group who achieve a drug-free remission in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^9518c007]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

For the lower disease activity group, or mild SoJIA, TCZ infused every 4 weeks may well be sufficient. These patients will be also treated with the conventional protocol such as the low-dose corticosteroid management, or they might have been a patient with a monocyclic SoJIA course type.

One weakness of our study is that identification of the low disease activity SoJIA group is problematic as patients often receive concomitant anti-rheumatic treatment, such as CS, MTX, and CsA, before entering into the tocilizumab treatment. Whether the lower disease activity group really exists, or their disease activity was lowered by the previous treatment,or both, is hard to distinguish and may influence our judgment on the efficacy of tocilizumab in each patient. Yet in our trial there were impressive differences that support the reality of a lower disease activity group. In the patient group with low disease activity who were treated every 4 weeks, we could decrease CS more frequently and faster, had less frequency of relapses, had better response rates, more quickly achieved a status of inactive disease and TCZ-free remission. We believe that these treatment responses and outcomes support the likelihood of a low disease activity group in our SoJIA patients at our center.

The elongation of intervals between infusions without failure of efficacy has a lot of benefits. We have to be aware of the cost-benefit ratio. Also, less frequent infusions improves the patient’s and family’s quality of life with less frequent outpatient infusions or hospital infusions.

There are other limitations of our study. It is a non-blinded retrospective cohort study with all the limitations of such a study. In any single center’s experience with TCZ, there is a problem with a smaller sample size which may bias our results. The observation period after the TCZ infusions is also relatively short. These criteria are useful for our patients and it remains to be seen if it proves useful in larger series of patients and at other centers.

### Disease activity at two consecutive registry visits and subsequent medication escalation for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the CARRA registry [^37f26c9d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) often requires disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to control disease activity and improve inflammatory symptoms like pain and swelling. While there are consensus-based guidelines for initiating medications, the most effective strategies to escalate care over-time remain unclear. Many patients will switch biologic DMARDs or use alternative dosing regimens over the course of their disease, but the optimal timing and disease activity thresholds for change is unknown or controversial.

Recent research recommends a treat to target (T2T) strategy in JIA; a strategy that includes setting a treatment goal based on shared decision making with parents and patients, measuring disease activity at regular intervals, and making treatment changes to achieve and maintain that goal. For most patients the treatment goal should be inactive disease, or at least low disease activity (LDA). This determination should be based on measurement of disease activity using a validated composite instrument performed and documented on a regular basis. Despite these recommendations, the measurement tool and medications are not specified as these can vary between the categories of JIA (systemic JIA, oligoarticular JIA, polyarticular JIA, enthesitis related arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis) and treatment needs for extra-articular manifestations (e.g. uveitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease). These T2T recommendations for JIA were based on extrapolated studies of adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had better clinical outcomes with T2T compared to usual care and the current recommendations for treating RA. There have been few studies of outcomes for patients with JIA following a T2T approach and parents of children with JIA and providers recognize the importance of incorporating patient goals in treatment decision making. However, it is unknown if current real-world treatment patterns for JIA patients reflect T2T practice, i.e. routine implementation of structured treatment protocols by escalating medications according to measured disease activity.

Using the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry, a North American multicenter registry including patients with JIA, we examined the association between clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (cJADAS) thresholds and associated medication changes. Because JIA is a chronic disease where one time point may not fully represent the course of the disease, we aimed to examine medication escalation by patterns of disease activity at two sequential registry visits. Since prior analysis of the CARRA Registry suggested that fewer than half of the participants had cJADAS ≤ 1 at the 12-month visit, we hypothesized that persistent moderate or high disease activity would lead to DMARD escalation in fewer than half of patients.

### Advances in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^d38d94df]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in the management strategies of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and identify unanswered questions and avenues for further research.

Recent Findings

There is evidence for an early, aggressive, treat-to-target approach for polyarticular JIA. Clinical disease activity criteria have been recently defined and validated, including criteria for inactive disease and the juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS). There is a need for evidence-based, defined disease targets and biomarkers for prediction of response, including targets for remission induction, and guidelines on drug withdrawal. Recent treatment consensus plans and guidelines are discussed and compared, including the 2015 NHS England clinical policy statement, the 2014 Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) treatment plans and the 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. Evidence for new agents such as tocilizumab, rituximab, golimumab, ustekinumab, certolizumab and tofacitinib is promising: the recent clinical trials are summarized here. Stratification of individual patient treatment remains a goal, and predictive biomarkers have been shown to predict success in the withdrawal of methotrexate therapy.

Summary

There are promising advances in the treatment approaches, disease activity criteria, clinical guidelines, pharmaceutical choices and individually stratified therapy choices for polyarticular JIA.

### Childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance consensus treatment plans for new-onset polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^4df08416]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

There is no standardized approach to the initial treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) among pediatric rheumatologists. Understanding the comparative effectiveness of the diverse therapeutic options available will result in better health outcomes for polyarticular JIA. The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) developed consensus treatment plans (CTPs) for use in clinical practice to facilitate such studies.

Methods

A case-based survey was administered to CARRA members to identify the common treatment approaches for new-onset polyarticular JIA. Two face-to-face consensus conferences employed modified nominal group technique to identify treatment strategies, operational case definition, end points, and data elements to be collected. A core workgroup reviewed the relevant literature, refined plans, and developed medication dosing and monitoring recommendations.

Results

The initial case-based survey identified significant variability among treatment approaches for new-onset polyarticular JIA. We developed 3 CTPs based on treatment strategies for the first 12 months of therapy, as well as case definitions and clinical and laboratory monitoring schedules. The CTPs include a step-up plan (nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD] followed by a biologic DMARD), an early combination plan (nonbiologic and biologic DMARD combined within a month of treatment initiation), and a biologic only plan. This approach was approved by 96% of the CARRA JIA Research Committee members attending the 2013 CARRA face-to-face meeting.

Conclusion

Three standardized CTPs were developed for new-onset polyarticular JIA. Coupled with data collection at defined intervals, use of these CTPs will enable the study of their comparative effectiveness in an observational setting to optimize initial management of polyarticular JIA.

### Pilot study comparing the childhood arthritis&rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis consensus treatment plans [^5a131662]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Follow-up visits occurred at intervals defined by the CTPs and consistent with routine care: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months after baseline. Unscheduled visits were conducted if there was a change in CTP medication. Clinical and laboratory data, determined previously by consensus-based process and also consistent with routine care, were collected at these time points through the CARRA Registry as outlined in the CTPs. The CTPs recommended that if patients worsened or failed to improve sufficiently as determined by the physician’s assessment of disease activity, GC could be added or increased, or the treatment (CTP) changed. Suggested GC tapering schedules corresponding to very rapid, rapid, moderate, and slow tapering schedules were provided to be used by the treating physician but were not compulsory. By 3 months after CTP initiation, if the child was still receiving ≥50% of the starting dose of GC, it was recommended that the treatment (CTP) should be changed anticipating a better outcome. The treating physicians were asked why a particular initial CTP was chosen, and to provide the reason if the treating CTP was changed. Serious adverse events, including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and side effects of medications, were collected.

Outcomes included the primary endpoint of the study: clinical inactive disease (CID) off glucocorticoids at 9 months. CID was defined using the ACR provisional criteria for defining clinical inactive disease which specifies all the following: no active arthritis, a physician’s global assessment of disease activity score of 0, ESR and/or CRP in the normal range, no features of systemic JIA (fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy), no uveitis and duration of morning stiffness for <15 min. All inactive disease criteria were available for all children who had a documented 9 month visit. For the primary endpoint analysis, all patients were included even if lost to follow-up. The GC and methotrexate CTP-initiated patients were combined as the non-biologic CTP group, while the IL1i and IL6i CTP initiated patients were combined as the biologic CTP group. Secondarily, all 4 CTPs were analyzed separately assessing achievement of the primary endpoint, as well as the ability to lower GC doses.

### Economic evaluation of infliximab, synthetic triple therapy and methotrexate in the treatment of newly diagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^9221676a]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune rheumatoid condition starting in childhood, with incidence of 7–23/100,000. In 40–60% of the patients, the disease continues into adulthood, possibly causing significant functional impairment and economic burden. The current recommended initial therapy for patients with polyarticular JIA is methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy. Biologics are used as second-line therapy.

For the time being, biologic therapies are much more expensive than conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), although biosimilars have reduced the costs of therapy in some countries. In JIA, medication costs became more than 3-fold when DMARDs were switched to etanercept. In adult rheumatoid arthritis, costs of biologics were 2–3-fold compared with DMARDs, but the estimated addition of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) was minimal.

The original study (ACUTE-JIA) focused on early aggressive therapy in patients with new-onset polyarticular JIA, who were biologic and DMARD naïve. Due to availability of biologics at onset of the study, we chose infliximab, which is widely used off-label in care of JIA. Direct comparisons between different anti-TNF products are missing. However, their efficacy and safety profiles have indirectly shown similarities, and thus we find infliximab treatment representative for anti-TNFs as a group. The results of ACUTE-JIA demonstrated superior efficacy of biologic over conventional therapy. Moreover, combination of three DMARDs was more effective than DMARD monotherapy. In polyarticular JIA, biologics in combination with DMARDs have also shown good efficacy and safety profile.

In children, only few direct cost-effectiveness comparisons of different therapies of JIA exist. To our knowledge, reports on costs of biosimilar therapies in JIA have not been published to date. In this study, we used the data collected in the ACUTE-JIA study to assess short-term costs and cost-effectiveness of infliximab plus methotrexate compared with triple or monotherapy of DMARDs in an early aggressive treat-to-target approach.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a review for the pediatrician (...) [^a67018cb]. publications.aap.org (2006). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood. It also is one of the more common chronic diseases of childhood, occurring as frequently as juvenile diabetes mellitus, four times more frequently than cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, and 10 times more frequently than acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hemophilia, or muscular dystrophy. JIA is a new classification of juvenile arthritis developed by the International League Against Rheumatism that is used worldwide; it is replacing the previous American classification of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The cause of JIA is unknown, but substantial evidence suggests that the pathogenesis is autoimmune. The diagnosis of JIA is one of exclusion and is made by using a combination of historical, clinical, and laboratory data. The disease course is highly variable, and in the past, JIA had been viewed as a more benign illness than is recognized currently. Recent data reveal that.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: therapeutic approaches for non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis [^264d74d3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop treatment recommendations for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis.

Methods

The Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions were developed and refined by members of the guideline development teams. A systematic review was conducted to compile evidence for the benefits and harms associated with treatments for these conditions. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was conducted among the Voting Panel to generate the final recommendations and grade their strength. A Parent and Patient Panel used a similar consensus approach to provide patient/caregiver preferences for key questions.

Results

Thirty-nine recommendations were developed (8 strong and 31 conditional). The quality of supporting evidence was very low or low for 90% of the recommendations. Recommendations are provided for the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and intraarticular and oral glucocorticoids. Recommendations for the use of physical and occupational therapy are also provided. Specific recommendations for polyarthritis address general medication use, initial and subsequent treatment, and adjunctive therapies. Good disease control, with therapeutic escalation to achieve low disease activity, was recommended. The sacroiliitis and enthesitis recommendations primarily address initial therapy and adjunctive therapies.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians, caregivers, and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians, caregivers, and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

### Childhood arthritis (...) [^1ae6313a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Childhood arthritis can cause pain, stiffness, joint or body swelling, and life-long damage to joints.
- Symptoms may go away or continue into adulthood.
- While there is no cure for childhood arthritis, there are ways to manage and treat it. Overview Arthritis that develops in children is called childhood arthritis. A Childhood arthritis begins when the immune system becomes overactive, leading to joint and body swelling. Childhood arthritis can cause pain, loss of motion, and permanent damage in the joints.
- This can make it hard for a child to walk, play, or dress themselves.
- It can also result in disability. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of childhood arthritis may be different for every child. They can include:
- Joint pain.
- Swelling.
- Fever.
- Stiffness.
- Rash.
- Feeling tired.
- Loss of appetite. There may be times when symptoms get worse, known as "flares.

" There may also be times when symptoms get better, known as "remission. ". Who gets childhood arthritis Any child can develop arthritis. But arthritis is more common in children who:
- Have anxiety or depression.
- Have a heart condition.
- Have overweight.
- Are not physically active.
- Live with people who smoke. Diagnosis Symptoms of childhood arthritis might seem like other illnesses and injuries. A pediatric rheumatologist, who specializes in childhood arthritis, can help figure out the right diagnosis. These doctors can diagnose childhood arthritis by doing:
- A physical exam.
- X-rays.
- Lab tests.
- A review of health history. Management To help manage arthritis, doctors may prescribe medicine and advise children to be physically active. This may include exercises like those recommended by the Arthritis Foundation:
- Water exercises.
- Swimming.
- Bicycling.
- Tai chi.

Doctors can work with children and their parents or caregivers to develop a treatment plan. Transitioning patients to adult care Some children's arthritis improves as they age. Others may continue to have symptoms into adulthood. Moving from child to adult care can be hard for those with arthritis. It can also be hard for their parents, caregivers, and health care providers. The Arthritis Foundation has transition resources on how to:
- Make appointments.
- Understand health insurance.
- Adjust to working or education beyond high school.
- The most common form of childhood arthritis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

It includes seven types: oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis–rheumatoid factor negative, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis–rheumatoid factor positive, enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Other forms of childhood arthritis include fibromyalgia, myosis, lupus, scleroderma, and vasculitis.

Conclusions

It is strongly encouraging that the majority of patients with new onset sJIA had excellent outcomes, with less GC usage than was necessary prior to the availability of biologics. The availability of biologics effective for treating sJIA has undoubtedly changed outcomes for the vast majority of patients with this disease. We look forward to following the outcomes of these patients in the longer term, since all FROST patients are enrolled in the CARRA Registry, enabling follow up for at least 10 years.
