## Question

Lactulose syrup for age 8 month ￼

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosing, safety, monitoring, and alternatives for lactulose syrup in an 8-month-old infant with functional constipation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the infant's age and whether the constipation is likely functional versus organic. Then, I should verify the most current guideline-preferred therapy and where lactulose fits if that first-line option is unavailable. Next, I will extract the FDA-labeled pediatric dosing for lactulose and translate it into a practical, weight-based regimen with titration targets. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring, including electrolyte and hydration risks. Finally, I will outline administration tips, duration of therapy, and what to do if lactulose is not tolerated or ineffective, anchoring each step to guidelines and labeling.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely diagnosis. At 8 months, most constipation is functional, but I should screen for red flags such as delayed meconium, failure to thrive, vomiting, bloody stools, or neurologic concerns that would prompt evaluation for Hirschsprung disease, hypothyroidism, or other organic causes before empiric laxative therapy, per pediatric constipation algorithms and evaluation guidance [^1123rukK] [^113TeMhJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about lactulose as first-line. I need to check the current pediatric guidelines. ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN recommend polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes as first-line maintenance therapy for childhood constipation, with a starting dose of about 0.4 g/kg/day and dose adjustments to achieve 2–3 soft stools daily; lactulose is considered an alternative if PEG is not available or not tolerated, which means lactulose is acceptable but not preferred in this age group [^112BVfM8] [^1153QbBH] [^1155BmY1].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA-labeled pediatric dosing for lactulose because that will anchor the practical regimen. Multiple FDA labels consistently state that for infants the recommended initial daily oral dose is 2.5 to 10 mL of standard 10 g/15 mL lactulose solution, given in divided doses, with the goal of 2–3 soft stools per day and dose reduction if diarrhea occurs [^112gQPMD] [^112FcBxJ] [^112Fvxzw].

> I should double-check formulation details to ensure accurate dosing. Standard lactulose syrup is 10 g per 15 mL, so 2.5 mL equals about 1.67 g and 10 mL equals about 6.67 g of lactulose per day. This helps when thinking about milliliter-based titration in small infants and aligns with the labeled concentration and dosing language [^112Fvxzw] [^111rNQLW].

> Let me think about a practical starting regimen for an 8-month-old. A reasonable starting point is 2.5 mL twice daily, totaling 5 mL/day, with titration every few days based on stool consistency and frequency toward 2–3 soft stools daily. If constipation persists, increase to 5 mL twice daily (total 10 mL/day), and if diarrhea occurs, reduce the dose or hold and reassess, which mirrors the labeled infant range and titration principle [^112gQPMD] [^112Fvxzw].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are addressed. Lactulose contains galactose and lactose, so it is contraindicated in patients who require a low-galactose diet and should be used with caution in diabetes. Common adverse effects include flatulence, cramping, and dose-dependent diarrhea, and excessive diarrhea can lead to dehydration, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia, so caregivers should monitor for these and adjust the dose promptly if loose stools occur [^1153QbBH] [^112HRkbt] [^1134NbfM] [^112AkXwb].

> But wait, what if the infant is on other medications that could blunt lactulose's effect or interact. Nonabsorbable antacids may inhibit the colonic acidification that lactulose produces, and oral antibiotics like neomycin could theoretically reduce bacterial metabolism of lactulose; if such agents are necessary, I should monitor stool response more closely and consider alternative strategies if efficacy wanes [^111TX8ve] [^116yYJSn].

> Next, I should review administration and palatability. Lactulose syrup can be mixed with water, milk, breast milk, formula, or small amounts of juice to improve acceptance. Using an oral syringe or dosing spoon improves accuracy, and caregivers should be instructed to measure carefully and avoid household teaspoons for dosing precision [^1173yY8f] [^111rNQLW].

> I will now examine duration and follow-up. Maintenance therapy should continue until the child has been having regular, soft stools without straining or withholding for at least 1 month, and many experts continue for 2–3 months before gradual weaning. During toilet training, it is prudent to maintain therapy until training is established to reduce relapse risk, with reassessment of adherence and stool diaries guiding adjustments [^112BVfM8] [^117V8iu6].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if lactulose is ineffective or poorly tolerated. If there is inadequate response after appropriate dose titration, switching to PEG is reasonable given its superior efficacy and tolerability in pediatric trials; if there is fecal impaction, address disimpaction first with PEG 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days or rectal therapy if PEG is unavailable, before resuming maintenance therapy [^117AuUvh] [^1155BmY1] [^114sqNDv].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For an 8-month-old with functional constipation, start lactulose at 2.5 mL twice daily and titrate within the 2.5–10 mL/day infant range to achieve 2–3 soft stools daily, monitor for gas, cramping, and diarrhea with dose adjustments, avoid use in galactose-restricted diets, and prefer PEG if available or if lactulose is not effective or tolerated, documenting response with a stool diary and reassessing for red flags if symptoms persist [^112gQPMD] [^112BVfM8] [^117V8iu6].

---

Lactulose syrup is appropriate for an 8-month-old with constipation when PEG is unavailable, with a **starting dose of 2.5–5 mL/day** [^112gQPMD] divided once or twice daily, titrated to 2–3 soft stools/day. It is generally safe and well tolerated, but monitor for diarrhea, gas, and cramping [^1134NbfM]; reduce dose if diarrhea occurs [^112Fvxzw]. PEG is preferred first-line [^112BVfM8] due to better efficacy and fewer side effects [^117AuUvh]; use lactulose only if PEG is not available or tolerated [^114E4xjY].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Initial dose**: 2.5–5 mL/day (about 0.17–0.33 g/kg/day) [^notfound] in 1–2 divided doses.
- **Titration**: Adjust to achieve 2–3 soft stools/day; reduce dose if diarrhea occurs [^112Fvxzw].
- **Duration**: Continue maintenance therapy for at least 2 months [^112BVfM8], tapering only after 1 month of symptom resolution.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common side effects**: Gas, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea [^1134NbfM] are common but usually mild and transient [^111rNQLW].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare; excessive dosing can cause diarrhea with dehydration, hypokalemia, or hypernatremia [^1134NbfM] [^114PYmDt].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for diarrhea or dehydration; adjust dose as needed [^116yYJSn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

PEG is **first-line** [^112BVfM8] for pediatric constipation because of superior efficacy and tolerability [^117AuUvh]; lactulose is an **alternative** [^114E4xjY] when PEG is unavailable or not tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other osmotic laxatives

| **Attribute** | **Lactulose** | **Peg** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Moderate | Higher [^117AuUvh] |
| Tolerability | More gas/bloating [^115GugkU] | Better tolerated [^117AuUvh] |
| Palatability | Sweet syrup | Tasteless powder |
| First-line status | Alternative [^114E4xjY] | Preferred [^112BVfM8] |

---

## Practical considerations for caregivers

- **Administration**: Give with water, milk, or juice to improve acceptance [^1173yY8f].
- **Storage**: Store at room temperature; do not freeze.
- **Adherence**: Use a diary to track stools and symptoms for dose titration [^1123rukK].

---

Lactulose syrup is a **reasonable alternative** for an 8-month-old with constipation when PEG is unavailable, starting at 2.5–5 mL/day and titrating to effect; monitor for GI effects and adjust as needed [^116NRRqj] [^112Fvxzw].

### Partly fermented infant formulae with specific oligosaccharides support adequate infant growth and are well-tolerated [^116YCbHr]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Trial Design

The present study was a prospective, double-blind, controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter controlled equivalence trial. Infants, whose parents intended to feed their infants formula, were assigned to 1 of the 4 groups, using a computerized random-number generator with sex and study site strata. Formulae were coded by the sponsor and both the investigators and the infant's parents were blinded to the formula. Baseline measurements were taken at enrolment and parents received the assigned infant formula with written preparation instructions, were advised to feed infants ad libitum, and were provided with recommendations for product intake volumes depending on the infant's weight.

During the intervention period infants were to be fed ad libitum exclusively with their allocated formula starting on the day of enrolment (0–28 days of age) until 17 weeks of age. The study consisted of a baseline visit and 4 subsequent hospital visits at 4, 8, 13, and 17 weeks of postnatal age. In addition, a follow-up phone call was performed 2 weeks after the last study visit. Parents were provided with diaries to record formula intake, GI symptoms, crying, sleeping, and stool characteristics every day during the week before the study visits. At each visit, investigators took anthropometric measures, reviewed compliance (based on evaluation of diaries), provided study product, and assessed the occurrence and outcome of (serious) AEs and use of concomitant medication and nutritional supplements by open questioning and/or diagnosis.

Furthermore, fecal samples were collected by the parents either during or shortly after the baseline visit, and just before the final visit at their infant's age of 17 weeks for analysis of the fecal physiological parameters and microbiological composition.

### Acceptability of different oral formulations in infants and preschool children [^113XCZnx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

This study is the first randomised cross-over trial investigating the child and parent acceptability of and preference among four oral placebo formulations in infants and preschool children. It is also the first study investigating the child acceptability of oral placebo formulations in a domiciliary rather than inpatient setting, with a double rather than single administration of each formulation, a 4 mm, rather than a 2 or 3 mm tablet, and with two different measuring instruments for child acceptability.

In this study, an indication was found that the mean VAS acceptability score of the tablet was higher than that of the syrup, and that the parents preferred the tablet over the syrup. However, when parents were asked to report the child's preference, no significant difference was found between the syrup and the tablet. Results such as ours provide an argument for the fact that child and parent acceptability and preferences are different outcomes providing complementary information on the suitability of a formulation. Preferably, these outcomes are investigated in the same study.

This study has some limitations. First, the administrations were not supervised by the research team as this would bias normal family routines. Consequently, the evaluation of the child acceptability and preference relied on parental reports. This self-reporting methodology was not validated prior to the start of the study. Therefore, recruiters focused heavily on adequate verbal instructions to the method of administration and reporting.

Second, child acceptability may be influenced by taste aspects. The powder and tablet were manufactured from the same blend, so their taste was identical. However, the taste of the suspension and syrup differed due to the intrinsic nature of these dosage forms. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that any differences in the acceptability and preference among the liquid formulations were also related to taste.

Third, the recruitment was tailored to healthy domiciliary children between 1 and 4 years of age and parent with mastery of the Dutch language. Hence, the applicability of our findings to children outside this population, for example, children who are feeling ill, who are otherwise fractious or who are from a foreign ethnicity is left for future research. In view of the findings of the teams of Ansah, Bagenda, and Spomer, it is anticipated that our study's findings will equally hold for older children.

### Lactulose solution, usp… [^111rNQLW]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Since lactulose solution contains galactose and lactose it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician. Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose for more than six months should have serum electrolytes measured periodically. In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 3 or 6 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lactulose solution is administered to a nursing woman. Precise frequency data are not available. Initial dosing may produce flatulence and intestinal cramps, which are usually transient. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement. Note: Some patients have found that lactulose solution may be more acceptable when mixed with fruit juice, water or milk.

Lactulose Solution, USP 10 g/15 mL is available as follows: 8 fl oz bottle 16 fl oz bottle 32 fl oz bottle.

### (lactulose solution, USP 10 g / 15 mL) [^112Fvxzw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral Adult: The usual adult, oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily. Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of lactulose for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose. Pediatric: Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2. 5 to 10 mL in divided doses. For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued.

Rectal When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used. Three hundred mL of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If the enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately. The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication. Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients.

Lactulose, given orally in the recommended doses, should be started before Lactulose by enema is stopped entirely. In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition. Lactulose Solution USP, 10 g/15 mL, is a natural colored and an unflavored solution supplied in one pint bottles.

### The effects of lactulose supplementation to enteral feedings in premature infants: a pilot study [^114oWGuQ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety and prebiotic effects of lactulose in preterm infants.

Study Design

This was a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-center study in 23- to 34-weeks premature infants. The study group received 1% lactulose, and control infants received 1% dextrose in all feeds (human milk or formula).

Results

Twenty-eight infants participated (15 lactulose, 13 placebo). Small doses of lactulose appeared to be safe and did not cause diarrhea. Premature infants on lactulose had more Lactobacilli-positive stool cultures that appeared earlier with larger number of colonies. The lactulose group tended to have less intolerance to enteral feedings, to reach full oral feeds earlier, and to be discharged home earlier. They also tended to have fewer episodes of late-onset sepsis, lower Bell stage necrotizing enterocolitis, and their nutritional laboratory indices were better, especially calcium and total protein.

Conclusions

This pilot study supports the safety of supplementing preterm infants' feeds with low doses of lactulose. It also demonstrated trends that may suggest positive prebiotic effects.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oral

Adult

The usual adult oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 mL, containing 20 g to 30 g of Generlac Solution) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.

Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of Generlac Solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal-systemic encephalopathy. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose of Generlac Solution may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose. Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later.

Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of Generlac Solution for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^1126KB2K]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

The final studywas a multicentre open label parallel group study carried out in seven hospitals in China, comparing PEG 4000 with lactulose in 216 children. Participants were aged 8–18 years (mean 11.2 years) and had a minimum 3-month history of constipation, with a baseline Bristol Stool Form Scale of less than 3.

Patients were randomised to receive PEG or lactulose at a fixed dose of 20 g (PEG) or 10 g (lactulose) daily for 2 weeks. Doses could be reduced according to clinical response, if required. The randomisation method is not known and treatment was not blinded. Outcomes assessed included stool frequency, stool consistency and complete constipation remission rate.

All the participants completed the 14-day trial. Intention to treat analysis showed an increase in median weekly stool frequency in both groups. In PEG-treated patients the median increased from 2/week at baseline to 7/week; in lactulose-treated patients the median increased from 2/week at baseline to 6/week. The between-treatments difference was statistically significant. PEG was also significantly better in terms of the proportions with complete resolution of constipation (72% vs 41%, p < 0.05), mean Bristol Stool Form Scale (4.26 vs 3.63, p < 0.05) and resolution of abdominal pain (75% vs 57%, p < 0.05).

Brief summary of comparisons versus other laxatives (one study)

One studyhas compared PEG 3550 with milk of magnesia in a randomised open label parallel group study of 79 children aged 4–16 years that lasted 12 months. There was no significant difference between groups in either mean number of bowel movements or episodes of faecal incontinence over the course of the study. However, more children refused treatment with milk of magnesia than with PEG (35% vs 5%, p < 0.001).

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^113RteJT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

The third studywas a multicentre double-blind parallel group study carried out in three hospitals, comparing PEG 3350 (without electrolytes) with lactulose in 100 children. Participants were aged 6 months to 15 years and had to have experienced two or more of the following for the preceding 3 months: < 3 bowel movements/week, > 1 faecal incontinence/week, large amount of stool every 7–30 days, palpable abdominal/rectal mass.

Patients were randomised to receive PEG or lactulose at a starting dose of 2.95 g or 6 g, respectively, for those aged under 6 years of age and 5.9 g or 12 g for those aged over 6 years of age. The randomisation method was not described. Medications were dispensed as dry powder in identical unlabelled sachets with investigators and patients blinded to assignation. Doses were titrated according to response, with the option to add in bisacodyl if required. The primary outcomes were stool frequency, faecal incontinence and overall treatment success at 8 weeks.

Ninety one of the original 100 participants completed the trial. Two patients in each group were lost to follow-up. One patient withdrew from the PEG group due to dislike of the taste. Two patients were withdrawn from the lactulose group as they were found to be Helicobacter positive. The reason for withdrawal for one patient in each group was not stated. At 8 weeks the mean dose of PEG was 5.4 g/day and lactulose 13.9 g/day. Bisacodyl was used by nine patients in the PEG group and 10 in the lactulose group. Per protocol analysis showed a mean weekly stool frequency at 8 weeks in the PEG and lactulose groups, respectively, of 7.12 and 6.43 (p = NS). In both groups there was significant improvement versus baseline. There was also no significant difference in the frequency of faecal incontinence. However, the rate of overall treatment success (stool ⩾3/week+incontinence < 1/fortnight) was significantly better in PEG treated patients than in those on lactulose (56% vs 29%, p = 0.02).

### Infant nutritional status, feeding practices, enteropathogen exposure, socioeconomic status, and illness are associated with gut barrier function as assessed by the lactulose mannitol test in the MAL-ED birth cohort [^113QBceZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As previously described, the MAL-ED study is a prospective longitudinal birth cohort study conducted at eight sites: Dhaka, Bangladesh (BGD); Vellore, India (INV); Bhaktapur, Nepal (NEB); Naushero Feroze, Pakistan (PKN); Fortaleza, Brazil (BRF); Loreto, Peru (PEL); Venda, South Africa (SAV); and Haydom, Tanzania (TZH). Each site aimed to follow 200 newborns through the first 24 months of life. Overall 2,145 newborns were enrolled with the following inclusion criteria: < 17 days old, singleton, birth weight > 1,500 g, no serious illness, mother ≥ 16 years old, and plans to stay in the community at least 6 months. Written consent was obtained at enrollment and study procedures received ethical approval at each site and at collaborating institutions. Study participants were enrolled on a rolling basis over a 2.25-year period starting in October 2009.

Enrollment questionnaires captured sociodemographic, maternal, and household characteristics. Infants were weighed and measured using standardized procedures at enrollment and every month thereafter. Caregivers were queried biweekly regarding morbidity and feeding patterns. Non-diarrheal stools were collected monthly and analyzed for a panel of bacterial, viral, and parasitic enteropathogens; diarrheal stools were similarly evaluated. At 6-month intervals, information on water, sanitation conditions in the household, family income, and assets was obtained.

At 3, 6, 9, and 15 months, children were administered the LM test using a standardized protocol previously described. In brief, an LM solution (250 mg/mL lactulose and 50 mg/mL mannitol, 1,002 mOsm/L) was administered at 2 mL/kg of child weight up to a maximum of 20 mL. Just as is the case for oral medication, such as vitamins or probiotics for colic, this is not considered a breach in exclusive breastfeeding practice by health professionals. Children were fasted for 2 hours prior to and 30 minutes following solution administration, except breast milk, which was permitted ad libitum. The child's urine was collected continuously for 5 hours after sugar solution administration and the total urine volume was recorded.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^115ynb5t]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — ammonia levels and encephalopathy risk note clinically important thresholds and cautions: Ammonia levels of > 100 µmol/L on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade HE, and a level of > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; medical therapy targeting ammonia reduction is often prescribed; lactulose may be favored over rifaximin given its mechanism of action and shorter time to clinical effect, however no definitive data suggests that either impact clinical outcomes; mechanisms driving HE extend beyond ammonia so reliance upon a singular ammonia value to determine the presence of HE should be avoided, with its measurement supporting the clinical assessment at the bedside.

This phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted in outpatients consulting in two general hospitals in Thailand (Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok and Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital, Nakhon Ratchasima) from 2004 to 2008. The study was registered in the Clinical Trials database of the US National Institute of Health under the study identifier NCT00255372.

Each patient underwent four study visits. At the screening visit (Visit 1; Week -2), inclusion criteria were verified and demographic and clinical information was documented. The patient's family was provided with dietary advice to restore normal bowel movements and with a diary in which stool output was to be recorded. At the inclusion visit (Visit 2; Week 0), if constipation had not resolved through dietary modification, eligibility criteria were verified and the patient was randomised to one of the two treatment groups. A new stool diary was provided. The patients attended two follow-up visits (Visits 3 and 4; Weeks 2 and 4) to document efficacy and safety of treatment.

Patients

The study included young children aged between 12 to 36 months with a diagnosis of chronic functional constipation based on a modification of the Rome II criteria for infants and preschool children. This was defined as EITHER a stool frequency of ≤ 2 per week persisting for at least three months OR the presence of pebble-like, hard stools, painful defecation or faecal incontinence for at least three months. Faecal incontinence was defined operationally as soiling of underclothes in children who had already acquired toilet skills.

All patients were followed for two weeks (between Visits 1 and 2) following provision of dietary advice, and only those children whose symptoms failed to improve during this period were eligible. Children whose parents failed to provide written informed consent were not eligible. Exclusion criteria included the presence of organic bowel disease, suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, a history of GI surgery, any other condition or baseline finding that might, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the implementation or interpretation of the study, and a history of hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or related drugs.

In order to evaluate possible inclusion bias, each investigator documented in a screening log all patients who were considered eligible for the study but who were not in fact enrolled. For each patient, the primary reason for exclusion was recorded. Patients could be withdrawn from the study if their parents requested discontinuation of treatment because of lack of efficacy.

### PEG 3350 (transipeg) versus lactulose in the treatment of childhood functional constipation: a double blind, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial [^1136KzSZ]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) has been suggested as a good alternative laxative to lactulose as a treatment option in paediatric constipation. However, no large randomised controlled trials exist evaluating the efficacy of either laxative.

Aims

To compare PEG 3350 (Transipeg: polyethylene glycol with electrolytes) with lactulose in paediatric constipation and evaluate clinical efficacy/side effects.

Patients

One hundred patients (aged 6 months-15 years) with paediatric constipation were included in an eight week double blinded, randomised, controlled trial.

Methods

After faecal disimpaction, patients < 6 years of age received PEG 3350 (2.95 g/sachet) or lactulose (6 g/sachet) while children ≥ 6 years started with 2 sachets/day. Primary outcome measures were: defecation and encopresis frequency/week and successful treatment after eight weeks. Success was defined as a defecation frequency ≥ 3/week and encopresis ≤ 1 every two weeks. Secondary outcome measures were side effects after eight weeks of treatment.

Results

A total of 91 patients (49 male) completed the study. A significant increase in defecation frequency (PEG 3350: 3 pre v 7 post treatment/week; lactulose: 3 pre v 6 post/week) and a significant decrease in encopresis frequency (PEG 3350: 10 pre v 3 post/week; lactulose: 8 pre v 3 post/week) was found in both groups (NS). However, success was significantly higher in the PEG group (56%) compared with the lactulose group (29%). PEG 3350 patients reported less abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation than children using lactulose. However, bad taste was reported significantly more often in the PEG group.

Conclusions

PEG 3350 (0.26 (0.11) g/kg), compared with lactulose (0.66 (0.32) g/kg), provided a higher success rate with fewer side effects. PEG 3350 should be the laxative of first choice in childhood constipation.

### Knowledge and practice of pediatricians regarding childhood constipation in the arab world: results from a multicenter survey [^1163CvRw]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current study, we observed several discrepancies between PCPs (pediatricians and nonpediatricians) regarding the definition and diagnosis of childhood constipation, as shown in Table 2.

Despite increased awareness and application of the Rome IV criteria among PCPs, there are no obvious reasons why PSu differs from FPs/GPs regarding the definition of childhood constipation. However, medical education and adequate disclosure of constipation guidelines are necessary for PCPs.

Given the scarcity of published randomized controlled studies, the management of childhood constipation is primarily based on the physicians' expertise rather than the published literature. However, the NASPGHAN Constipation Guideline Committee stated that fecal disimpaction is advised before maintenance therapy with oral laxatives with/without rectal laxatives. Rectal enemas or transient high-dose oral PEG for three days are two pharmacological treatments for fecal disimpaction. High-dose PEG is associated with a greater incidence of fecal incontinence throughout management when compared to enemas; nonetheless, PEG is suggested as the primary choice for disimpaction since it may be delivered orally and is less invasive. Surprisingly, we reported in our study that half of the PCPs (50.3%) prescribed a special milk formula (high-magnesium formula) for the treatment of fecal disimpaction. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended against the use of dietary interventions alone as first-line management for constipation and recommended the use of PEG-based solutions or lactulose with an escalating dose regimen. Magnesium is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of functional constipation that can promote balanced water reabsorption from the large intestine mucosa, retaining the appropriate water amount so that stools have a softer consistency without being loose. Xinias et al. evaluated the efficacy of a synbiotic formula with high magnesium content for maintenance treatment of functional constipation. This formula significantly improved functional constipation, resulting in a better quality of life for the parents and infants. In our study, most PCPs prescribed this formula for disimpaction and maintenance treatment of constipation despite pediatricians reporting using rectal disimpaction (glycerin suppository, fleet enemas, and PEG) significantly more often than nonpediatricians.

†Control vs. LF-0.6 significantly different (P < 0.05)

‡Control vs. LF-1.0 significantly different (P < 0.05)

In the overall study population (all participants up to 365 days of age) no statistically significant group differences were detected for study formula discontinuation either related to study formula (Control: 18, 12%; LF-0.6: 20, 12%; LF-1.0: 17, 11%) or not related to study formula (Control: 50, 32%; LF-0.6: 42, 26%; LF-1.0: 49, 31%). Of the 55 participants with formula-related discontinuation, formula intolerance as determined by the study investigator was the most common reason (Control: 13; LF-0.6: 14; LF-1.0: 15) with fussiness (Control: 5; LF-0.6: 8; LF-1.0: 10) and gas (Control: 6; LF-0.6: 3; LF-1.0: 6) as the most common symptoms. Parental decision was the most common reason for discontinuation not related to study formula (Control: 13; LF-0.6: 7; LF-1.0: 19).

### Improving the detection of environmental enteric dysfunction: a lactulose, rhamnose assay of intestinal permeability in children aged under 5 years exposed to poor sanitation and hygiene [^112CZF9r]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Our study aim was to address the principal limitations of the current LM test and prospectively compare intestinal barrier function in infants with EED from at-risk populations on two continents (age below 37 months) with healthy control infants (2–13 months of age) from the USA. We describe a standardised method including administration protocol, consistent urine collection applicable at points of care in the field, and a reliable assay that can be performed at a centralised laboratory using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sensitivity and accuracy of this analytical chemistry approach has allowed our laboratory to reduce (by a factor of 5) the administered doses of rhamnose and lactulose, a change that both makes the test easier to tolerate and more likely to proceed without confounding by major alterations of intestinal motility and transit. Furthermore, by shortening the time of urine collection, the permeability deficits documented are more likely a result of permeability in the small bowel where EED changes are thought to occur and also make the test easier to perform in the resource limited settings.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^113TeMhJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Alarm signs/symptoms and evaluation focus — history, meconium timing, and documentation: Although diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, symptom description "is unreliable in infants and many children < 8 years of age". The age of onset is emphasized, and "Onset of symptoms in infants < 1 month old raises the suspicion of the presence of an organic condition such as Hirschsprung disease (HD)". Meconium timing is critical: "delayed passage of meconium by 48 hours in a term neonate suggests the need for definitive testing", yet "99% of healthy term neonates pass their first meconium before 48 hours of life", while "50% of children with HD also pass meconium within 48 hours of birth", so "the failure of passage of meconium within the first 48 hours of life, although suggestive of HD, does not establish the diagnosis". History should capture stool form using scales "such as the Bristol scale… the Amsterdam infant stool scale… or the Lane scale", and prior and present treatment; "Ideally, based on expert opinion, a 3-day diary should be used to better evaluate dietary and fluid intake", and "Medication history should be collected, including the use of oral laxatives, enemas, suppositories, herbal treatments, behavioral treatment, and other medications".

### Safe and effective pharmacotherapy in infants and preschool children: importance of formulation aspects [^112LDihw]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Safe and effective paediatric pharmacotherapy requires careful evaluation of the type of drug substance, the necessary dose and the age-appropriateness of the formulation. Generally, the younger the child, the more the attention that is required. For decades, there has been a general lack of (authorised) formulations that children are able to and willing to take. Moreover, little was known on the impact of pharmaceutical aspects on the age-appropriateness of a paediatric medicine. As a result of legislative incentives, such knowledge is increasingly becoming available. It has become evident that rapidly dissolving tablets with a diameter of 2 mm (mini-tablets) can be used in preterm neonates and non-rapidly dissolving 2 mm mini-tablets in infants from 6 months of age. In addition, uncoated 4 mm mini-tablets can be used in infants from the age of 1 year. Also, there is some evidence that children prefer mini-tablets over a powder, suspension or syrup. Other novel types of age-appropriate oral formulations such as orodispersible films may further add to the treatment possibilities. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on oral formulations for infants and preschool children, the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of dosage forms and the age groups by which these can likely be used.

### Ineffectiveness of Lactobacillus GG as an adjunct to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in children: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^117D5ToM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is an effective adjunct to lactulose for treating constipation in children.

Study Design

Eighty-four children (2–16 years of age) with constipation (< 3 spontaneous bowel movements [BMs] per week for at least 12 weeks) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which they received 1 mL/kg/day of 70% lactulose plus 10⁹ colony-forming units (CFU) of LGG (experimental group, n = 43) or a placebo (control group, n = 41) orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, and analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Treatment success, defined as ≥ 3 spontaneous BMs per week with no fecal soiling, was similar in the control and experimental groups at 12 weeks (28/41 [68%] vs 31/43 [72%], respectively; p = 0.7) and at 24 weeks (27/41 [65%] vs 27/42 [64%], respectively; P = 1.0]. Groups also did not differ in their mean number of spontaneous BMs per week or episodes of fecal soiling per week at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Adverse events and overall tolerance did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

LGG, as dosed in this study, was not an effective adjunct to lactulose in treating constipation in children.

### A dietary fiber mixture versus lactulose in the treatment of childhood constipation: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116SdRa2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a common problem in children. As first-line treatment, increased dietary fiber is often advocated. To our knowledge, however, no large studies evaluating the effect of dietary fibers in childhood constipation have been published.

Patients and Methods

A randomized, double-blind, prospective controlled study was performed. Patients received either a fiber mixture or lactulose in a yogurt drink. After a baseline period of 1 week, patients were treated for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of weaning. Polyethylene glycol 3350 was added if no clinical improvement was observed after 3 weeks. Using a standardized bowel diary, parents recorded defecation frequency during the treatment period. In addition, incontinence frequency, stool consistency, presence of abdominal pain and flatulence, necessity for step-up medication, and dry weight of feces were recorded, as were adverse effects.

Results

A total of 147 children were eligible; 12 children wished not to participate. Of the remaining children, 65 were randomized to treatment with fiber mixture and 70 to treatment with lactulose. In all, 97 children completed the study. No difference was found between the groups after the treatment period concerning defecation frequency (P = 0.481) and fecal incontinence frequency (P = 0.084). However, consistency of stools was softer in the lactulose group (P = 0.01). Abdominal pain and flatulence scores were comparable (P = 0.395 and P = 0.739, respectively). The necessity of step-up medication during the treatment period was comparable (P = 0.996), as were taste scores (P = 0.657). No serious adverse effects were registered.

Conclusions

A fluid fiber mixture and lactulose give comparable results in the treatment of childhood constipation.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

What is Known:

For disimpaction, oral laxatives are recommended as first choice treatment according to clinical guidelines, because it is considered less invasive.
There is variation in laxative policies among pediatricians.

What is New:

### Lactulose solution usp, 10 g / 15 mL (lactulose solution) [^112gQPMD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oral

Adult: The usual adult oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 mL, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.

Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of lactulose may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal-systemic encephalopathy. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose of lactulose may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose. Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later.

Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of lactulose for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose.

Pediatric: Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses. For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 mL. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued.

Rectal: When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soap suds or other alkaline agents should not be used.

Three hundred mL of lactulose should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If this lactulose enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately.

The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication. Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients. Lactulose given orally in the recommended doses, should be started before lactulose by enema is stopped entirely.

### Infant consumption of 100% lactose-based and reduced lactose infant formula in the United States: review of NHANES data from 1999 to 2020 [^114aNXJu]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

An acceptable alternative to human milk is US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-registered infant formula, which must meet the requirements of the US FDA Infant Formula Act. Human milk contains lactose, but some infant formulas may contain alternative carbohydrate sources such as corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, and sucrose. Recent research shows that infant-formula made with corn syrup solids may be associated with increased obesity risk in the first 5 years of life. A previous study found that of all formulas purchased, 59.0% were lactose-reduced. More US infants consume infant formula with nonlactose carbohydrates more frequently than is medically necessary. The purpose of this study is to use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to describe the type and prevalence of nonlactose carbohydrates consumed in infant formula.

Methods

NHANES data from 1999 to 2020 was used to perform cross-sectional analyses and analyses of comparison of prevalence over time on consumption of nonlactose carbohydrate sources in infant formulas.

Results

We identified 3709 unique infant identifiers associated with 36,084 feeding sessions. More than half of the feeding sessions involved a formula with at least one nonlactose carbohydrate. Feeding sessions involving a formula with at least one nonlactose carbohydrate increased by 163% from 1999–2004 to 2017–2020; formulas containing single or multiple nonlactose carbohydrate types account for the increase in prevalence.

Conclusions

This study highlights an increase in the consumption of infant formula containing a nonlactose carbohydrate. More studies are needed to understand the short- and long-term effects of early exposure to these carbohydrates.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^1151oKua]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Primary efficacy outcome

In the ITT population, the mean stool frequency increased from 0.7 stools/day during the baseline period to 0.8 at study end (Week 4) in the lactulose group and from 0.5 to 1.1 stools/day respectively in the PEG 4000 group (Table 2). After adjustment for stool frequency at baseline and site, stool frequency was significantly higher (p = 0.0005) in the PEG 4000 group than in the lactulose group during Week 4. The adjusted mean change from baseline in stool frequency was 0.15 stools/day in the lactulose group and 0.51 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group, corresponding to a least-squares mean difference of 0.36 stools/day [95% CI: 0.16 to 0.56]. No significant treatment × site (p = 0.13) or treatment × baseline stool frequency (p = 0.66) interactions were observed.

Table 2

Since stool frequency at baseline did not follow a normal distribution using either non-transformed or transformed data (p < 0.01; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), a post hoc analysis of the data was performed using a generalised estimating equation model for repeated measures. A significant difference between the two treatment groups was also observed in this model (p < 0.001). No treatment × site interaction was observed. The evolution of stool frequency over the treatment period is presented in Figure 2. The higher on-treatment stool frequency in the PEG 4000 group is observed at all time-points, starting from the first week of treatment.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^113drZba]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The choice of inclusion criteria in this study merits some comment. At the time the study protocol was being drawn up, the Rome III criteria for infants had not been published. We used a modification of the Rome II criteria for functional constipation in infants and preschool children (scybalous, pebble-like, hard stools for a majority of stools or firm stools two or less times/week, and no evidence of structural, endocrine, or metabolic disease present for at least two weeks). We modified the duration criterion to three months since we did not feel that treatment of very young children for one month with an experimental treatment could be justified if the constipation could be transient or self-resolving. A faecal incontinency criterion was added since this is frequently associated with functional constipation in children. However, in the event, no children were included on the basis of faecal incontinence alone. A longer minimum duration of symptoms and inclusion of a faecal incontinence criterion are present in the current Rome III criterion.

The superiority of PEG preparations over lactulose or other osmotic laxatives demonstrated in this and other studies and the limited tolerability of stimulant laxatives in children confer a favourable benefit-risk relationship on such preparations. This underlines the recommendations of current practice guidelines in which PEG preparations are identified as first-line treatment options. The NASPGHAN guidelines recommend use of mineral oil (a lubricant) or magnesium hydroxide, lactulose, sorbitol or PEG (osmotic laxatives), or a combination of lubricant and laxative, and state that PEG appears to be superior to other osmotic agents in palatability and acceptance by children. The guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) identify PEG/electrolyte solutions as the recommended first-line treatment. Effective treatment of children with constipation is important both to relieve discomfort and distress and to improve quality of life for patients and their parents. In addition, effective early management of constipation reduces the risk of persistence into adolescence and adulthood, thus reducing the overall burden and cost of disease from a public health perspective. For this reasons, the availability of effective and well-tolerated osmotic laxatives such as PEG 4000 have an important place in the management of chronic constipation in young children. A recent Cochrane review concluded that PEG preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and magnesium hydroxide for the management of childhood constipation, and was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events.

### Treatment of childhood constipation by primary care physicians: efficacy and predictors of outcome [^112Gm1aD]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Childhood constipation accounts for 3% of visits to general pediatric clinics and as many as 30% of visits to pediatric gastroenterologists. The majority of children who experience constipation and whose caregivers seek medical care are seen by primary care physicians such as pediatricians or family physicians. Little is known about how primary care physicians treat childhood constipation or the success of their treatments. With this study, we prospectively examined which treatments primary care physicians prescribe to children who present for the first time with constipation and how effective those treatments are.

Methods

A total of 119 children who were between 2 and 7 years of age (mean: 44.1 ± 13.6 months) and presented to 26 different primary care physicians (15 pediatricians and 11 family physicians) for the treatment of constipation for the first time participated in this study. Parents completed daily diaries of their child's bowel habits for 2 weeks before starting treatment recommended by their primary care physician and again 2 months after treatment. The prescribed treatment was identified by reviewing office records of the treating physicians.

Results

After 2 months of treatment, 44 (37%) of 119 children remained constipated. In the majority (87%) of cases, physicians prescribed some form of laxative or stool softener. The most commonly prescribed laxatives were magnesium hydroxide (77%), senna syrup (23%), mineral oil (8%), and lactulose (8%). In nearly all cases, a specific fixed dose of laxative was recommended; in only 5% of cases were parents instructed clearly to adjust the dose of laxative up or down to get the desired effect. In approximately half of the cases, physicians recommended some sort of dietary intervention. Some form of behavioral intervention was mentioned in the office records of approximately one third of cases; however, in most cases, little detail was provided. In 45% of cases, physicians prescribed disimpaction using oral cathartics, enemas, or suppositories followed by daily laxatives. In 35% of cases, physicians prescribed daily laxatives without any disimpaction procedure. In the remainder, physicians prescribed only dietary changes (5%), the use of intermittent laxatives (9%), or no therapy (7%). Treatment success corresponded to how aggressively the child was treated. Specifically, children who underwent some form of colonic evacuation followed by daily laxative therapy were more likely to have responded to treatment than were those who were treated less aggressively.

Conclusion

Primary care physicians tend to undertreat childhood constipation. After 2 months of treatment, nearly 40% of constipated children remain symptomatic.

### Lactulose solution, USP (10 g / 15 mL) for oral or rectal administration Rx only… [^116yYJSn]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma. Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration. There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy. In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects on breeding, conception, or parturition. Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy category B.

Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 2 or 4 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Adult: The usual adult, oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily. Pediatric: Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.

5 mL to 10 mL in divided doses. For older children and adolescents the total daily dose is 40 mL to 90 mL. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued. Three hundred mL of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If this lactulose enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately.

### Acceptability of different oral formulations in infants and preschool children [^113xH2WE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Child and parent acceptability

The data did not indicate systematic differences between the single VAS scores of the two administrations of each formulation to a child. Therefore, the mean VAS scores were used for the further evaluations. The VAS score data indicated a period or cross-over effect by which formulations administered earlier tended to have somewhat higher scores (p value < 0.0001). As a consequence, analysis started with the data of the first day only. The estimates of the mean VAS scores of the first day were: tablet 9.39 (32 children); powder 8.84 (45 children); suspension 8.26 (34 children) and 8.35 syrup (37 children); see table 2 for the CIs. The tablet scored better than the suspension even when applying a Bonferroni correction (p = 0.001: for correction multiply by 6). The other comparisons were less clear, but there was an indication that the tablet scored better than the syrup as well as the powder.

Table 2
Acceptability of four different oral formulations (n = 148 children)

Using the data from all 4 days, estimates of mean scores per formulation were obtained across the 24 different orders of administrations, each order getting the same weight. Although no clear ranking was visible between the syrup, suspension and powder, the superiority of tablet over the other three forms was more evident than by considering the data from the first day only (table 2).

The estimate of the mean number of administrations that were fully swallowed were 1.96 (tablet), 1.58 (powder), 1.70 (suspension) and 1.67 (syrup) This number was significantly higher for the tablet than for the other formulations (p value < 0.05) (table 2). The scatter-plot of the single VAS scores versus the result of the intake (data not shown) clearly illustrated that the VAS score was predictive for the result of the intake. No choking was reported.

Child and parent preference

Children and parents appeared to prefer the tablet and syrup over the suspension and the suspension over the powder (p values < 0.001). There is also some indication (p value = 0.082) that parents preferred the tablet to the syrup (table 3).

### Gastroenteritis in children [^112w212R]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent passage of unformed, liquid stools. Regardless of the cause, the mainstay of management of acute gastroenteritis is provision of adequate fluids to prevent and treat dehydration.

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute gastroenteritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clear fluids, enteral rehydration solutions (oral or gastric), lactose-free feeds, loperamide.

### Assessment of environmental enteric dysfunction in the SHINE trial: methods and challenges [^117QwDUs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A dedicated facility in the central Harare laboratory manufactures 20-mL aliquots of LM solution (containing 250 mg/mL lactulose and 50 mg/mL mannitol in sterile water). LM solution is maintained at 2°C–8°C and transported by cold chain to field laboratories, where it is carried in a dedicated cool box to the participant's home. Upon arrival, the fieldworker weighs the infant and attaches an adhesive urine bag; the mother continues to breastfeed the infant until a baseline urine sample is collected. The infant then fasts for 30 minutes prior to administration of 2 mL/kg LM solution by oral syringe or cup. A new urine bag is attached and the infant fasts for 30 minutes prior to resuming breastfeeding. The bag is emptied frequently over a 2-hour period, and each aliquot of urine is preserved with chlorhexidine to prevent microbial overgrowth, then placed in a cool box for storage. Two hours after LM ingestion, the test is stopped; if an infant has not passed any urine, the test is extended until urine is collected. The total volume of LM urine is measured in the field laboratory and samples are frozen in aliquots for subsequent measurement of lactulose and mannitol by mass spectrometry.

Plasma I-FABP is easy to measure using a commercial ELISA (Hycult Biotech, Uden, the Netherlands), reflects small-intestinal villus damage, and has a short half-life, meaning it is a dynamic marker of the intestinal epithelium; it is a useful biomarker of celiac disease, and studies are under way in Zambia to correlate I-FABP concentrations with epithelial breaches detected by confocal laser endomicroscopy (Paul Kelly, personal communication).

### Acceptability of uncoated mini-tablets in neonates – A randomized controlled trial [^112VThRt]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the suitability of drug-free solid dosage forms (2 mm mini-tablets) as an alternative administration modality in neonates in comparison with syrup.

Study Design

A total of 151 neonates (inpatients; aged 2–28 days; median 4 days) were recruited. An open, randomized, prospective cross-over study was conducted to compare the acceptability and swallowability of 2 mm uncoated mini-tablets compared with .5 mL syrup.

Results

All neonates (N = 151) accepted the uncoated mini-tablet as well as the syrup (both formulations 100%; 95% CI 97.6%-100.0%; primary objective). The level of swallowability of uncoated mini-tablets was not inferior (P < .0001), in fact even higher (difference in proportions 10.0%; 95% CI 1.37%-19.34%; p = 0.0315) compared with syrup. Both pharmaceutical formulations were well tolerated, and in none of the 151 neonates, serious adverse events occurred; particularly none of the neonates inhaled or coughed in either of the formulations.

Conclusions

The administration of uncoated mini-tablets proved to be a valuable alternative to syrup for term neonates. Our data on neonates close the age gap of prior findings in toddlers and infants: uncoated mini-tablets offer the potential of a single formulation for all age groups. These findings further shift the paradigm from liquid toward small-sized solid drug formulations for children of all age groups, as the World Health Organization proposes.

### Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea [^1153au9y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Young children with acute diarrhoea, typically due to infectious gastroenteritis, may temporarily stop producing lactase, the intestinal enzyme that digests lactose. This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness. However, there is uncertainty whether avoiding lactose-containing milk or milk products helps young children recover from acute diarrhoea more quickly.

Objectives

To assess if avoiding or reducing intake of lactose-containing milk or milk products shortens the duration and severity of illness in young children with acute diarrhoea. We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 May 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2013), MEDLINE (1996 to 14 May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 14 May 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 14 May 2013), and the reference lists of potentially relevant trials, key conference proceedings, and wrote to individuals and organizations in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of avoiding or reducing exposure to lactose in young children under five years with acute diarrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction. Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR). We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed. Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, low quality evidence). Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, moderate quality evidence). Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In young children with acute diarrhoea who are not predominantly breast-fed, change to a lactose-free diet may result in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea and reduce treatment failure. Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding. There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^11357evC]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Three study populations were assessed, namely a safety population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication, an intent to treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients in the safety population for whom at least one post-treatment measure of stool frequency was available, and a per protocol (PP) population, defined as all patients in the ITT population without a major protocol deviation. The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the ITT population and a sensitivity analysis in the PP population. The safety analysis was performed in the safety population.

In the case of premature study discontinuation, the last data value recorded in the patient diary was assigned according to the principle of last observation carried forward (LOCF). In the case of missing data for stool on a given day during any week, the mean of the values on other days in the same week was used to interpolate the missing one. For a given week, the mean value was computed only if at least four of the seven daily assessments of the week in question were documented.

The primary objective of the study was to detect a difference in stool frequency during the fourth week between the two treatment groups. Stool frequency during the fourth week of treatment was assessed across treatment arms using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which site and baseline stool frequency (during Week -1) were treated as covariates. In addition, the 95% adjusted confidence interval for the treatment effect was also estimated. Interactions between treatment group on the one hand and site and baseline stool frequency on the other were estimated.

Because of potential deviations from normality of stool frequency, (as established by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test both on raw and transformed data using log, square root and Box-Cox transformations), a post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the treatment effects using a generalised estimating equation model with a Poisson distribution for repeated measures, taking into account baseline stool frequency, site, treatment, study period and interactions between treatment and study period, treatment and site and treatment and baseline stool frequency.

### Lactulose: mannitol diagnostic test by HPLC and LC-MSMS platforms: considerations for field studies of intestinal barrier function and environmental enteropathy [^116KjJW4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Mannitol is known to be naturally present in urine in low concentrations, several times lower than the levels excreted in dosed children. In this instance, roughly 5% of randomly selected results had mannitol concentrations in the range of what was found in urine from undosed children. Lactulose is not found in natural foods; however, it is present in ultra-high-temperature milk in concentrations of 0.72 to 1.60 mmol/L. Children in the community from which these samples were drawn receive lactulose frequently in the form of yogurt and cereal preparations. Thirty-one percent of urinary lactulose concentrations were in the range of what was also found among undosed children (by LC-MSMS 1). Camilleri et al have reported that excretion of lactulose continued between 8 and 24 hours after dosing in healthy adults; it is plausible that dietary lactulose was not fully cleared by the pre-urine collection fast. It also raises the possibility of interfering substances, most likely to be other dietary disaccharides or breakdown products of milk oligosaccharides most likely to be preferentially present in younger children who received breast milk during the challenge test.

Although the L:M test is the most commonly used assay for intestinal permeability and has been used for > 2 decades, few standards have been adopted in implementation, the assessment of analyte concentrations, or the interpretation of results. Methodologically, dosages and urine collection times vary significantly between studies. For example, according to the protocols of 2 well-cited studies, the dosage of lactulose for a 10-kg infant would vary from 8 to 4 g and dosages of mannitol would be 2 and 1 g, respectively, whereas in the present study, a child of the same size would receive 5 g lactulose and 2 g mannitol. Ideally, these probes would have no activity on the host in general and on the gastrointestinal system in particular; however, the doses of lactulose in these studies are in the pharmacologic range for its use as a hyperosmolar laxative and published protocols exceed the dose used for constipation and are in the range of that used for portal systemic encephalopathy. As a consequence, transit time is accelerated and this likely decreases the absorption of mannitol in the assay, whereas lactulose absorption is increased in the presence of hyperosmolar solutions.

### Lactulose (Enulose) [^112FcBxJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oral

Adult: The usual adult, oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 ml, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.

Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of Lactulose may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal-systemic encephalopathy. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose of lactulose may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose.

Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later.

Continuous long-term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy. The dose of lactulose for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose.

Pediatric

Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded. As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses.

For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued.

Rectal

When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used.

Three hundred mL of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes. Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours. If the enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly, it may be repeated immediately.

The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication. Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients. Lactulose, given orally in the recommended doses, should be started before Lactulose by enema is stopped entirely.

Regarding the use of lactulose PO (also known as Constulose, Enulose, Generlac, Kristalose) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Indiscriminate or excessive use can lead to diarrhea and dehydration, which may affect maternal nutritional and hydration status, particularly during the first trimester. Lactulose should only be used during pregnancy if the potential therapeutic benefits justify its usage, and pregnant women should seek qualified medical advice prior to use, rather than self-medicating without advice.

### Double-blind randomized evaluation of clinical and biological tolerance of polyethylene glycol 4000 versus lactulose in constipated children [^115GugkU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the safety of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 laxative without additional salts in pediatric patients.

Study Design

This was a 3-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, lactulose-controlled, parallel study enrolling 96 ambulatory constipated children aged 6 months to 3 years, treated daily with 4–8 g PEG or 3.33 g-6.66 g lactulose. Total protein, albumin, iron, electrolytes, and vitamins B9 (folates), A and D (25OHD3) were measured in blood before and after treatment (day 84) in a central laboratory.

Results

The percentage of children with at least one value out of normal range at day 84 with respect to baseline status (with or without at least one value out of normal range), i.e. the primary endpoint, was 87% and 90% in the PEG and lactulose groups, respectively, without any difference between groups. The whole blood parameters showed no qualitative or quantitative treatment-related changes. Vitamin A values were above normal range in 56% and 41% of children at baseline versus 33% and 36% at day 84 in the PEG and lactulose groups, respectively. Iron values were similarly under normal range in 47% and 51% at baseline versus 42% and 51% at day 84. Clinical tolerance was similar for both treatments except for vomiting and flatulence, which were significantly higher with lactulose. Significantly higher improvements were evidenced with PEG regarding stool consistency, appetite, fecaloma and use of additional laxatives.

Conclusion

This 3-month study in 96 constipated children aged 6 months to 3 years confirms the long-term tolerance of PEG 4000 in pediatrics and indicates a PEG efficacy similar to or greater than that of lactulose.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^112WqSay]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline — consensus process, grading, and scope: Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions was graded, and three consensus meetings were held in September 2012, February 2013, and May 2013 using a 9-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 9 = fully agree). Consensus was defined a priori as > 75% of members voting 6, 7, 8, or 9, and consensus was reached for all questions. The guideline presents 2 algorithms; one pertains to the infant from birth to 6 months (instead of 1 year) and the other to the older child, reflecting that infants < 6 months old have different diagnostic considerations. Both algorithms apply to any child presenting with constipation of at least 2 weeks' duration and include evaluation and treatment options for "intractable" constipation. This guideline should be revised every 3 to 5 years.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^112k5UT5]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

Stool frequency was determined for Weeks -1 (baseline), 1, 2 and 3 and 4 as the mean number of stools passed per day for the seven days of the week. The primary efficacy variable was stool frequency at Week 4. Secondary efficacy measures were stool consistency, ease of stool passage and the occurrence of subjective symptoms associated with defecation, namely cramping, flatus and anal irritation at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed from discussion with the parents at Visits 3 and 4. Incidence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) was documented over the entire four-week study period. All AEs were coded using the NCI Thesaurus. Compliance was assessed by counting returned medication sachets. If the patient took < 70% of the scheduled amount of medication intake in Week 4 or < 80% over the entire treatment duration, this was regarded as a major protocol violation.

Statistical analysis

The number of patients to be included in the study was determined through a priori power calculations. The anticipated on-treatment mean stool frequency was 0.9 ± 0.6 per day in the lactulose treatment group and 1.3 ± 0.7 per day in the PEG 4000 treatment group. These projections were derived from a previous comparative study of lactulose and PEG 3350 in chronic constipation in adults, no studies in children having been documented at the time the study protocol was designed. A sample of 42 eligible patients in each treatment group would be required to detect a difference in mean stool frequency of 40% between the PEG 4000 and lactulose treatment groups with a power of 80% at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a drop-out rate of 16%, it was thus planned to recruit a total of 50 patients per treatment group.

### The fifty billion dollar question: does formula cause necrotizing enterocolitis? [^1173eJMR]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbohydrate

The carbohydrates in human milk consist of lactose and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Lactose is a disaccharide that requires enzymatic digestion by lactase to release the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Lactase activity in preterm infants is lower than for term infants, but lactose intolerance in preterm infants is uncommon. HMOs are abundant in human milk with a wide variety of structures and sizes and yet are not digestible by the infant due to lack of the glycosidases necessary to digest them. The question as to why a mother expends significant energy to synthesize these molecules which have no nutritional value for her infant is a compelling one. The discovery that only a limited number of intestinal microbes (Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species) are able to digest and transport HMOs into their cytoplasm suggests that one of the primary roles of HMOs is to shape the developing intestinal microbiome of the infant. In animal models, HMOs also stimulate mucin production and have anti-inflammatory properties.

The primary carbohydrates in preterm infant formulas are maltodextrin and corn syrup solids due to their rapid digestibility and high glycemic index. Both are polymers of glucose with predominantly alpha 1,4 linkages that are digested by maltase which is expressed at higher levels in the preterm infant than lactase. In the preterm piglet, maltase expression is low and administration of maltodextrin triggers maldigestion and a NEC-like illness. It has been proposed that incomplete digestion of dietary maltodextrin in the preterm intestine stimulates dysbiosis, inflammation, and NEC, however, a randomized trial in 306 preterm infants comparing maltose-containing formula to lactose-containing formula showed no differences in NEC incidence but less feeding intolerance in the maltose-containing formula group. If maldigestion of maltodextrin were common in formula-fed preterm infants, one would expect to see frequent feeding intolerance, diarrhea, and poor growth which is not the case.

### Lactulose solution USP 10 g / 15 mL… [^112HRkbt]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

For the treatment of constipation. In patients with a history of chronic constipation, lactulose solution therapy increases the number of bowel movements per day and the number of days on which bowel movements occur. Since lactulose solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. Since lactulose solution contains galactose and lactose, it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician. Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose solution for more than six months should have serum electrolytes measured periodically. In studies in mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.

Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 3 or 6 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement. Note: Some patients have found that lactulose solution may be more acceptable when mixed with fruit juice, water or milk. NDC 0121–0577–08: 8 fl oz bottles NDC 0121–0577–16: 16 fl oz bottles.

### PEG 3350 vs. lactulose for constipation in children… [^114pwzao]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Synopsis: In this study, investigators compared two osmotic laxatives, lactulose and PEG 3350, in children six months to 15 years of age who met two of the following four criteria: fewer than three bowel movements per week; encopresis more than once a week; large amounts of stool every one to four weeks; and palpable abdominal or rectal mass. Children with an organic cause for constipation, such as Hirschsprung's disease, were excluded. Before randomization, all children underwent an untreated one-week run-in period, during which symptoms were recorded and use of oral laxatives was not allowed. They received one enema per day for three days at the end of the week to clear any stool in the rectum. Children six months to six years of age were randomly assigned to receive 6 g of lactulose or 2. 95 g of PEG 3350 per day; children six to 15 years of age received 12 g of lactulose or
5. 9 g of PEG 3350 per day.

After one week, treatment effect was assessed. The dosage was increased by one dose per day if symptoms persisted or was cut in half if the child was having diarrhea. A stimulant laxative also was given if the symptoms had not improved from baseline. Patients were evaluated again at two, four, and eight weeks, at which time the dosage could be adjusted. The primary outcome, evaluated using per-protocol analysis, was treatment success at eight weeks, defined as at least three bowel movements per week and encopresis no more than once every two weeks. Although per-protocol analysis is less robust than intention-to-treat analysis, in this case only four of 50 patients in the PEG 3350 group and five of 50 patients in the lactulose group withdrew prematurely, making bias unlikely. Bottom Line: PEG 3350 and lactulose increase stool frequency and decrease encopresis in children with functional constipation.

Overall treatment success was more likely in the PEG 3350 group and, other than its taste, PEG 3350 was somewhat better tolerated than lactulose.

### Evaluation and treatment of constipation in infants and children [^112HPcLk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Constipation in children usually is functional and the result of stool retention. However, family physicians must be alert for red flags that may indicate the presence of an uncommon but serious organic cause of constipation, such as Hirschsprung's disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon), pseudo-obstruction, spinal cord abnormality, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, cystic fibrosis, gluten enteropathy, or congenital anorectal malformation. Treatment of functional constipation involves disimpaction using oral or rectal medication. Polyethylene glycol is effective and well tolerated, but a number of alternatives are available. After disimpaction, a maintenance program may be required for months to years because relapse of functional constipation is common. Maintenance medications include mineral oil, lactulose, milk of magnesia, polyethylene glycol powder, and sorbitol. Education of the family and, when possible, the child is instrumental in improving functional constipation. Behavioral education improves response to treatment; biofeedback training does not. Because cow's milk may promote constipation in some children, a trial of withholding milk may be considered. Adding fiber to the diet may improve constipation. Despite treatment, only 50 to 70 percent of children with functional constipation demonstrate long-term improvement.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^116G2YdZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The study has a number of strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include the randomised, double-blind comparative design, which has not been used extensively in studies of constipation in paediatric populations, the qualification of the reference centres and the low rate of study discontinuations and of major protocol violations. Since the two preparations compared in this study have a different taste, there was some risk of compromising the blinding, although the medication was provided in identical sachets, using an identical dosing regimen. The mean treatment exposure was high in both groups and the acceptability of the two preparations was high, with compliance superior to > 80% in all but three patients in both treatment arms. Data collected using a patient diary filled in by the parents cannot be independently ascertained, which may compromise their accuracy. However, the use of a patient diary represents a pragmatic solution to data collection in the community setting and such patient-related outcome measures are recommended in current guidelines for follow-up assessment of bowel habits in children. In the PP population, but not in the ITT population, there was an indication of an interaction between treatment and study centre, with the treatment effect being more pronounced in patients treated at site 1 compared to site 2. However, it should be noted that the change from baseline in stool frequency at site 2 was still nearly twofold higher in the PEG 4000 group than in the lactulose group, and that the study was insufficiently powered to detect significant between-group differences at the site level. We have no obvious explanation for the treatment × site interaction in the PP population, but this may possibly relate to the fact that four of the five major protocol violations in the lactulose group related to patients enrolled at site 2.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^113fvra5]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Lactulose — chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults who fail or are intolerant to over-the-counter (OTC) therapies: The panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Two RCTs in elderly participants evaluated lactulose syrup, including a multicenter Netherlands study with 103 participants using an initial dose of 15 mL of 50% lactulose daily for 3 weeks, with dose reduced by half after 3 consecutive days with defecation, doubled if no defecation occurred for more than 48 hours, then reduced back to 15 mL after 3 consecutive days; a U.S. study included 55 participants who received 30 mL daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. Lactulose is approved by the FDA for constipation at 10–20 g (15–30 mL or 1–2 packets) daily and may be increased to 40 g (60 mL or 2–4 packets) daily if needed. Bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

### Lactulose (Generlac) [^111TX8ve]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Since Generlac Solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics.

In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g., hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required.

Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

Drug Interactions

There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy.

Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with Generlac Solution.

Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portalsystemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate Generlac Solution dosage has been achieved.

### Oral lactase for infantile colic: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^112gTZUJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 162 children (99 boys and 63 girls) were included in the study; 154 completed the follow-up of 4 weeks (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of the infants enrolled in the study in Table 1 show crying duration in study and control group was comparable (Table 1). Over three-fourths of infants in both groups were exclusively breast fed. All infants not on breast feeds were receiving normal term infant formula feeds.

Baseline characteristics of the infants enrolled in the study

Table 2 presents the results of crying and fussiness at the end of 4 weeks and also after the end of each week. The mean daily duration of crying or fussing showed a progressive decline from first to fourth week in both the groups but was significantly lesser in infants receiving lactase in comparison to those receiving placebo, at the end of every week of assessment. Considering crying and fussing duration for all 4 wks of study, the mean (SD) duration of crying and fussing was 155.1 (101.4) min while in case of placebo group it was 234.1 (127.1) min. Infants receiving lactase had a mean reduction in crying or fussing time by 35.1–52.2 min/day. The reduction in crying or fussing duration was higher during 3 rd and 4 th week of intervention (Table 2). After a period of four weeks, better parental satisfaction in terms of perception of their child' mood, alertness, activity and oral intake was observed in infants receiving lactase in comparison to placebo (Table 3).

The residual volume of drug was within 20% of that expected on basis of calculated dose in all the participants. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated in both the groups; 43 infants had mild AEs such as vomiting, regurgitation of feeds, constipation and diarrhea that resolved (Table 3) without the need of any other medication or hospitalization.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^115cX1Ah]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

The second studyinvestigated PEG 4000 versus lactulose. Ninety six children were included in this randomised double-blind parallel group study that was carried out in 30 paediatric centres. Twenty two children were aged between 6 and 12 months and had at least a 1-month history of ≤ 1 stool per day. The remaining 74 were aged 1–3 years and had at least a 3-month history of ≤ 3 stools per week.

The randomisation strategy was not described. Medications were supplied as dry powders for the patient to reconstitute and a double-dummy approach employed in order to conceal treatment allocation. In patients under 1 year of age, treatment was limited to 4 g PEG or 3.33 g lactulose. In older children this could be doubled, if required, with glycerol microenemas being used if this still proved inadequate. No other laxatives were permitted. The primary outcome of this study was a biochemical assessment of safety after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, although stool frequency was also evaluated as a secondary outcome.

Eight children failed to complete the study (four in each group), although only one (in the lactulose group) dropped out due to treatment failure. The median daily dose of PEG was 4 g in both babies and older children. For lactulose, the dose was 3.33 g in babies and 3.66 g in older children. Thirty per cent of children in the PEG group required enemas in the first half of the study and 17% in the second half versus 43% and 41% in the lactulose group (p = 0.012). At 6 weeks, the median numbers of stools per week in the PEG and lactulose groups, respectively, were 8.5 vs 11, p = NS (babies) and 8 vs 6, p < 0.013 (toddlers). At 12 weeks, the equivalent results were 8.5 vs 11.5, p = NS (babies) and 7 vs 6, p = NS (toddlers).

### PEG 3350 versus lactulose for treatment of functional constipation in children: randomized study [^117AuUvh]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and tolerance of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) and lactulose for the treatment of functional constipation in infants and children.

Methods

This randomized, multicenter study covered 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up of patients with functional constipation. Patients were randomized (central randomization) to receive either PEG or lactulose. The primary end points were the number of defecations per week after 12 weeks of treatment and improvement in stool consistency of at least 2 points in the Bristol scale. The secondary end point was the presence of adverse events. Bowel movements ≥ 3 per week and stool consistency ≥ 2 (Bristol scale) were considered as successful treatment.

Results

We enrolled 102 patients (M 57, F 45) aged 3.62 ± 1.42 years and 88 completed the study. At week 12, good clinical outcome was achieved in 98% (PEG) and 90% (lactulose). The PEG group had more defecations per week compared with the lactulose group (7.9 ± 0.6 vs 5.7 ± 0.5, P = 0.008) and both groups had similar frequency of defecation with pain (5% vs 5%, P = 0.9), stool retention (7% vs 10%, P = 057), large volume of stools (30% vs 31%, P = 0.9) and hard stools (7% vs 13%, P = 0.58). There were more patients with side effects in the lactulose group (15 vs 23, P = 0.02), mostly bloating and abdominal pain.

Conclusions

PEG 3350 is more effective and causes fewer side effects than lactulose in the treatment of constipation in infants and children.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^116NRRqj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Functional constipation — maintenance pharmacologic therapy in children — The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, with a starting dose of 0.4 g/kg/day and dose adjustment according to clinical response; the addition of enemas to the chronic use of PEG is not recommended in children with constipation; if PEG is not available, the use of lactulose as the first-line maintenance treatment is recommended; based on expert opinion, the use of milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as an additional or second-line treatment (quality of evidence: very low).

### Improving the detection of environmental enteric dysfunction: a lactulose, rhamnose assay of intestinal permeability in children aged under 5 years exposed to poor sanitation and hygiene [^113tyxdd]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Administration of sugars

The oral solution consisted of 200 mg monosaccharide (L-rhamnose, TCI product code R0013, Portland, Oregon, USA) and 1000 mg disaccharide (lactulose, TCI product code L0140 Portland, Oregon, USA) in 10 mL sterile water. Study personnel administered the entire solution over a period of 5 min to the infant. Annotations were collected for notable issues during dosing (infant spitting up, refusal, etc).

Post-dose urine collection

The urine bag was placed on the infant 30 min post dosing and collected over the subsequent 60 min (30–90 min post dosing). Oral intake (water, breast milk, formula, no solid foods) after administration of sugar solution was encouraged with a goal of 4 mL/kg intake over 30 min to promote urine production. If no urine was present at the end of 60 min, the collection was continued until urine was present in the bag but no longer than an additional 30 min.

Samples were labelled with participant study ID and with a pre-dose or post-dose tag. Samples were stored at −20°C until analysis. Batched samples were placed on dry ice and delivered to the Immunochemical Core Laboratory (ICL) at Mayo Clinic for analysis.

Methodology of HPLC MS:MS

The methodology was performed as recently published with the following modifications to account for the molecular weight transition for rhamnose. The following transitions were monitored: mannitol analyte (181.05/89), ¹³C₆ mannitol IS (186.9/60.9), lactulose analyte (341/101) ¹³C₁₂ lactulose I.S. (353/167), rhamnose analyte (163/58.8). The rhamnose analyte was quantified using the mannitol I.S. Mannitol, lactulose and rhamnose were used to make the standard curves and the sources for the internal standard were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Analytical validation of the assay is included in online supplementary materials.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^116FEVrT]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Although the superiority of PEG over other osmotic laxatives has been well documented in adults, the evidence base is more restricted in paediatric populations. The number of well-designed randomised, double-blind clinical trials that have evaluated PEG in the management of chronic constipation in children remains relatively limited, and the number of subjects evaluated is low. These include two placebo-controlled studies of PEG 3350, three studies comparing PEG 3350 to lactulose, two comparing PEG 4000 to lactulose, one comparing PEG 3350 to magnesium hydroxide, two comparing PEG 4000 to magnesium hydroxide and two comparing PEG 3350 to liquid paraffin oil. The majority of these studies included older children and little data is available in children younger than three years of age. Further clinical trials would be helpful to extend the available evidence base, in particular studies performed in young children. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy of PEG 4000 to that of lactulose in the treatment of young children aged between 12 to 36 months with chronic constipation.

SPECIMEN COLLECTION, TRANSPORT, AND PROCESSING

Infant blood is collected at each time-point into a PAXgene tube (PreAnalytiX GmbH, Switzerland) for subsequent transcriptomic analysis, and an EDTA tube (BD Biosciences) for point-of-care hemoglobin measurement (HemoCue Hb 301, Angelholm, Sweden), CD4 count and HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction testing (HIV-exposed infants only), plasma storage (for biomarker analysis), and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation (for flow cytometry). Salivary samples are collected using oral swabs (Salimetrics LLC, Carlsbad, California); stool samples are collected into plain tubes without fixative, prior to ingestion of lactulose-mannitol (LM) solution, and urine is collected prior to and for 2 hours after administration of LM solution (see below). Samples are carried in cool boxes to field laboratories, where they are processed and aliquoted for storage at −20°C or −80°C with a backup generator.

### Lactulose (Kristalose) [^1132SGoo]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Since KRISTALOSE®(LACTULOSE) For Oral Solution contains galactose and lactose (less than 0.3 g/10 g as a total sum), it should be used with caution in diabetics.

Information for Patients

In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician.

Laboratory Tests

Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose for more than six months should have serum electrolytes (potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide) measured periodically.

Drug Interactions

Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility.

There are no known animal data on long-term potential for mutagenicity.

Administration of lactulose syrup in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent (v/w) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity.

In studies in mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose syrup up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 3 or 6 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lactulose is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Favorable acceptance of mini-tablets compared with syrup: a randomized controlled trial in infants and preschool children [^115HArxB]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate acceptability of 2 mm solid dosage forms (mini-tablets) as an alternative administration modality in young children in comparison with syrup.

Study Design

Three hundred six pediatric in- and outpatients aged 6 months-5 years (51 in each of 6 age groups) were recruited. An open, randomized cross-over study was conducted to compare acceptability and capability to swallow 2 mm uncoated or coated mini-tablets vs 3 mL syrup.

Results

In the overall patient population of 306 children, the acceptability of uncoated mini-tablets was superior to syrup (difference in proportions 14.8%, 95% CI 10.2–19.4; P < .0001). In line with this finding, the level of capability to swallow was higher for uncoated mini-tablets compared with syrup as well (difference in proportions 12.3%, 95% CI 5.4–19.3; p = 0.0008). All 3 pharmaceutical formulations were well tolerated, and none of the 306 children inhaled or coughed because of the syrup or the uncoated mini-tablet; only 2 of the 306 children (both in age group 0.5–1 year) coughed because of the coated mini-tablet, in both cases without clinical relevance.

Conclusions

Mini-tablets are a valuable alternative to syrup for children 6 months-6 years of age and are more acceptable compared with liquid formulation. Regulatory bodies such as Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency are encouraged to take our data into account for guideline updates and future drug approval processes.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper: plant-based milks [^113pgcxP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Infant and toddler milk intake — human milk, infant formula, and cow's milk (CM) — is outlined as follows: The universally preferred milk for infants is human milk. Breast milk or infant formula should be an infant's sole food for the first 4 to 6 months of life. In infants not receiving breast milk, iron fortified infant formula should be the source of milk in the diet to 1 year of age, and by 1 year of age most infants are weaned to some form of "milk". USDA recommendations are to consume 2 to 3 servings per day of dairy products per day for a well-balanced, nutritionally complete diet; this amount provides approximately 25% to 30% of total energy needs of 1- to 3-year-olds.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^112oJRzX]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study performed in Thailand showed PEG 4000 to be more efficacious than lactulose in increasing stool frequency in young children with chronic constipation and to be well-tolerated. This finding adds to the growing evidence base that PEG osmotic laxatives are more effective than lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children. In terms of safety, the tolerability of PEG 4000 was satisfactory and broadly comparable to that of lactulose. Both treatments were well accepted and no clinically relevant safety issue was identified.

These findings are consistent with those of a large Chinese study in 216 older children aged from eight to eighteen years which also demonstrated greater efficacy of PEG 4000 compared to lactulose. A meta-analysis published by the Cochrane collaboration estimated the on-treatment difference in stool frequency between patients receiving PEG preparations and those receiving lactulose to be 1.09 stools per week [95% CI: 0.02 to 2.17]. Our findings (on-treatment intergroup difference of 0.3 stools/day) are towards the upper end of the range of the estimate of the meta-analysis.

The results of our study also complement those of a previous one evaluating the safety of PEG 4000 and lactulose in 96 children aged from six months to three years, performed in France. This study demonstrated the good long-term safety of PEG 4000, and our findings are consistent with this. Efficacy was a secondary outcome in the French study, which found both PEG 4000 and lactulose to be effective in relieving constipation with greater improvements observed in the PEG 4000 group with respect to stool consistency, appetite, new-onset faecal impaction and recourse to enema use. As in this French study, we were also able to demonstrate a benefit of PEG 4000 over lactulose with respect to stool consistency and ease of stool passage, although not with respect to associated symptoms. In the meta-analysis published by the Cochrane collaboration, minor adverse events occurred with similar frequency in children treated with PEG preparations and with lactulose.

### Reporting outcome measures of functional constipation in children from 0 to 4 years of age [^116ZoRER]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Functional constipation (FC) often begins in the first year of life. Although standard definitions and criteria have been formulated to describe FC, these are rarely used in research and clinical practice. The aim of the study is to systematically assess how definitions and outcome measures are defined in therapeutic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of infants with FC. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Studies were included if it was a (systematic review of) therapeutic RCT, children ≤ 4 years old, they had FC, a clear definition of constipation was provided, and were written in English. Quality was assessed using the Delphi list. A total of 1115 articles were found; only 5 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four different definitions were used, of which only 2 used the internationally accepted Rome III criteria. Defecation frequency was used as primary outcome in all included trials and stool consistency in 3 trials. Two trials involving infants investigated new infant formulas, whereas the third RCT evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic strain. The 2 trials including infants up to 4 years of age compared polyethylene glycol without electrolytes (PEG4000) with lactulose and milk of magnesia. All of the trials used nonvalidated parental diaries. Different definitions and outcome measures for FC in infants are used in RCTs. Disappointingly, there is a lack of well-designed therapeutic trials in infants with constipation. To make comparison between future trials possible, standard definitions, core outcomes, and validated instruments are needed.

Intestinal permeability in preterm infants represents a critical balance between absorption of nutritional agents and protection from dangerous pathogens. This study identified the relationship between feeding type (human milk and formula) and intestinal permeability as measured by lactulose to mannitol ratio in preterm infants in the first postnatal month.

Study Design

Sixty-two preterm (≤ 32 weeks of gestation) infants had assessment of feeding type and evaluation with enteral lactulose and mannitol administration and urinary measurement at three time points in the first postnatal month.

Results

Infants who received the majority of feeding as human milk (> 75%) demonstrated significantly lower intestinal permeability when compared to infants receiving minimal or no human milk (< 25% or none) at postnatal days 7, 14, and 30 (p = 0.02, 0.02, and 0.047, respectively). When infants receiving any human milk were compared to infants receiving formula only, a significant difference existed at day 7 and day 14 but not for day 30 (p = 0.04, 0.02, and 0.15, respectively). With evaluation over the complete study period, exclusively formula-fed infants demonstrated a 2.8-fold higher composite median lactulose/mannitol ratio when compared with those who received any human milk. Infants who received > 75% of enteral feeding as mother's milk demonstrated a 3.8-fold lower composite median ratio when compared to infants receiving < 25% or no mother's milk.

Conclusion

Preterm infant intestinal permeability was significantly decreased for those receiving human milk versus formula in a dose-related manner in the first postnatal month.

### Older infant-young child "Formulas" [^111CXLzz]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The category of "formulas" directed at older infants and toddlers 6 to 36 months of age has increased in prominence over the last years but is characterized by lack of standardization in nomenclature and composition as well as questionable marketing practices. There has been uncertainty and misperception regarding some of the roles of these beverages in ensuring adequate childhood nutrition. The aim of this clinical report is to review the context, evidence, and rationale for older infant-young child formulas, followed by recommendations.

### Lactase for infantile colic: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^1131uqUe]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Infantile colic is excessive crying for no apparent reason in an otherwise healthy infant. Although its physiopathology is not completely understood, therapies usually target gastrointestinal symptoms. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) analyzes the efficacy of lactase supplementation in infantile colic. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for RCTs evaluating lactase supplementation in infants up to 6 months old with infantile colic. Out of six RCTs including 394 patients, three reported a significantly shorter crying time in the lactase group than in the placebo group, while the other three found no significant difference between groups. Of the two studies that performed the hydrogen breath test, only one reported a significant reduction in exhaled hydrogen levels. The pharmacological approach to infantile colic remains debatable, and new studies with standardized diagnostic criteria and outcomes are required to guide lactase supplementation in clinical practice.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^112BVfM8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Maintenance therapy for childhood constipation — PEG with or without electrolytes is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment. A starting dose of 0.4 g/kg/day is recommended and the dose should be adjusted according to the clinical response. Addition of enemas to the chronic use of PEG is not recommended. Lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, if PEG is not available. Based on expert opinion, the use of milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as an additional or second-line treatment. Maintenance treatment should continue for at least 2 months. All symptoms of constipation symptoms should be resolved for at least 1 month before discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should be decreased gradually. In the developmental stage of toilet training, medication should only be stopped once toilet training is achieved.

### Effects of iron supplements and iron-containing micronutrient powders on the gut microbiome in Bangladeshi infants: a randomized controlled trial [^112Npqf5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Study design

This microbiome sub-study recruited the final 1093 children from the BRISC trial (ACTRN12617000660381), set in rural parts of Rupganj Upazila, Bangladesh. Briefly, BRISC was a three-arm, individually randomized, placebo-controlled trial that recruited 3300 children aged eight months and randomized them 1:1:1 to receive one of iron syrup (and placebo MNPs); iron, zinc, ascorbic acid, vitamin A and folate-containing MNPs (and placebo syrup) or placebo (placebo syrup and placebo MNPs) daily for three months, reflecting WHO guidelines. Iron interventions were 12.5 mg ferrous sulphate in syrup and 12.5 mg ferrous fumarate in MNPs. Individual block randomization method was used, with stratification by sex and region (Union) to maintain balance between intervention arms. Blinding was achieved through the use of identical packaging that carried the randomization code for each participant. All participants were required to take two interventions each day: a syrup and a powder. Participants in the trial attended major visits at three time points: baseline – 8 months of age; midline – 11 months of age, immediately following completion of the intervention; and endline – 20 months of age. Data regarding daily adherence to the intervention and parent-reported diarrhea incidence (using the WHO definition of ≥ 3 loose or liquid stools per day) was obtained by field staff during weekly visits over the 3-month intervention period. The primary outcome was child development after intervention, with a range of other developmental, anthropometric and laboratory outcomes also measured. For this sub-study, we aimed to include the final 1000 participants randomized during the final 6 months of recruitment.

Samples were collected at baseline, midline and endline visits. We sought to perform 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from all stool samples. This allows analysis of microbiome alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic profiling at the genus level. Additionally, in approximately one-third of samples, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing (with priority given where canonical baseline, midline and endline samples were available), enabling us to further interrogate composition to species level and to perform functional analysis. All sample collection, processing, and bioinformatic and statistical data analysis were planned while blinded to the intervention arm.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^117VVDqo]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic constipation is frequent in children. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PEG 4000 and lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind study enrolled 88 young children aged 12 to 36 months, who were randomly assigned to receive lactulose (3.3 g per day) or PEG 4000 (8 g per day) for four weeks. The primary efficacy variable was stool frequency during the fourth week of treatment. Secondary outcomes were the number and frequency of subjective symptoms associated with defecation at each visit.

Results

Stool frequency was comparable in the two groups at baseline (lactulose: 0.7 ± 0.5; PEG 4000: 0.5 ± 0.55). Mean stool frequency increased from 0.70 ± 0.50 stools/day at baseline to 0.80 ± 0.41 at Week 4 in the lactulose group and from 0.50 ± 0.55 to 1.10 ± 0.55 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group. A significant difference was observed in the adjusted mean change from baseline, which was 0.15 stools/day in the lactulose group and 0.51 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group, with a least-squares mean difference of 0.36 stools/day [95% CI: 0.16 to 0.56]. With respect to secondary outcome variables, stool consistency and ease of stool passage improved more in the PEG 4000 group (p = 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, the majority of which were mild.

Conclusions

PEG 4000 has superior efficacy to lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children and is well tolerated.

### Growth and tolerance of formula with lactoferrin in infants through one year of age: double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^111CuQcG]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Tolerance

Parent-reported mean study formula intake (fl oz/day; data not shown) increased from day 30–120 for all groups by gender, indicating normal intake for LF-0.6 and LF-1.0 groups when compared to the Control for this time period (examples: females at day 30, 25.9–26.9 fl oz/day and day 120, 33.3–34.2 fl oz/day; males at day 30, 28.2–30.0 fl oz/day and day 120, 35.0–35.7 fl oz/day). Intake for female participants by group was similar at all time points assessed. Statistically significant group differences in intake were noted among males at days 180 (Control: 36.5 fl oz/day; LF-0.6: 31.9 fl /day; LF-1.0: 33.7 fl oz/day; Control vs LF-0.6, P < 0.05) and 275 only. However, by day 180, mean reported study formula intake began to decline in general for both male and female participants which could be expected as parents and caregivers likely begin to offer complementary foods to infants at approximately 4–6 months of age. Parent-reported gassiness and fussiness were similar among groups at all study time points (data not shown). Using 24-h recall, the amount of gas most commonly reported was "slight amount" or "moderate amount" up to 180 days of age and "none at all" or "slight amount" by 275 and 365 days of age. Fussiness was most often characterized as "slightly fussy" or "not at all fussy" in all groups. No significant group differences in mean (± SE) stool frequency (number/day) were detected at any time point assessed (Table 4). No group differences in mean (± SE) stool consistency (with categories corresponding to 1 = hard, 2 = formed, 3 = soft, 4 = unformed or seedy, 5 = watery; Table 4) were detected at baseline. Significant differences in stool consistency were detected between Control and investigational formula groups from day 30 through 180. By category, the primary differences at these study time points were more infants with a formed and fewer infants with an unformed or seedy stool consistency in the Control compared to LF-0.6 and LF-1.0 groups. The majority of infants in all groups from day 30–365 were reported to have a soft stool consistency. There were no significant differences among study formula groups by day 275, possibly reflecting the increased amount of complementary feeding in older children consuming less formula.
