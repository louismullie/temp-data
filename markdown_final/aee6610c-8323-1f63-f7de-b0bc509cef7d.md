## Question

Care plan for stroke patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a care plan for a stroke patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework and evidence hierarchy. Then, I should verify the acute phase priorities, including stroke unit care and reperfusion. Next, I will examine functional assessment and discharge planning. After that, I need to detail secondary prevention and risk factor management. Then, I will consider rehabilitation planning and transitions. I should also integrate mental health, cognition, and caregiver support. Finally, I will address long-term follow-up, quality improvement, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. The most consistent, high-credibility anchors are the AHA/ASA primary care scientific statement and the ESC integrated care ABC pathway, which together emphasize patient-centered, multidisciplinary care across the continuum with three pillars: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy, Better functional and psychological status, and Cardiovascular risk factor and Comorbidity optimization, all grounded in shared decision-making and iterative follow-up [^46f73e1d] [^6ed85325] [^e9d7e441].

> I will now examine the acute phase. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for stroke units and reperfusion. Stroke unit care reduces mortality and poor outcomes, and this is among the most robust signals in stroke care; prehospital and interfacility systems should prioritize transport to stroke-capable centers, with thrombectomy-capable centers when large-vessel occlusion is suspected, and protocols should be standardized and audited for quality [^85da1828] [^3837e17c] [^ede4d8e1]. I should confirm that functional assessment before discharge is mandatory; yes, AHA/ASA recommends formal ADL/IADL, communication, and mobility assessments prior to discharge and incorporation into the transition plan, which materially affects rehabilitation placement and safety [^935c1612] [^050de9c4].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and transitions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought discharge planning reduces mortality, but I need to check that. The Cochrane review shows reduced length of stay and readmissions without a clear mortality benefit, so I should correct that claim and emphasize functional outcomes and readmission reduction instead [^8c3a8858]. I should double-check that early supported discharge and community rehabilitation are associated with better outcomes; indeed, national audit analyses show community rehabilitation pathways yield the best outcomes and direct discharge without follow-up carries higher mortality, reinforcing the need for structured post-acute support [^427c27ff] [^2eeea466]. Let me also verify that standardized transition tools and telehealth can mitigate rural access barriers; AHA/ASA supports individualized discharge planning and telehealth for follow-up and education, which is particularly relevant for underserved regions [^fcbc06ee].

> Now, I need to ensure secondary prevention is explicit and actionable. The AHA/ASA secondary prevention guideline and ESC integrated care statements converge on antithrombotic therapy tailored to etiology, aggressive risk factor control with BP, lipid, and diabetes targets, and lifestyle modification, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation, with shared decision-making to align choices with patient values and bleeding risk [^9e52f40c] [^6ed85325]. I should confirm that medication adherence is a persistent problem; COMPASS-CP data show nearly one in five patients are nonadherent early after discharge, underscoring the need for pharmacist-led reconciliation, education, and adherence monitoring at each visit [^87dbc48a].

> Let me consider rehabilitation planning and intensity. I should confirm that rehabilitation should begin within 24–48 hours once stable and be multidisciplinary; VA/DoD and AHA/ASA guidelines endorse early, coordinated rehabilitation with patient-centered goal setting and periodic reassessment of potential, which improves function and participation [^d0829338] [^66b1266f]. But wait, what if intensity is insufficient? Canadian data show many patients receive far less than the recommended 180 minutes per day of therapy, so I need to emphasize intensity targets and advocate for adequate coverage and access to outpatient and community-based programs [^81319d64].

> I should confirm mental health and cognitive screening protocols. Post-stroke depression and anxiety are common and impair adherence and recovery; screening alone is insufficient, but collaborative care models that combine screening with structured follow-up and treatment improve outcomes, so I need to embed PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with referral pathways and care coordination [^79c1a972]. Hold on, I should verify cognitive assessment cadence; AHA/ASA recommends routine screening for cognitive impairment and standardized measures to track recovery and guide supports, which should be repeated at follow-up visits [^facf1135].

> Next, I should review caregiver and social determinants of health. Let me think about the practical steps: provide written medication and nutrition plans, arrange home safety assessments, and connect families with community resources and peer support; these steps reduce readmissions and improve caregiver preparedness, especially when coordinated by a single point of contact [^fd8a7b6f] [^5f82e962]. I need to ensure we screen for health literacy, transportation, and financial barriers, because these materially affect adherence and recovery trajectories and should be documented and addressed in the care plan [^e7df9691].

> I will now examine long-term follow-up and quality improvement. The first primary care visit should occur within 1–3 weeks of discharge to establish the care cycle, confirm etiologic workup, reconcile medications, and set patient-centered goals, with subsequent visits tailored to risk factor stability and functional needs; this cadence is associated with better risk factor control and fewer gaps in care [^46f73e1d]. I should double-check that advance care planning is underutilized; indeed, only about 45% of stroke survivors have advance directives, and documentation is inconsistent, so I need to proactively revisit goals of care and ensure documents are accessible in the EMR [^0de61d00] [^d0074f7a].

> But wait, what about special populations and equity. For young adults with stroke, I need to ensure transition readiness, vocational rehabilitation, and reproductive counseling, ideally within dedicated young stroke programs, because their needs and risks differ markedly from older adults [^a74e9fdf]. For rural and resource-limited settings, I should confirm that tele-rehabilitation and telestroke can maintain quality when in-person services are sparse, and that policy advocacy for coverage and workforce development is essential to close access gaps [^fcbc06ee] [^c1852ef3].

> Let me synthesize a practical, phased care plan while keeping it evidence-aligned. In the acute phase, prioritize stroke unit admission, reperfusion when indicated, and early functional assessment; in the subacute phase, implement structured discharge planning with 24–48 hour callbacks, home safety evaluation, and medication reconciliation; in the chronic phase, deliver the ABCs with antithrombotic therapy matched to etiology, rehabilitation at guideline-concordant intensity, and risk factor optimization with quarterly visits early on, then semiannually if stable; across all phases, embed shared decision-making, caregiver education, and iterative quality improvement using registry feedback and team-based audits [^46f73e1d] [^6ed85325] [^935c1612] [^fcbc06ee].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations are measurable and actionable. Key quality indicators include stroke unit treatment rate, door-to-needle and door-to-groin times, discharge functional assessment completion, early follow-up attendance, antithrombotic appropriateness, BP control to less than 130/80 when tolerated, LDL less than 70 mg/dL in high-risk patients, HbA1c less than 7% when indicated, rehabilitation intensity minutes per day, PHQ-9 screening and treatment response, and advance care planning documentation; tracking these metrics and closing loops with teams and patients yields the best chance of improving outcomes at the population level [^cdc53588] [^82f47973] [^9e52f40c].

A stroke care plan should be **individualized and multidisciplinary**, spanning acute management, rehabilitation, secondary prevention, and long-term support. It must include **early mobilization and rehabilitation** to maximize recovery, **aggressive risk factor management** to prevent recurrence, and **patient and caregiver education** to support adherence and self-management. Regular follow-up should monitor function, mood, cognition, and social needs, with advance care planning integrated early. Evidence-based models like COMPASS and early supported discharge improve outcomes, and care should be coordinated across settings to ensure continuity and safety [^967519d0] [^2eeea466] [^46f73e1d].

### Action plan for stroke in Europe 2018–2030 [^83aa1fd5]. European Stroke Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Research and development priorities

What are the experiences and needs of stroke survivors at different times during their lifespan?
What are the needs of different cohorts of stroke survivors? This needs to include patient- and carer-reported outcomes, and to address the challenges of stroke survivors with multiple morbidities, and their carers, in order to enable the design of optimal care pathways.
What would a model of best care and long-term support look like? This should include the provision of three to six-month and annual reviews and specific roles to provide holistic coordinated support.
What products and services (digital and physical) would support self-management, community integration, education and healthcare?
How can high-quality information and training to help non-specialist staff, especially social care staff, be targeted? It is envisaged that this will involve research around staffing levels, core competencies and the involvement of non-governmental and non-profit-making bodies such as charities and voluntary groups.

Targets for 2030

Appointing government-level individuals or teams responsible for championing life after stroke and ensuring that national stroke plans address survivors' and their families' long-term unmet needs. Minimum standards set for what every stroke survivor should receive regardless of where they live.
Formalising the involvement of stroke survivors and carers, and their associations, in identifying issues and solutions to enable the development of best patient and support practices.
Establishing, through national stroke care plans, the support that will be provided to stroke survivors, regardless of their place of residence and socioeconomic status.
Supporting self-management and peer support for stroke survivors and their families, by backing stroke support organisations
Supporting the implementation of digitally-based stroke self-help information and assistance systems.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^ae5db218]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Post-stroke care planning — plans arise from collaboration between patient and clinician, are based on patient-identified problems, apply tailoring and sequencing or prioritizing care, and involve negotiation of a plan of care with timely follow-up; action plans emphasize achievable goals, and visits conclude with plans to reinforce successful behavior and address gaps. Because patients often miss doses or prematurely discontinue medication therapy, active adherence monitoring is important and can reveal the cause for falling short of treatment goals.

### Planning after stroke survival: advance care planning in the stroke clinic [^8204bd91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in secondary stroke prevention and acute stroke treatment have moved stroke from the third‐ to the fifth‐leading cause of death in the United States. 1 Even so, stroke survivors face high rates of subsequent poststroke illness and death, with 1‐ and 5‐year mortality estimates of 41% and 60%, respectively. 2, 3 This excess mortality can be attributed in part to increased cardiovascular deaths, as well as increased rates of cancer, accidents, and suicides. 4, 5 Nearly two thirds of stroke‐related deaths occur outside of the acute hospital setting. 1 A high rate of stroke recurrence is another important contributor to poststroke death and disability: one quarter of the nearly 800 000 Americans with stroke each year are survivors of a previous stroke. 6 History of transient ischemic attack reduces survival by 20% over 9 years, and even magnetic resonance imaging evidence of minor or subclinical stroke doubles the risk of overt stroke. 7, 8 People who survive a stroke have a 2‐fold increased risk of developing dementia over those without stroke, 9 and while 1 in 10 develops dementia after a first stroke, the incidence rises to 1 in 3 following a recurrent stroke. 10

In addition to facing an elevated risk for future stroke and disability, many stroke survivors will be unable to communicate their values and treatment preferences in the acute setting. Stroke survivors are therefore a prime target for advance care planning (ACP), the process by which patients plan for, prepare, and communicate their personal values and goals for future medical care. ACP can give patients a voice when they cannot speak for themselves. The American Academy of Neurology recently identified discussions around patients' goals of care and documentation of advance directives (ADs) as major quality improvement goals for patients hospitalized with neurologic illness. 11 In addition, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 2014 scientific statement on palliative and end‐of‐life care in stroke makes explicit recommendations for patient‐ and family‐centered care and goals of care discussions. 12

### How do stroke survivors experience rehabilitation goal setting and plans to support their rehabilitation? A qualitative study [^1ea16381]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patient involvement and goal setting are essential components of stroke rehabilitation. However, ensuring continuity and patient engagement can be challenging due to different settings and time points throughout rehabilitation journey. This study aimed to explore stroke survivors' experiences with their rehabilitation plan across hospital-to-municipality transition.

Materials and Methods

This qualitative study involved individual interviews with stroke survivors who received standard rehabilitation plans for municipal rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Participants shared their reflections on their cross-sectoral rehabilitation experience. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis outlined by Braun and Clarke.

Results

We interviewed 17 participants from eight municipalities within the hospital's service area. Analysis identified two main themes: Misalignment of rehabilitation goals and plans with patient needs and Navigating Inequity in Rehabilitation: Unmet Needs and Personal Strategies. Four subthemes included Challenges in Defining Goals, Lack of Patient Involvement in Goal Setting, Seeking Supplementary Care to Meet Unmet Needs, and Living Within and Beyond a Standardized System.

Conclusion

Rehabilitation goals are not always clearly communicated to stroke survivors, and insufficient patient-centered approaches suggest potential gaps in the rehabilitation system. Additionally, timing of rehabilitation plans often does not align with patients' needs, indicating a need for more adaptable and responsive rehabilitation pathways.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^46f73e1d]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Post-stroke primary care — cycle and initial visit timing are outlined as follows: A first post stroke visit is generally within 1–3 weeks of discharge to establish the foundation for post-stroke management, followed by a cycle that includes Establish/Confirm the Patient & Family's Perspective (contentment with present course; gaps between aspirations and status), Identify Unmet Needs (knowledge; functional/physical; psychological; social), General Goals (achieve patient-centered care; prevent recurrent brain injury; maximize function; prevent late complications; optimize quality of life), Characterize Control of Chronic Stroke Risk Factors, Affirm the Management Plan (set specific goals; address etiologic evaluation; gaps between patient's goals/aspirations and status; unmet needs; risk factor control; consultations), Implement the Plan (educate patient/carers; implement treatment; coordinate care; address barriers; schedule return visit), and a Follow-Up Visit to solicit the patient's agenda and review and update stroke and medical/social/medication history. After the first visit, it is helpful to document a brief narrative of the patient's stroke to anchor stroke-specific care for future visits, and foundational work for every visit includes monitoring the consequences of the stroke and updating the medical and social history. The burden of ongoing symptoms is common: Approximately 60% of stroke survivors have some neurological symptoms, and 5% to 50% have moderate disability, requiring some assistance with basic activities of daily living.

State of current services

There are relatively few robust data available across Europe on longer term management and care after stroke. Where data exist, collection has been relatively unsystematic, and the service data are therefore both patchy and anecdotal; little attention has been paid to developing, let alone evaluating, longer term care. Stroke survivors seem ill prepared for the transition from rehabilitation, and many studies report survivors and their carers feeling 'abandoned'. There is evidence of six-month reviews being conducted in some European countries, but there is a conspicuous reduction in data from survivors or their carers beyond this time. Similarly, there is no Europe-wide agreed model for the long-term support for children or young people who have had a stroke. Their needs, and those of their families, are typically provided by community services that usually also cover cerebral palsy, acquired brain injury and allied neurological conditions. However, it is rare for a child to receive intensive residential rehabilitation services after discharge from hospital. Families may have access to specialist tertiary level support around the time of diagnosis, but continuing access to this support varies and typically tapers off over time. Overall, there appears to be little evidence of holistic and coordinated support. There is no pathway for survivors, who often find themselves on parallel paths for other conditions (e.g. depression and diabetes); longer term review may enable stroke survivors and their carers to better follow their individual disease management plan. Most importantly, there is no model of what best care looks like following discharge from specialist services. The large and growing number of stroke survivors with long-term needs must be addressed; we need to develop minimum standards of care and measure these.

There is a growing interest in collecting patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data that would best reflect patients' views about their care and provide additional information beyond the traditional clinician-reported measures. Patient representatives have played an important role in the development of these measures. The American Heart Association has advocated broader use of PROMs in both clinical practice and research. Similarly, the Swedish Stroke Registerhas gradually broadened to more fully cover the quality of services and late outcomes after stroke, through follow-up at three months and at one year after the event. There is an emphasis on PROMs relating to ADL, self-perceived health, health-related quality of life, mood, pain, satisfaction with stroke services, rehabilitation and community support; all of these are important for stroke survivors. Questions about the need for support for the carer may also be included.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^b6244008]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Implementing the plan and scheduling the return visit — self-management support is a foundation of chronic disease management and continues with education for knowledge (about health, disease, prognosis, therapy, when to call 9-1-1) and skills in monitoring, problem solving, and decision making; self-monitoring for control of BP, diabetes, and weight is now part of care pathways in professional guidelines and provides feedback that can be combined with self-management to achieve better risk control. Emerging evidence suggests that team care involving a registered nurse or pharmacist can improve chronic disease management, and many disciplines may have a role; a return visit should be scheduled at an interval that accounts for the patient's condition, risk factor stability, and risk for failure to achieve goals.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8c3a8858]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Discharge planning outcomes — Using data from 8098 patients, hospital length of stay and hospital readmissions were "statistically significantly" reduced for patients admitted with a medical diagnosis who were allocated to discharge planning (mean difference length of stay −0.91, 95% CI −1.55 to −0.27, 10 trials; readmission rates RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, 12 trials), whereas no significant differences were found for mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78–1.25, 5 trials) or being discharged from hospital to home (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93–1.14, 2 trials); the authors concluded that a "discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition" but that effects on mortality, health outcomes, and cost remained unclear.

Rehabilitation

State of the art

In the Helsingborg Declaration of 2006, the goal for 2015 was that all stroke patients in Europe would have access to a continuum of care from acute management to appropriate rehabilitation, delivered in dedicated stroke units.

Among adults, stroke is the most common cause of new disability leading to more than one impairment that could affect daily activities (Table 4). Rehabilitation has been defined by the WHO as 'a set of measures that assist individuals, who experience or are likely to experience disability, to achieve and maintain optimal functioning in interaction with their environments'. It is instrumental in enabling people with functional limitations to remain in or return to their home or community, live independently and participate in education, work and civic life. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) includes the right to rehabilitation, but the 2017 SAFE report on Stroke in Europehas clearly shown that access to rehabilitation varies across Europe. In the same year, WHO made a call for action, 'Rehabilitation 2030', to address the significant rehabilitation needs across the world and the substantial apathy towards these needs shown by many governments.

Care in hospital – stroke units and early rehabilitation

Acute stroke care, skilled nursing care and specialist rehabilitation are all core aspects of a comprehensive stroke unit, and treatment in such facilities has been shown to reduce mortality and disability. Rehabilitation includes occupational, physical and speech and language therapy, with input from psychologists and social workers as necessary. It should involve a multidisciplinary approach from stroke physicians in a comprehensive stroke team, and an ordered plan for discharge from hospital with documented responsibility for continuing rehabilitation needs in the community.

Patients and carers need information about stroke, rehabilitation and planned discharge and follow-up. This information improves knowledge, patient satisfaction and reduces depression. How this information is best delivered remains unclear, but active involvement of both patients and family members seems to be beneficial.

### Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations: rehabilitation, recovery and community participation following stroke. part one: stroke rehabilitation planning for optimal care delivery, 7th edition update 2025 [^e82130d0]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations 7 th edition update of the Rehabilitation, Recovery and Community Participation module is presented in three parts. This publication, Part One of the series, reflects the growing and changing body of research evidence available to guide planning, ongoing screening and assessment, management, education, and support of individuals with stroke, their families, and caregivers. This module provides guidance for the planning and delivery of coordinated and seamless systems of care from acute stroke onset to return to community settings by an interdisciplinary team of healthcare providers with expertise in stroke. These recommendations were developed with active involvement of people with lived experience of stroke at all phases. These recommendations are intended to support the progress achieved during the initial recovery stages and enable individuals with stroke to resume life roles and leisure activities as best as possible, to achieve optimal recovery goals. Evidence for effective rehabilitation therapies and support for individuals with stroke and their families continues to emerge and gaps in knowledge should drive future research.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^49f26161]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Ongoing support, listening to the patient and providing personalized education, information, and advice in simple terms with consistent messages are important throughout the patient journey and continuity of care is essential. Integrated care for stroke advocated in this consensus document requires streamlining of care pathways and MDT working to optimize patient care and improve patient outcomes. Central to the success of integrated care is greater patient and family/caregiver involvement in planning and co-producing support packages and input and feedback on optimizing stroke care pathways.

### COMPASS-CP: an electronic application to capture patient-reported outcomes to develop actionable stroke and transient ischemic attack care plans [^87dbc48a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are clinical tools that measure patients' goals of care and assess patient-reported physical, mental, and social well-being. Despite their value in advancing patient-centered care, routine use of PROs in stroke management has lagged. As part of the pragmatic COMPASS (Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services) trial, we developed COMPASS-Care Plan (CP), a clinician-facing application that captures and analyzes PROs for stroke and transient ischemic attack patients discharged home and immediately generates individualized electronic CP. In this report, we (1) present our methods for developing and implementing COMPASS-CP PROs, (2) provide examples of CP generated from COMPASS-CP, (3) describe key functional, social, and behavioral determinants of health captured by COMPASS-CP, and (4) report on clinician experience with using COMPASS-CP in routine clinical practice for care planning and engagement of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients discharged home. Methods and Results We report on the first 871 patients enrolled in 20 North Carolina hospitals randomized to the intervention arm of COMPASS between July 2016 and February 2018; these patients completed a COMPASS follow-up visit within 14 days of hospital discharge. We also report user satisfaction results from 56 clinicians who used COMPASS-CP during these visits. COMPASS-CP identified more cognitive and depression deficits than physical deficits. Within 14-day posthospitalization, less than half of patients could list the major risk factors for stroke, 36% did not recognize blood pressure as a stroke risk factor, and 19% of patients were nonadherent with prescribed medications. Three-fourths of clinicians reported that COMPASS-CP identifies important factors impacting patients' recovery that they otherwise may have missed, and two-thirds were highly satisfied with COMPASS-CP. Conclusions The COMPASS-CP application meets an immediate need to incorporate PROs into the clinical workflow to develop patient-centered CP for stroke patients and has high user satisfaction.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^867aa7c9]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Competing disease presentations in the context with acute stroke remains a challenge and may also lead to deterioration and chronic impairment. Over-diagnosis and treatment based on cardiac markers alone needs to be avoided.

Central to the success of integrated care for stroke is greater patient and family/caregiver involvement in planning and co-producing support packages, and input and feedback on optimizing stroke care pathways.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^81319d64]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, there have been continued efforts to develop and implement clinical guidelines on stroke rehabilitation that emphasize services to support transitions as patients move from one stage to another in their stroke recovery. One example is Part Two of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations, which focuses entirely on transitions with recommendations on: 1) supporting stroke patients & their families (e.g. screening & assessment, use of telemedicine, information on peer support), 2) education (e.g. individualized assessment of needs & development of education plan, self-management skills training), 3) interprofessional care planning (e.g. deliberate plan for collaboration and information transfer among health care providers, goal-setting with patient/family/caregiver, home assessments), 4) community participation (e.g. education and screening, exercise programs, rehabilitation and management to return to driving, referrals to vocational services to resume social and life roles, advance care and palliative care), and 5) long-term care (e.g. assessment, rehabilitation and restorative care).

Ultimately, the burden of stroke in Canada is expected to rise due to an increase in the number of people experiencing and/or surviving a stroke, which is a consequence of various forces including population growth, aging, and improvements in acute stroke care. Similar trends are expected in countries across the globe, with stroke-related disability burden showing a 12% increase worldwide since 1990. This "underscores a great need for strengthening stroke rehabilitation systems as a mainstay of treating stroke-related illness." (pg. 403). As noted above, the evidence of the long-term effectiveness of community-based rehabilitations services is lacking. However, we do know that the significant accomplishments seen in acute stroke care have not been matched by improvements to post-acute stroke rehabilitation services in the community. In Ontario (Canada), many stroke patients do not receive the required intensity of rehabilitation therapy recommended by the Canadian Stroke Best Practices (received 69 min/day compared to the recommended 180 min/day), and only 50% of stroke patients access post-acute (inpatient and/or community-based) rehabilitation.

### Cluster randomized controlled trial: clinical and cost-effectiveness of a system of longer-term stroke care [^ee5e263e]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Randomization and Masking

The unit of randomization was the SCC service randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the control or the intervention group. Randomization was stratified by the quality of the local stroke unit (National Sentinel Stroke Audit median score of 65 based on 2006 data); annual number of referrals to the SCC service; SCCs working alone or within a community team; and by geographical area. A method of obtaining a balanced randomization from these covariates based on a method by Carter and Hoodwas used.

Control

Patients in services allocated to the control group received the SCC service in accord with the existing local policies and practices. After randomization, the control group SCCs were asked to complete time logs for all patients documenting the number and duration of contacts, and the time spent coordinating actions, note writing, and discussing the patient in multidisciplinary team meetings if these took place.

Intervention

The SCC services allocated to the intervention group provided care according to the LoTS care system of care. This comprises a framework of 16 structured assessment questions (linked to evidence-based treatment algorithms and reference guides) that directly relate to longer-term stroke problems previously identified by patients with stroke and their carers, and related prompts provided in a care plan. The care plan also includes a goal and action planner to be completed after each contact (patients and carers). This system of care was supported by a training program and detailed manual, underpinned by a problem-solving approach (Table 1; details are provided in the online-only Data Supplement). The number of contacts was not specified but determined by the SCCs' usual practice and patient need. The key principles being that all assessment questions were asked and that goals and action plans were identified and reviewed with service responses being provided as appropriate within the context of the services available and the patient's own environment.

Table 1.
Components of the Longer-Term Stroke Care System of Care

Recruitment was opened 4 to 6 months after the initial training meeting, providing sufficient time for the implementation of the system of care into standard practice. Compliance with the intervention was predefined by the trial team as including at least 12 (75%) of the 16 assessment areas recorded as discussed on the care plan during the first patient contact.

### Planning after stroke survival: advance care planning in the stroke clinic [^90bc563c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

When there is a lack of ACP, the responsibility of acute medical decision making typically falls on families and physicians. The families of patients with severe acute stroke have reported significant distress with surrogate medical decision making resulting from a need to make decisions under time pressure and having to make decisions that may result in death. 13 The literature suggests that ACP may alleviate the confusion, anxiety and conflict that families experience when making surrogate decisions. 14, 15, 16 Patients who have completed ACP are more likely to receive care that is congruent with their wishes, 17 and this may be especially important for patients with stroke and their families, who have reported a dearth of preparation and discussion around what a future with severe disability might look like compared with the possibility of death. 18

Despite the importance of ACP for stroke survivors, the documentation of patient preferences, surrogate decision makers, and ADs in the medical record are still relatively uncommon, even among critically ill stroke patients with a high risk of death, 19 and most of the ADs available are not applicable for severe acute stroke. 20 Barriers to ACP in the weeks following an acute stroke include a perceived lack of urgency for such conversations, patients' lack of awareness of the severity of their illness, and a reluctance to engage in difficult conversations among healthcare providers. 21 Nor should ACP conversations be limited to the acute setting; patient preferences are known to change over time, and goals‐of‐care discussions should be periodically revisited to assess for changes. 12

Therefore, the aim of this quality improvement project was to explore the prevalence, experiences, and influencing factors around goals‐of‐care and ACP conversations among the stroke survivors who presented to our tertiary stroke clinic. We believe that a clearer understanding of these elements is the first step in our efforts to increase rates of ACP discussions and documentation, and ultimately to improve patient‐centered care and goal‐concordant health outcomes.

### Action plan for stroke in Europe 2018–2030 [^fc77db7a]. European Stroke Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Two previous pan-European consensus meetings, the 1995 and 2006 Helsingborg meetings, were convened to review the scientific evidence and the state of current services to identify priorities for research and development and to set targets for the development of stroke care for the decade to follow. Adhering to the same format, the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) prepared a European Stroke Action Plan (ESAP) for the years 2018 to 2030, in cooperation with the Stroke Alliance for Europe (SAFE). The ESAP included seven domains: primary prevention, organisation of stroke services, management of acute stroke, secondary prevention, rehabilitation, evaluation of stroke outcome and quality assessment and life after stroke. Research priorities for translational stroke research were also identified. Documents were prepared by a working group and were open to public comments. The final document was prepared after a workshop in Munich on 21–23 March 2018. Four overarching targets for 2030 were identified: (1) to reduce the absolute number of strokes in Europe by 10%, (2) to treat 90% or more of all patients with stroke in Europe in a dedicated stroke unit as the first level of care, (3) to have national plans for stroke encompassing the entire chain of care, (4) to fully implement national strategies for multisector public health interventions. Overall, 30 targets and 72 research priorities were identified for the seven domains. The ESAP provides a basic road map and sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030.

### How do patients pass through stroke services? Identifying stroke care pathways using national audit data [^26a3c780]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study show that the routes that patients take through stroke services from initial admission to discharge from specialist stroke service routes are extremely varied, with over 800 different routes identified. However, we were able to consolidate these into nine summary routes and three pathways with common characteristics. These highlighted key ways of configuring overarching stroke services. We have characterized the patients who followed each route, their therapy, outcomes and the costs of inpatient care. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to map out stroke services in this way. We believe it provides a useful framework to conceptualize the way stroke services are organized and the information it contains can be used to plan, benchmark and develop stroke services. The length of stay could be particularly useful as a benchmark to estimate expected discharge dates for patients treated by services with as similar configuration.

Many of the observed differences between the pathways could be explained by differences in the profile of stroke severity: those at the extremes of stroke severity were more likely to follow the direct discharge pathway and less likely to need therapy. Unsurprisingly, the length of stay was short on the direct discharge pathway as it involved a relatively high proportion of patients with very/mild stroke who were discharged quickly and also patients who died. Despite this, the cost of inpatient care was not lower on the direct discharge pathway than on Routes 4 and 5 (community rehabilitation after discharge from admitting team).

Consideration needs to be given to the high proportion of patients with mild stroke who were discharged without any community rehabilitation. There is growing recognition that people with 'mild' strokes often suffer enduring impairments but the limitations they impose on activity and participation only become apparent once patients are discharged and attempt to function within their own environment. – This highlights the need for all stroke survivors to be actively monitored and supported after discharge with easy, rapid access to rehabilitation services when needed.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^6ed85325]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Consensus statements

The co-occurring and inter-linked nature of CVD requires an integrated care action plan to prevent, identify, treat, and rehabilitate people. This targets the prevention of recurrent stroke, improves patient functional status and symptoms, and manages cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and lifestyle changes

A post-stroke ABC pathway is proposed as a more holistic approach to integrated stroke care and would include three pillars of management:

A: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy.
B: Better functional and psychological status.
C: Cardiovascular risk factors and Comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes).

Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be targeted to the underlying comorbidity, for example, anticoagulation for patients with AF.

When stroke patients have both AF and vascular disease, anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice.
In high-risk stable atherosclerotic vascular disease patients without AF, combination therapy with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin provides some benefits on CVD events (including on stroke) even in the absence of associated AF, but at the risk of more major bleeding.
In the absence of AF, antiplatelet drugs are used for secondary stroke prevention for non-cardioembolic stroke with either aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Both the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin and ticagrelor and aspirin have been found to be superior to aspirin alone for 90-day treatment of acute minor strokes and high-risk TIAs. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has also been utilized for intracranial atherosclerotic ISs.

Better functional and psychological status requires care packages and management pathways to be established and implemented, including tailored rehabilitation and personalized appropriately to the patient's needs, both in hospital, during rehabilitation, and post-discharge. Assessment of PSD, anxiety, and cognitive impairment should be undertaken as part of post-stroke care, with appropriate intervention where required.

Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are common in stroke patients, and all need to be considered and addressed in a holistic manner, with treatment targets as per CVD prevention guidelines.

A considerable burden of previously unknown AF can be detected when long-term monitoring is applied in at-risk patients.

Across the stroke continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

### A person-centered approach to poststroke care: the COMprehensive post-acute stroke services model [^967519d0]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Many individuals who have had a stroke leave the hospital without postacute care services in place. Despite high risks of complications and readmission, there is no standard in the United States for postacute stroke care after discharge home. We describe the rationale and methods for the development of the COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) care model and the structure and quality metrics used for implementation. COMPASS, an innovative, comprehensive extension of the TRAnsition Coaching for Stroke (TRACS) program, is a clinician-led quality improvement model providing early supported discharge and transitional care for individuals who have had a stroke and have been discharged home. The effectiveness of the COMPASS model is being assessed in a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 41 sites across North Carolina, with a recruitment goal of 6,000 participants. The COMPASS model is evidence based, person centered, and stakeholder driven. It involves identification and education of eligible individuals in the hospital; telephone follow-up 2, 30, and 60 days after discharge; and a clinic visit within 14 days conducted by a nurse and advanced practice provider. Patient and caregiver self-reported assessments of functional and social determinants of health are captured during the clinic visit using a web-based application. Embedded algorithms immediately construct an individualized care plan. The COMPASS model's pragmatic design and quality metrics may support measurable best practices for postacute stroke care.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^21fb1028]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — patient-centered care and shared decision making emphasize individualized, evidence-based care, communication, and alignment with patient values. Regardless of the care setting, all patients should have access to individualized evidence-based care, and good communication is essential and should be supported by evidence-based information tailored to each patient's needs. A whole/holistic health approach empowers and equips individuals to meet their personal health and wellbeing goals, and patient-centered care can decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in providers, and improve treatment adherence. This CPG encourages providers to practice shared decision making, in which providers, patients, and patient care partners consider clinical evidence of benefits and risks as well as patient values and preferences to make decisions regarding the patient's treatment, and providers are encouraged to use shared decision making to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, and preferences.

### Setting priorities for a discharge plan for stroke patients entering nursing home care [^fd8a7b6f]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To agree priorities for the structure and content of the discharge process for stroke patients entering nursing home care.

Design

A formal priority-setting exercise using the Nominal Group Technique.

Participants

A panel of 12 members of a multidisciplinary team from a hospital and community setting with experience in the management of stroke patients on a daily basis.

Results

Agreement was good and improved during the process (Kendall coefficient of concordance 'W increased from 0.48 to 0.58 for physical care needs, 0.45 to 0.75 for care needs and 0.56 to 0.72 for the discharge process). The priorities for discharge were: 1) Plans need to be co-ordinated by one person 2) Clear written information on medication should be provided 3) Clear written information on nutritional needs should be provided.

Conclusion

Agreement was reached by a panel of clinicians on an evidence-based discharge plan for stroke patients entering nursing home care.

MDTs and the roadmap to potentiate integrated stroke care

There are multiple pathologies that may lead to an IS: diseases of the arteries and diseases of the heart, thrombosis-mediated and thrombosis-unrelated, embolic and small-vessel disease, atherosclerotic, and non-atherosclerotic (Figure 3). The myriad of cardiac, vascular, haematologic, and other underlying aetiologies highlights that stroke is not caused by a single disease. Moreover, many prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities are risk factors for these pathways leading to stroke such as arterial hypertension, DM, dyslipidaemia, heart failure, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity to name only the most prevalent. Hence, engaging in the prevention of a first or recurrent stroke is a challenging task that requires competency in the management of the complex interactions outlined above.

To add further to the complexity of integrated care for stroke, there are many challenges when treating a patient with acute and subacute ischaemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Although only a minority of stroke patients arrive rapidly enough to hospital settings, timely recanalization of an occluded cerebral artery is crucial as it may markedly improve patient outcomes, especially for those patients treated with endovascular treatment, with one of the best number-needed-to-treat metrics in medicine. Recanalization treatments have advanced in recent years from the technically-simple intravenous administration of alteplase in the early 90 s to the modern innovative interventional endovascular procedures which are further enhanced by sophisticated imaging and artificial intelligence.

Most stroke patients develop several typical complications of cardiovascular, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, and neurosurgical nature, which need to be handled in a holistic multi-system approach. Such treatment is best provided on specialized stroke units (indeed, the Action Plan for Stroke in Europe 2018–2030 targets to treat 90% or more of all patients with stroke in Europe in a dedicated stroke unit as the first level of care) and the interdisciplinary care concepts of close monitoring and early treatment of multiple complications are the key principle of stroke unit care — treating not the stroke, but the patients with stroke. Simultaneously, the diagnostic quest for the underlying cause occurs in parallel with acute stroke management and incorporates sophisticated multimodal diagnostic tools that add to the complexity by bringing up puzzling diagnostic challenges and uncertainties. Clearly, a MDT is required to contribute specialized expertise from a range of specialties involved as individually required.

Integrated care for stroke — why do we need this, peri- and post-stroke

The co-occurring and inter-linked nature of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease (together termed CVD) requires a combined action plan to prevent, identify, treat, and rehabilitate people. To deliver this requires a multi-faceted action on several fronts, involving both the health and social care workforce. It is axiomatic that increasing the collaboration and integration of the cardiac- and stroke-specialist workforces, within an integrated care service model will ensure effective and efficient. Indeed, there needs to be concerted and co-ordinated action to address the underlying risk factors for CVD, requiring greater investment in, and implementation of, disease prevention and health promotion policies.

The importance of an 'integrated care' approach has been applied to other chronic conditions. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a common cause for ischaemic stroke (IS), the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway has been proposed as an integrated care approach with three central pillars: 'A' Avoid stroke (with Anticoagulants); 'B' Better symptom management, with patient-centred decisions on rate or rhythm control; and 'C' Cardiovascular and Comorbidity risk optimization. This provides a streamlined approach to management that is applicable to whether the AF patient is managed by any healthcare professional, either the general practitioner or the hospital-based specialist (whether cardiologist or non-cardiologist), minimizing the possibility of conflicting information from healthcare professionals. Indeed, inconsistent information to patients has been associated with poorer patient adherence with their management plan. An integrated care approach is increasingly recommended in guidelines.

### From guidelines to clinical practice in care for ischaemic stroke patients: a systematic review and expert opinion [^0997eebe]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The care for patients suffering from ischaemic stroke (IS) is rapidly evolving and treatment guidelines, provided by international stroke organizations, are continuously updated based on available evidence. However, a gap between daily clinical practice and guideline recommendations remains, emphasizing the need for improved translation of guideline recommendations into practice. Adequate and evidence‐based treatment of IS is crucial for reducing mortality and morbidity. Stroke care improvement projects have direct impacts on stroke care processes and patient outcomes.

In the context of these initiatives, adequate evaluations of quality measures play an important role. Quality measures are objective evaluations developed to support self‐assessment and improvement at the provider, hospital or healthcare system level. They are typically key components of the care process, actionable and aligned with evidence. Currently, there are a multitude of guidelines on the care for IS patients as well as reviews of these guidelines. However, for clinicians it is often not clear which recommendations have the greatest impact on quality of care and are easiest to implement in daily routine. For individual hospitals, care providers and multidisciplinary teams, it remains difficult to choose which actions to initiate first, and what the effort and effect will be in their specific context. Moreover, it is challenging to map and improve the entire care process all at once. As stated by Yu et al. further work is needed toward the consideration around the dimensions of applicability, that is, actionability, feasibility and validity, of key measures. Evaluations of the recommendations on these dimensions could help to set improvement priorities.

Aims

To help healthcare professionals to set these improvement priorities the aim was to first give an overview of the existing recommendations in the literature for IS care, by conducting a systematic review. Second, the extracted recommendations were scored by experts on their applicability, that is, actionability, feasibility and validity, as a means to facilitate their implementation in the care process.

### Low engagement of advance care planning among patients who had a stroke or transient ischemic attack [^0de61d00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The goal of advance care planning (ACP) is to ensure that medical care is consistent with patients' values and preferences. ACP is a process and should be reviewed after a change in health, such as a stroke, as preferences may have changed. Yet, among stroke survivors, only 45% reported having an advance directive, and whether this was completed pre or post stroke is unknown. We sought to explore ACP engagement among patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. We conducted cross‐sectional structured telephone interviews of patients with stroke/TIA admitted to a Comprehensive Stroke Center from November 2019 to November 2020 until we reached 50 respondents. We excluded patients with stroke/TIA who had hearing, vision, cognitive, or language deficits. We queried demographics, health literacy (confident with forms by self‐report), and modified Rankin Scale score. Our primary outcome was the validated 4‐item Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey. The survey assesses 4 critical ACP elements on a 5‐point Likert scale that reflect behavior change: (1) signing official papers (durable power of attorney) naming a surrogate decision‐maker; (2) discussion of patients' wishes with surrogate decision‐maker; (3) discussion of patients' wishes with medical provider; and (4) completion of an advance directive. Responses were dichotomized as "I have already done it" versus other stages of engagement (never thought about it; thought about it, but I am not ready; thinking about it in the next 6 months; definitely planning to it in the next 30 days). For those who engaged in ACP, we asked whether this was before or after their stroke/TIA and whether they had uploaded the ACP documents (durable power of attorneyor advance directive) into their patient portal. Secondarily, we scored the 4 Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey questions as an average 5‐point Likert scale (scored 1–5). If a respondent indicated prior designation of a surrogate decision‐maker, we also attempted to enroll the surrogate. Patients with stroke/TIA and surrogates were queried about life‐prolonging treatment (LPT) preferences. Specifically, participants with stroke/TIA were asked whether they would want to receive or stop/reject all life‐prolonging treatments if they had a serious or terminal illness and were experiencing either of these hypothetical scenarios: (1) they could speak, walk, and recognize others but were in constant, severe physical pain; and (2) they were not in pain, but could not speak, walk, or recognize others. Surrogates were asked what the patient would want in these scenarios. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize study participants and describe ACP engagement. Unweighted Cohen's Kappa was used to assess agreement between patient and surrogate for LPT scenarios. The study was deemed exempt from review by the University of Michigan institutional review board. Participants gave informed consent to participate.

### Implementation of best practices-developing and optimizing regional systems of stroke care: design and methodology [^e265540a]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The AHA Guidelines recommend developing multi-tiered systems for the care of patients with acute stroke. 1 An ideal stroke system of care should ensure that all patients receive the most efficient and timely care, regardless of how they first enter or access the medical care system. Coordination among the components of a stroke system is the most challenging but most essential aspect of any system of care. The Implementation of Best Practices For Acute Stroke Care-Developing and Optimizing Regional Systems of Stroke Care (IMPROVE Stroke Care) project, is designed to implement existing guidelines and systematically improve the acute stroke system of care in the Southeastern United States. Project participation includes 9 hub hospitals, approximately 80 spoke hospitals, numerous pre-hospital agencies (911, fire, and emergency medical services) and communities within the region. The goal of the IMPROVE Stroke program is to develop a regional integrated stroke care system that identifies, classifies, and treats acute ischemic stroke patients more rapidly and effectively with reperfusion therapy. The project will identify gaps and barriers to implementation of stroke systems of care, leverage existing resources within the regions, aid in designing strategies to improve care processes, bring regional representatives together to agree on and implement best practices, protocols, and plans based on guidelines, and establish methods to monitor quality of care. The impact of implementation of stroke systems of care on mortality and long-term functional outcomes will be measured.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^9333969c]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

To support intervention fidelity, the health care providers received virtual training by the principal investigator and the research coordinator prior to initiation of the intervention to convey key intervention activities, research study procedures, and underlying theories. A standardized training manual was developed from best evidence that included key content pertaining to all aspects of the intervention. Training was adapted to the providers based on a needs assessment completed at each of the sites and included education and role-playing to enhance skills in strengths-based practice. Monthly outreach meetings were conducted to enable the principal investigators, the research coordinator, and the intervention teams to support and monitor intervention implementation and strategize to address any challenges.

The TCSI was designed to improve both the quality and experience of hospital-to-home transitions. The core components of the intervention were based on the literature (as described in the introduction), and were designed to support self-management, and included: 1) a post-discharge telephone follow-up call within 2 days of hospital discharge by the Care Coordinator, 2) up to 6 virtual visits delivered by phone or videoconference by a member of the IP team that were an average of one hour in duration (first visit occurred within 2 weeks post-discharge and then monthly thereafter), 3) monthly IP team conferences of the intervention team where the team developed an individualized patient-centred plan of care and engaged in ongoing evaluation of the plan of care at each team conference, 4) ongoing care coordination/system navigation support provided by the Care Coordinator, and 5) an online resource to support self-management and system navigation (My Stroke Recovery Journey website). The providers had access to a secure tool for communication and information sharing within the team and documenting the care that they provided (SharePoint and Electronic Medical Record). Collaborative goal setting between the IP team, older adults with stroke and their family caregivers fostered active participation of older adults in discussions, planning and shared decision-making regarding their care.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^5de0245a]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Between 20 and 30% of all strokes are recurrent strokes. An integrated care approach to stroke care can reduce the likelihood of CVD events, but should they occur, it is vital that evidence-based care pathways are in place, with equitable care available for everyone, at any timepoint. These pathways need to provide seamless, integrated, and individualized care and be delivered by a workforce that have the right knowledge, skills, and behaviours, depending on their role along the pathway. All such efforts then need to undergo rigorous evaluation and adaption in order to spend healthcare resources efficiently.

In the UK, the knowledge and skills for stroke-specific care have been clearly laid out in the Stroke-Specific Education Framework (stroke-education.org.uk), which includes 16 Elements of Care from awareness raising of stroke symptoms, through to end of life care, rehabilitation, and return to work. Whilst these have been developed for stroke specialist and stroke relevant staff, many of the knowledge, skills, and behaviours apply equally to the cardiac workforce and care pathways. The need for such standardized and integrated post stroke programmes and follow-up care after rehabilitation seems evident, but programmes are not widely available. Such programmes will help improve the quality of care, as well as help avoid unnecessary variations in patient care, and in patient outcomes as well. They also inform quality standards and allow benchmarking of services and care against recommended standards. In UK stroke care, the standards have informed the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Package (SSNAP;) which has underpinned developments in many aspects of stroke care since its inception as the National Sentinel Audit in 1997. The action plan for stroke in Europe also emphasizes the integrated stroke and secondary prevention care.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^33a1350f]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Appendix B — identifying patient rehabilitation goals — directs providers to "Assess the patient and identify the patient's rehabilitation goals," noting that goal-setting is "one of the most significant factors in tailoring rehabilitation to the patient's needs." Patients with a history of stroke "should have a holistic approach to their health care, with close attention paid to their current and desired levels of function," and "Goals should not be limited to self-care and mobility issues but should address what is required to return to active participation in one's life." Commonly reported goals include "improving mobility outdoors, improving hand function, and being able to cook." The guideline offers questions to facilitate collaborative, patient-centered goals, stating that "Asking the following questions might help the provider understand how a stroke has impacted a person's ability to function and participate in meaningful activities, providing a steppingstone for creating collaborative, patient-centered goals," with examples such as "What things are most important for you in your life?," "Who are members of your support network, and are they available or able to help you with your current needs?," "With what do you need help the most at home (e.g., bathing, dressing, toileting, eating)?," "Are you concerned about your ability to pay your living expenses?," and "Are you able to clean your house, manage your groceries, and prepare your meals?"

Patient perspective

Stroke is an unexpected, and for most people, a life-changing event, and it is important to remember that every patients' experience will be unique. The trajectory will differ between patients, and their perceptions and experiences will be influenced by the stroke sequelae, the care and treatment they receive, the ongoing support available to them, and their ability to adapt/adjust. For many patients and their family/caregivers, their main concern following a stroke is the risk of a recurrent event. Therefore, the emphasis is often on secondary stroke prevention, and lifestyle changes are necessitated; these must be individually tailored to the patient. However, for those with a severely disabling stroke, prevention of recurrence is generally a lower priority. For many patients finding the cause of their stroke is important to enable them to reduce their chances of recurrence. However, the aetiology of the stroke is often not immediately apparent and may require ongoing, and sometimes protracted, investigation to ascertain the cause; in about 30%, the cause will remain unknown, and this heightens anxiety and can significantly impair recovery.

Stroke has a significant psychological impact as well as physical side-effects. Post-stroke depression and anxiety are commonand can significantly impact patients' ability, motivation, and engagement with essential lifestyle modifications (e.g. medication adherence, exercise, smoking cessation, dietary changes, etc.); for some, the emotional impact of the stroke may only become apparent several months later. Loss of independence, greater reliance on family and friends, inability to return to work, decreases in previous social/leisure activities, disability or reduced physical functioning, cognitive impairment, communication difficulties (reading, speaking, listening), fatigue, effect on relationships, and the financial impact of stroke can all detrimentally affect the patient, impacting their physical and mental health and reducing their quality of life (and that of their family). It is also imperative to consider the impact of socioeconomic factors, such as health literacy, housing conditions, access to affordable and nutritious food, personal safety, transport, social support etc. on an individual's capacity for resilience and ability to implement lifestyle changes necessary to promote recovery and reduce recurrence.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^4646f8ad]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It is evident that the events leading to a stroke develop over many years, even decades, before the patient is admitted acutely to a stroke care facility as the stroke risk factors silently build the cardiovascular pathology which will eventually cause the stroke. These cardiovascular risk factors are chronic conditions that persist in the stroke survivor, alter recovery, and increase the risk of recurrence. Moreover, the stroke patient is usually elderly and often has associated disabilities and comorbidities that complicate the successful re-integration into the community, and is one of the most complicated medical paths that a person may have to walk through (Figure 4). Stroke is one of the most typical examples of a medical condition which extends horizontally beyond and across the boundaries of the traditional medical specialties and is best served by integrated, collaborative, inclusive, interdisciplinary teamwork.

Figure 4
The Stroke Continuum. Patient care across the Stroke Continuum: from primordial prevention (maintenance of health) to primary prevention (control of stroke risk factors), acute stroke, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention (minimization of stroke impact). Depending on the stage of the Stroke Continuum in which the stroke patient is encountered, the stroke physician may have different roles and responsibilities. For example: stroke physicians who serve at the acute stroke care setting would preferentially have strong expertise in selecting and implementing interventional procedures, offering best supportive treatment to minimize acute complications, and guiding and evaluating the diagnostic workup to plan the most effective treatments to reduce recurrence risk — typically this would involve specialty physicians of internal medicine, neurology, cardiology, critical care, intensive care and others. stroke physicians who serve at the rehabilitation setting would preferentially have strong expertise in rehabilitation and in the management of chronic complications like dysphagia, malnutrition and related metabolic derangements — typically this would involve specialty physicians of physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, internal medicine and others. Stroke physicians who serve at the outpatient clinic and focus mainly on preventing first or recurrent strokes would preferentially have strong expertise in the management of stroke risk factors — typically this would involve specialty physicians of cardiology, neurology, internal medicine, general practitioners and others. Stroke physicians who are engaged with interventional procedures in the hyperacute and acute setting (or else, stroke interventionists) would preferentially have strong expertise in endovascular procedures like interventional neurology, neuroradiology/radiology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and cardiology. Across the Stroke Continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

### Associations between the organisation of stroke services, process of care, and mortality in england: prospective cohort study [^cdc53588]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

The quality of care that patients with stroke receive is measured in the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme through the achievement of 12 process measures (key indicators in the audit's nomenclature). Patients — for example, those who are unconscious, receiving end of life care, or medically unfit (and other prespecified exclusion criteria) — may be identified in the programme as being ineligible for audit measures by the clinical team providing care for them and thus be excluded from the denominator population for the measure. In this study we evaluated process measures that would be applicable to most patients with ischaemic stroke and which described an active treatment or intervention (table 1). We therefore did not include indicators that applied to fewer than 80% of patients (on this basis we excluded thrombolysis if eligible, continence plan drawn up within 72 hours if applicable, and arrival on stroke bed within four hours of admission if out of normal hours). We also did not include one measure of data quality (known time of onset for stroke symptoms) and one relating to the quality of communication (prognosis or diagnosis discussed with relative or carer within 72 hours where applicable). Of the two similar indicators related to brain scanning, we excluded one (brain scan within one hour of admission) to avoid duplication. Four of the process measures are care bundles, where all components of the bundle need to be completed for the achievement of the process measure. To assess the relation between overall care quality and mortality we calculated a composite quality score: the cumulative number of the six process measures completed. To reduce the effect of indication bias, we calculated the score only for patients applicable for all six measures. We dichotomised the quality score (range 0–6), with the groupings determined so as to ensure as equal as possible numbers in the two groups: low, 0–4 of six process measures completed, and high, five or six process measures completed. Full details of the audit, its dataset, and definitions are available online (.

Proportion of eligible patients receiving each of measured processes of care

The study cohort included all patients aged 18 or more years with acute ischaemic stroke who were admitted between 1 April 2010 and 30 November 2011 to an English hospital participating in the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme. To reduce the risk of sampling bias from hospitals with incomplete participation in the programme we excluded data on patients from hospitals admitting fewer than 20 patients with acute ischaemic stroke in this period. We classified stroke type by the Oxford Community Stroke Project definition.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^04176170]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Primary care after stroke — Practice quality improvement and care models: Quality improvement begins when clinicians identify an aspect of care to upgrade; for example, clinicians may set a goal of improving blood pressure (BP) control for patients with hypertension, with key features including an iterative process of continuous planning, implementing change, study, testing, and redesign; an agreed-on methodology (eg, Lean, Six Sigma); empowerment of front-line workers and service users; and data to inform and monitor the process (eg, audit and feedback). Effective interventions relevant to stroke care include employment of pharmacists in a practice to improve medication adherence and achieve better control of hypertension and diabetes, and patient self-monitoring with or without self-management to improve BP control. Health services research has discovered effective poststroke interventions that often address the critical posthospital discharge transition period; a broad conclusion is that hospital-based or system-based collaborative care and case management can help patients with stroke to improve risk factor control, with effective modules including advanced practice clinicians who are part of or in close communication with primary care teams, meet personally with patients, and have prescription authority.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^bf4b0df1]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Poststroke physical rehabilitation in primary care — algorithm for screening and management specifies foundational steps and branching actions: Education about stroke (Class 1 recommendation), Advice and support for individually tailored recreational exercise program (Class 1 recommendation), and Advice to participate in balance training to reduce falls (Class 1 recommendation), followed by ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS (Class I or IIa Recommendations). If Rehabilitation potential has been achieved, proceed to Periodic reassessment; if not, Refer for therapy to address specific needs. This assessment determines the need for rehabilitation services, is initiated during admission and repeated in the office setting, and capabilities and needs for rehabilitation can change over time and across the continuum of stroke recovery. Three questions can be helpful in this assessment: (1) What could the patient do before the stroke that they cannot do now? (2) What does the patient want to be able to do? (3) Has the patient reached full potential?

### Patient-centred communication intervention study to evaluate nurse-patient interactions in complex continuing care [^6a2dfa11]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Communication impairment is a frequent consequence of stroke. Patients who cannot articulate their needs respond with frustration and agitation, resulting in poor optimization of post-stroke functions. A key component of patient-centred care is the ability of staff to communicate in a way that allows them to understand the patient's needs. We developed a patient-centred communication intervention targeting registered and unregulated nursing staff caring for complex continuing care patients with communication impairments post stroke. Research objectives include 1) examining the effects of the intervention on patients' quality of life, depression, satisfaction with care, and agitation; and (2) examining the extent to which the intervention improves staff's attitudes and knowledge in caring for patients with communication impairments. The intervention builds on a previous pilot study.

Methods/Design

A quasi-experimental repeated measures non-equivalent control group design in a complex continuing care facility is being used. Patients with a communication impairment post-stroke admitted to the facility are eligible to participate. All staff nurses are eligible. Baseline data are collected from staff and patients. Follow-up will occur at 1 and 3 months post-intervention. Subject recruitment and data collection from 60 patients and 30 staff will take approximately 36 months. The Patient-Centred Communication Intervention consists of three components: (1) development of an individualized patient communication care plan; (2) a one-day workshop focused on communication and behavioural management strategies for nursing staff; and (3) a staff support system. The intervention takes comprehensive patient assessments into account to inform the development of communication and behavioural strategies specifically tailored to each patient.

Discussion

The Patient-Centred Communication Intervention will provide staff with strategies to facilitate interactions with patients and to minimize agitation associated with considerable stress. The improvement of these interactions will lead to a reduction of agitation, which has the additional significance of increasing patients' well-being, quality of life, and satisfaction with care.

### Planning of stroke care and urgent prehospital care across Europe: results of the ESO / ESMINT / EAN / SAFE survey [^d7988c8e]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adequate planning and implementation of stroke systems of care is key to guarantee a rapid healthcare response and delivery of specific reperfusion therapies among candidates. We assessed the availability of stroke care plans in Europe, and evaluated their impact on rates of reperfusion therapies for stroke.

Patients

Based on the European Stroke Organisation (ESO), the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT), the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), and the Stroke Alliance for Europe (SAFE) survey, we analysed specific prespecified items in the questionnaire regarding availability and adequacy of stroke care plans, organised prehospital care and their potential impact on rates of delivery of reperfusion therapies for stroke at the country level.

Results

Of 44 participating European countries, 37 have stroke care plans that operate at national and/or regional levels. Most stroke care plans take responsibility for the organisation/implementation of stroke systems of care (86%), quality of care assessment (77%), and act as a liaison between emergency medical systems and stroke physicians (79%). As for stroke systems of care, the focus is mainly on prehospital and in-hospital acute stroke care (Code Stroke systems available in 37/44 countries). Preferred urgent transport is via non-medicalised ambulances (70%). Presence of stroke care plans, stroke registry data, transport of urgent stroke patients via non-medicalised ambulances, and drip-and-ship routing of acute patients showed higher reperfusion treatment rates.

Discussion

Availability of stroke care plans, still absent in some European countries, as well as some features of the stroke systems of care are associated with higher reperfusion treatment rates.

Conclusion

Stroke is not yet a priority everywhere in Europe, which is a barrier to the spread of reperfusion therapies for stroke.

The management of the acute ischemic stroke patient spans the time course from the emergency evaluation and treatment period through to the eventual discharge planning phase of stroke care. In this article we evaluate the literature and describe what have become standard treatments in the care of the stroke patient. We will review the literature that supports the use of a dedicated stroke unit for routine stroke care which has demonstrated reduced rates of morbidity and mortality. Also reviewed is the use of glycemic control in the initial setting along with data supporting the use of prophylactic treatments options in order to aide in the prevention of life threatening medical complications. In addition, lifesaving treatments will be discussed in light of new literature demonstrating reduced mortality in large hemispheric stroke patients undergoing surgical decompressive surgery. Both medical and surgical treatment options are discussed and compared.

### Impact of evidence-based stroke care on patient outcomes: a multilevel analysis of an international study [^82f47973]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These secondary analyses of a large international clinical trial have 2 major findings. First, data show that the implementation of guideline‐recommended AIS processes of care is associated with clear beneficial clinical outcome, including a dramatic halving in the risk of death within 90 days, even after accounting for a range of confounding variables. Second, overall use of defect‐free stroke care was low, and there was considerable regional variation, especially across several components, including the use of ASU care. Although the organization of services is important for delivering efficient and effective stroke care, we were unable to identify a specific hospital characteristic that was independently associated with clinical outcome; patient‐level characteristics were the main driver of clinical outcome.

Various stroke quality assessment and improvement programs exist around the world. In the United States, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors adherence to 10 quality‐of‐care measures in hospitals across 7 states through the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry, where patients who received the best quality of care have been shown to have an increased chance of long‐term survival. 8 Quality of care and process improvement have also been presented in numerous publications from the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines program. 17 Similar initiatives have been developed in Australia and the United Kingdom, 7, 18, 19 but there are few available in developing countries. 20 In keeping with our findings of the cumulative benefit on outcomes from multiple processes of care, data from the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry have shown that patients who received 3 processes of care (stroke unit care, discharged on antihypertensive agents, and discharged with a care plan) had a 70% reduced hazard of death at 180 days. 18

### How do patients pass through stroke services? Identifying stroke care pathways using national audit data [^2eeea466]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the late 1990s, when the Stroke Unit Trialists established that specialist stroke unit care improved outcomes, there has been a sea-change in stroke services through the adoption of evidence-based care. Specialist stroke units are now the default way of organizing stroke care. When first introduced, they focussed on providing specialist stroke rehabilitation and acute care was provided in general medical wards; however, the advent of acute stroke care as a clinical speciality led to a shift towards acute, and then hyper-acute stroke unit careRecently, a 'hub and spoke' model in which patients are taken to a large, central specialist unit (rather than the nearest hospital) for hyper-acute stroke before repatriation to the local stroke service for ongoing care has demonstrated greater clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and is being implemented in large metropolitan areas. Specialist stroke services after discharge from hospital, in the form of early supported discharge and community rehabilitation teams, have also proved more clinical- and cost-effective – than hospital services without postdischarge rehabilitation, and have been widely implemented: 80% of the stroke services in the United Kingdom now have access to an early supported discharge service and 75% have access to a community stroke rehabilitation service.

Although these different types of specialist stroke units/teams are effective, recommended in clinical guidelines and have been widely implemented, they each address a specific stage of stroke care. Stroke services, however, need to cover all stages of care, from admission to long-term support for 'life after stroke'. There are many ways of configuring these overarching stroke services. They may consist of any combination of hyper-acute, acute, inpatient rehabilitation, early supported discharge and/or community rehabilitation either as stand-alone or as combined units or teams. The way these overarching services are configured may affect (positively or negatively) stroke outcomes beyond that reported for an individual type of stroke unit/teams. Our aim in this article was to explore how stroke patients passed through stroke services in terms of the types of stroke units/teams they were treated by from admission to hospital to final discharge from specialist stroke services. Specifically, we wished to categorize routes to facilitate service planning and research for patients with different therapy needs, describing outcomes and costs in each category. This was the first step of work to investigate the effectiveness of different therapy provision in practice.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^57fe7593]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with stroke is often multidisciplinary, involving various specialties and healthcare professionals. Given the common shared risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease, input may also be required from the cardiovascular teams, as well as patient caregivers and next-of-kin. Ultimately, the patient is central to all this, requiring a coordinated and uniform approach to the priorities of post-stroke management, which can be consistently implemented by different multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, as part of the patient 'journey' or 'patient pathway', supported by appropriate education and tele-medicine approaches. All these aspects would ultimately aid delivery of care and improve patient (and caregiver) engagement and empowerment. Given the need to address the multidisciplinary approach to holistic or integrated care of patients with heart disease and stroke, the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke convened a Task Force, with the remit to propose a consensus on Integrated care management for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease. The present position paper summarizes the available evidence and proposes consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and simple practical approaches to assist in everyday clinical practice. A post-stroke ABC pathway is proposed, as a more holistic approach to integrated stroke care, would include three pillars of management: A: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy.B: Better functional and psychological status.C: Cardiovascular risk factors and Comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes).

Long-term post-stroke management

Emerging evidence suggests that comprehensive pragmatic care pathways with continued post-hospital involvement of the multidisciplinary stroke team could reduce the longer-term health burden of stroke. Further high-quality studies are needed to inform sustainable long-term care pathways for long-term improvement in clinical and patient-reported outcomes among stroke patients.

### Recommendations for regional stroke destination plans in rural, suburban, and urban communities from the prehospital stroke system of care consensus conference: a consensus statement from the American Academy of Neurology, American Heart Association / American stroke association, American Society of Neuroradiology, national association of EMS physicians, national association of state EMS officials, Society of Neurointerventional Surgery, and society of vascular and interventional neurology: endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society [^3837e17c]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Inpatient stroke unit destination — prioritization: When options exist, prehospital destination plans and interfacility transport policies should prioritize transport to a hospital with a dedicated stroke unit for poststroke care, and patients who receive initial care at an ASRH or basic receiving facility without a stroke unit should generally be transferred to a higher level of stroke care for admission and evaluation.

Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Data collection, reporting, and research needs to support destination planning: States should require standardized data collection and reporting with data sharing and transparency; systems should include elements from stroke detection and 911 activation through hospital discharge; clinical outcomes should be used to assess the effectiveness of the regional SSOC; because no randomized trial data exist to support a definitive recommendation on the acceptable additional time when considering triage of a patient with suspected LVO to a CSC, ongoing research is critical; during implementation, EMS systems and personnel will need time to become proficient in performance, collection, and reporting of stroke screens and severity scores, capture relevant time intervals, and assess triaged patients; data from regional SSOC implementation and new research should be reviewed with the regional SSOC advisory committee and used to modify destination plans accordingly.

### Planning after stroke survival: advance care planning in the stroke clinic [^d0074f7a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke survivors have high rates of mortality and recurrent stroke. Stroke patients are often unable to participate in decision making, highlighting the need for advance care planning in poststroke care. We sought to better understand experiences and perceptions around stroke risk andin our stroke clinic.

Methods and Results

Clinic patients completed the Planning After Stroke Survival survey assessing (1) advance directive documentation andconversations, (2) factors associated withand, (3) perceptions of stroke risk, and (4)needs. We used a physician survey and the electronic medical record to assess clinical and demographic information. We collected 219 surveys (78% response rate). Forty‐five percent reported having completed, although the correlation between patient report anddocumentation ofwas low. Most patients (73%) had discussed, and 58% desired additional conversation. Predictors of completingincluded age (≥ 65 years; odds ratio, 4.8; 95%2.3–10.1), white race (odds ratio, 3.1; 95%, 1.2–7.8), milder poststroke disability (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 1; odds ratio, 2.9; 95%, 1.3–6.4), having previously discussedwith a physician (odds ratio, 4.8; 95%, 2.0–11.7), and discussing risk of stroke recurrence (odds ratio, 2.2; 95%, 1.1–4.5).

Conclusions

Stroke survivors had lowcompletion rates and desired more conversations about stroke risk and. Completedwere inconsistently documented in the electronic medical record. These findings provide guidance to improvein our stroke clinic and may provide a model for others interested in enhancingand ultimately goal‐concordant care.

### Developing a stroke unit using the acute care for elders intervention and model of care [^dc8f5166]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

The Acute Care for Elders (ACE) model of care is a multicomponent intervention that improves outcomes for older patients hospitalized for acute medical illnesses. Likewise, stroke units improve outcomes for patients with acute stroke, yet the descriptions of their structure and approach to stroke management are heterogeneous. The purpose of this article is to describe how implementing the ACE model of care, using a continuous quality-improvement process, can serve as a foundation for a successful stroke unit aimed at improving stroke care. The ACE intervention (a prepared environment, interdisciplinary team management, patient-centered nursing care plans, early discharge planning, and review of medical care) was amplified in a community teaching hospital for stroke-specific care by creating a stroke interdisciplinary team, evidence-based stroke orders and protocols, and a redesigned environment. Administrative data show that the ACE model can be successfully adapted to create a disease-specific program for stroke patients, having the potential to improve the process of care and clinical stroke outcomes.

### How do patients pass through stroke services? Identifying stroke care pathways using national audit data [^427c27ff]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To map and describe how patients pass through stroke services.

Methods

Data from 94,905 stroke patients (July 2013-July 2015) who were still inpatients 72 hours after hospital admission were extracted from a national stroke register and were used to identify the routes patients took through hospital and community stroke services. We sought to categorize these routes through iterative consultations with clinical experts and to describe patient characteristics, therapy provision, outcomes and costs within each category.

Results

We identified 874 routes defined by the type of admitting stroke team and subsequent transfer history. We consolidated these into nine distinct routes and further summarized these into three overlapping 'pathways' that accounted for 99% of the patients. These were direct discharge (44%), community rehabilitation (47%) and inpatient transfer (19%) with 12% of the patients receiving both inpatient transfer and community rehabilitation. Patients with the mildest and most severe strokes were more likely to follow the direct discharge pathway. Those perceived to need most therapy were more likely to follow the inpatient transfer pathway. Costs were lowest and mortality was highest for patients on the direct discharge pathway. Outcomes were best for patients on the community rehabilitation pathway and costs were highest where patients underwent inpatient transfers.

Conclusion

Three overarching stroke care pathways were identified which differ according to patient characteristics, therapy needs and outcomes. This pathway mapping provides a benchmark to develop and plan clinical services, and for future research.

### Provider characteristics, clinical-work processes and their relationship to discharge summary quality for sub-acute care patients [^0625be61]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Discharge summaries play a pivotal role in the transitional care of patients discharged to sub-acute care facilities, but the best ways to facilitate document completeness/quality remain unknown.

Objective

To examine the relationship among clinical-work processes, provider characteristics, and discharge summary content to identify approaches that promote high-quality discharge documentation.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Subjects

All hip fracture and stroke patients discharged to sub-acute care facilities during 2003–2005 from a large Midwestern academic medical center (N = 489). Patients on hospice/comfort care were excluded.

Main Measures

We abstracted 32 expert-recommended components in four categories ('patient's medical course', 'functional/cognitive ability at discharge', 'future plan of care', and 'name/contact information') from the discharge summaries of sample patients. We examined predictors for the number of included components within each category using Poisson regression models. Predictors included work processes (document completion in relation to discharge day; completion time of day) and provider characteristics (training year; specialty).

Key Results

Historical components (i.e., 'patient's medical course' category) were included more often than components that directly inform the admission orders in the sub-acute care facility (i.e., 'future plan of care'). In this latter category, most summaries included a discharge medication list (99%), disposition (90%), and instructions for follow-up (91%), but less frequently included diet (68%), activity instructions (58%), therapy orders (56%), prognosis/diagnosis communication to patient/family (15%), code status (7%), and pending studies (6%). 'Future plan of care' components were more likely to be omitted if a discharge summary was created > 24 h after discharge (incident rate ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.84–0.98) or if an intern created the summary (0.90, 0.83–0.97).

Conclusion

Critical component omissions in discharge summaries were common, and were associated with delayed document creation and less experienced providers. More research is needed to understand the impact of discharge documentation quality on patient/system outcomes.

Based on a review of the evidence, members of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Stroke Group's Movement Interventions Task Force offer these 5 recommendations to help improve transitions of care for patients and their caregivers: (1) improving communication processes; (2) using transition specialists; (3) implementing a patient-centered discharge checklist; (4) using standardized outcome measures; and (5) establishing partnerships with community wellness programs. Because of changes in health care policy, there are incentives to improve transitions during stroke rehabilitation. Although transition management programs often include multidisciplinary teams, medication management, caregiver education, and follow-up care management, there is a lack of a comprehensive and standardized approach to implement transition management protocols during poststroke rehabilitation. This article uses the Transitions of Care (TOC) model to conceptualize how to facilitate a comprehensive patient-centered hand off at discharge to maximize patient functioning and health. Specifically, this article reviews current guidelines and provides an evidence summary of several commonly cited approaches (Early Supported Discharge, planned predischarge home visits, discharge checklists) to manage TOC, followed by a description of documented barriers to effective transitions. Patient-centered and standardized transition management may improve community integration, activities of daily living performance, and quality of life for stroke survivors while also decreasing hospital readmission rates during the transition from hospital to home to community.

### Building centers of excellence for the care of young adults with stroke [^a74e9fdf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Significant gaps exist in transitions of care from pediatric to adult medicine for pediatric survivors. An analysis from the National Survey of Children's health reported that only 17% of children with chronic medical conditions received guidance on transition planning. For a pediatric survivor of stroke, these gaps can have devastating consequences, particularly for children with ongoing disability who are leaving home. Ensuring a structured plan for the myriad realms in which survivors of stroke need support (eg, medication adherence, mobility, late complications after stroke) often requires lengthy lead‐in time and collaboration between pediatric and adult providers, in conjunction with the patient and caregivers, to ensure optimal care coordination and transition readiness.

We believe that centers providing optimal postacute care for young survivors of stroke are structured with the following principles:
Clinicians and clinical programs explicitly acknowledge young survivors of stroke as a unique subgroup. This acknowledgement may manifest as a clinic dedicated to young survivors, longer appointment times, young survivor‐specific support groups (local or regional), or educational materials and other resources specific to young survivors and their caregivers.
Coordinated, multidisciplinary care is essential for optimal diagnosis and prevention, as well as rehabilitation, adaptation, and survivorship. Current stroke programs for young survivors develop strong connections to other neurological, medical, surgical, and rehabilitation disciplines.
Clinicians providing care for young survivors are adept at identifying and addressing late complications after stroke to attenuate or remove these barriers from the recovery trajectory of survivors.
Clinical programs address the well‐being of young survivors, assigning priority to improving quality of life and aiding survivors in achieving their role‐ and responsibility‐related goals. Use of patient centered measures such as the Young Stroke Questionnaire may provide more age‐appropriate targets for interventions.
Clinical programs aid survivors by supporting caregivers, including with family caregiver training.
Both adult and pediatric centers take into special consideration the complex needs of pediatric stroke survivors transitioning to adulthood with a structured process to address ongoing and anticipated poststroke issues.
As young adults with stroke have high rates of premature mortality, focused efforts on identifying and addressing causes of early mortality (eg, cardioaortic disease, recurrent stroke, malignancy) must be prioritized.
Understanding that these priorities take time, clinical programs may develop methods of providing longitudinal care or developing systems of long‐term follow‐up to continue to aid young survivors as new health considerations emerge (eg, pregnancy after stroke, advancing into middle age).

### A cluster randomized trial to assess the effect of clinical pathways for patients with stroke: results of the clinical pathways for effective and appropriate care study [^46138445]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study adds evidence in favor of the notion that, compared with UC, CPs can help to provide better, comprehensive, and more specialized care to patients affected by stroke. However, additional studies are needed to further understand the cost-effectiveness of CPs and how to pass the critical point at which adherence to a pathway decreases.

### Planning after stroke survival: advance care planning in the stroke clinic [^2d94d83e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

We expect that many patients will have discussed poststroke ACP with a primary care physician or other provider before their stroke clinic visit. This is especially likely given the 5 months' median interval between initial hospitalization and follow‐up in our clinic. We did not assess the frequency of ACP discussions with a primary care or other healthcare provider before stroke clinic follow‐up. As a national quality measure, all patients should have received stroke education, including education around stroke risk, during their initial hospitalization. However, stroke patients typically present at their worst, and in‐hospital goals‐of‐care conversations are often held with surrogates, making it likely that patients would not recall previous conversations. 33 We take these factors to reinforce the importance of repeating ACP discussions on a recurring basis, including in the clinic setting. 20 It is worth noting that there are now Current Procedural Terminology billing codes available for prolonged service (eg, 99354) or for ACP (eg, 99497 or 99498), which allow for physicians to be remunerated for time spent discussing these issues with their patients.

In conclusion, stroke survivors in our outpatient stroke clinic have a high burden of unmet ACP needs. Best practices on how to optimally address the gap between the conversations patients want to have about ACP and the actual conversations occurring in the stroke clinic have not yet been elucidated. Furthermore, to be of use to clinicians in emergency settings, the results of these discussions must be readily available in the EMR. Research is needed to identify the most effective ways in which stroke physicians can address the risk and anxiety that stroke survivors face in a sensitive and timely manner and to show that such efforts will relieve anxiety, enhance goal‐concordant care, and improve quality of life for stroke survivors and their families.

### How do patients pass through stroke services? Identifying stroke care pathways using national audit data [^acae3358]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To map and describe how patients pass through stroke services.

Methods:

Data from 94,905 stroke patients (July 2013–July 2015) who were still inpatients 72 hours after hospital admission were extracted from a national stroke register and were used to identify the routes patients took through hospital and community stroke services. We sought to categorize these routes through iterative consultations with clinical experts and to describe patient characteristics, therapy provision, outcomes and costs within each category.

Results:

We identified 874 routes defined by the type of admitting stroke team and subsequent transfer history. We consolidated these into nine distinct routes and further summarized these into three overlapping 'pathways' that accounted for 99% of the patients. These were direct discharge (44%), community rehabilitation (47%) and inpatient transfer (19%) with 12% of the patients receiving both inpatient transfer and community rehabilitation. Patients with the mildest and most severe strokes were more likely to follow the direct discharge pathway. Those perceived to need most therapy were more likely to follow the inpatient transfer pathway. Costs were lowest and mortality was highest for patients on the direct discharge pathway. Outcomes were best for patients on the community rehabilitation pathway and costs were highest where patients underwent inpatient transfers.

Conclusion:

Three overarching stroke care pathways were identified which differ according to patient characteristics, therapy needs and outcomes. This pathway mapping provides a benchmark to develop and plan clinical services, and for future research.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^facf1135]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary care teams provide the majority of poststroke care. When optimally configured, these teams provide patient-centered care to prevent recurrent stroke, maximize function, prevent late complications, and optimize quality of life. Patient-centered primary care after stroke begins with establishing the foundation for poststroke management while engaging caregivers and family members in support of the patient. Screening for complications (eg, depression, cognitive impairment, and fall risk) and unmet needs is both a short-term and long-term component of poststroke care. Patients with ongoing functional impairments may benefit from referral to appropriate services. Ongoing care consists of managing risk factors such as high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, carotid stenosis, and dyslipidemia. Recommendations to reduce risk of recurrent stroke also include lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet and exercise. At the system level, primary care practices can use quality improvement strategies and available resources to enhance the delivery of evidence-based care and optimize outcomes.

### How important are working relationships for stroke self-management? A qualitative study with healthcare professionals in community stroke teams [^006b9565]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Theme 3: confusion about what self-management is

Healthcare professionals had different understandings of the term self-management. Self-management was often framed with a focus on the immediate consequences of stroke, such as physical and cognitive impairments, rather than long-term reintegration into life roles, with only one participant suggesting this approach could be problematic.

'… we're more focused on can we… within stroke, can we make you back to baseline as in no impairment or can we get you as close as we could be or, unfortunately, do we acknowledge that this is now your new baseline? And all them are very much impairment led, they're not health prevention long-term management led'.– P005.

Sub-theme 1: self-management or self-directed rehab?

Participants reflected that stroke self-management relates to patients taking responsibility for their own health and maintaining their recovery when rehabilitation ends. The tasks of self-management were described as a continuation of the tasks of rehabilitation after discharge from therapy. Participants referenced a process of 'setting up' a self-management plan that was in fact ongoing self-directed rehabilitation. As the focus remains on rehabilitation and impairments, an unbalanced alliance is created as healthcare professionals adopt a leading role in determining the tasks that they believe to be important for self-management. This approach minimises a patient's ability to recognise their own skills, resources and values, and plan for their future beyond rehabilitation.

' Obviously, I know you're planning for them in a way but they're following through what you've been doing as a team and then going solo so, yeh… ' - P001

### New evidence for stroke prevention: clinical applications [^a2a403c2]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most developed nations. There is a significant body of evidence supporting strategies that target primary and secondary stroke prevention. This evidence cannot be broadly applied to all patients, and each patient's situation and values must be considered with regard to shared evidence-based decision making. Several models can be used to apply evidence to individual patients, including formal clinical decision analysis, decision aids, or simpler tools such as the likelihood of being helped vs harmed. Various programmatic models of providing patient care in stroke prevention may also be useful; these include specialized clinics or disease-management programs, anticoagulation management services, and self-testing and management of anticoagulation by patients.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c1852ef3]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association policy statement — research and public policy priorities to improve access to stroke rehabilitation include to "Increase resources dedicated to health services research of stroke rehabilitation and establish a mechanism to ensure that the research questions addressed directly reflect the practical, day-to-day challenges faced by clinicians, families, and patients who need poststroke rehabilitation" and to "Create an open-access comprehensive surveillance system that collects ongoing data across the full spectrum of stroke type, stroke severity, demographics (eg, age, race, ethnicity, sex), health systems, hospitals, and payer sources to gain greater understanding of the use of rehabilitation and other PAC services, direct and indirect costs, and patient outcomes at the population level." The statement calls to "Conduct health services research to understand how variability in rehabilitation care is influenced by health systems, hospitals, type of insurance, and alternative payment models to optimize patient recovery. There should be no variation in access, quality of rehabilitation care, and patient outcomes across different hospitals, health systems, regions, populations, and care settings" and to "Conduct a comprehensive inventory of the stated coverage policies of all major payers/insurers in the United States to tackle the challenges faced in accessing rehabilitation care, and conduct field surveys of acute hospital discharge planners to determine the type and prevalence of barriers that prevent patients getting access to the recommended level of care, and whether the stated coverage policies of insurers are being implemented as stated." It further prioritizes to "Assess the comparative effectiveness of alternative strategies, preferably with randomized controlled trials, including formal cost-effectiveness studies where feasible" and to "Collect a comprehensive set of patient-reported outcomes measured 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year after the index stroke event for a representative sample of all stroke events" with outcomes including "survival, function, well-being, quality of life, satisfaction, return to home, return to work, return to community and social engagement, and unmet needs." Additional priorities are to "Understand and optimize the care and outcomes of patients with stroke as they transition back to home," "Expand clinical training programs for acute hospital staff, including neurologists, internists, nurses, care coordinators, acute stroke center managers, and social workers," "Research optimal communication within and between health care professionals and postacute rehabilitation settings with better incorporation of CMS outcome measures," "Explore innovative models of care targeted at the hospital system level that optimize acute stroke rehabilitation and recovery," and to "Understand and optimize emotional and mental health status as a key recovery outcome."

### Secondary prevention of stroke: using the experiences of patients and carers to inform the development of an educational resource [^bfbbb688]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who have had one stroke are at increased risk of another. Secondary prevention strategies that address medical risk factors and promote healthy lifestyles can reduce the risk. However, concordance with secondary prevention strategies is poor and there has been little research into patient and carer views.

Objectives

To explore the experiences of patients and carers of receiving secondary prevention advice and use these to inform the development of an educational resource.

Methods

A total of 38 participants (25 patients and 13 carers) took part in the study which used an action research approach. Focus groups and interviews were undertaken with patients and carers who had been discharged from hospital after stroke (between 3 and 24 months previously). Framework analysis was used to examine the data and elicit action points to develop an educational resource.

Results

Participants' main concern was their desire for early access to information. They commented on their priorities for what information or support they needed, the difficulty of absorbing complex information whilst still an in-patient and how health professionals' use of language was often a barrier to understanding. They discussed the facilitators and barriers to making lifestyle changes. The educational resource was developed to include specific advice for medical and lifestyle risk factors and an individual action plan.

Conclusion

An educational resource for secondary prevention of stroke was developed using a participatory methodology. Our findings suggest that this resource is best delivered in a one-to-one manner, but further work is needed to identify its potential utility.

Randomization and interventions

The project started at each unit with a grand round that outlined the project protocol. To facilitate project implementation, a healthcare worker experienced in CPs was assigned to each unit in the experimental group. The teams included internal-medicine physicians, neurologists, physiatrists, epidemiologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, speech therapists, hospital pharmacists, psychologists, social workers, and support staff. The teams were formed on a voluntary basis; they received 3 days of training in quality improvement and in the development of CPs. To ensure the intervention was standardized, the teams also received a package including evidence-based key interventions and indicators provided by senior investigators of the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) unit of the Regional Healthcare Agency of Marche and the University of Eastern Piedmont. The teams developed their CPs over a 6-month period (for examples of CPs, see Additional file 1, Additional file 2). All groups analyzed their care processes, reviewed best evidence, defined the appropriate goals of the pathways, and compiled the results into protocols and documentation. After development, the CPs were analyzed by the EBM unit of the Regional Healthcare Agency of Marche, and were judged consistent with current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke. After validation of the CPs, each unit team educated its staff in the use of the CP and monitored its use. This meant that the CPs used in the study were not completely identical because of organizational adaptations at some sites; however, all adhered substantially to existing Italian guidelines on the hospital treatment and rehabilitation of stroke, as described by Gensini et al. and Provinciali.

Outcomes and follow-up

The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality after stroke defined as the proportion of ischemic stroke events that were fatal within 30 days of onset. Stroke fatality was chosen as the main outcome because it is clinically relevant, objectively measured, and reliably coded. The effect of CP intervention was analyzed with respect to 7-day mortality, length of in-hospital stay, hospital re-admission rates, institutionalization rates after hospital discharge, dependency levels, and complication rates along the entire continuum of care. The quality of the care provided to the patients was assessed by monitoring the implementation of evidence-based practice. The implementation of organized care at the cluster level was also evaluated. The list of indicators has been described previously in detail.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^66b1266f]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult stroke rehabilitation — assessment of disability and rehabilitation needs recommendations state: It is recommended that all individuals with stroke be provided a formal assessment of their ADLs and IADLs, communication abilities, and functional mobility before discharge from acute care hospitalization and the findings be incorporated into the care transition and the discharge planning process. It is recommended that all individuals with stroke discharged to independent community living from postacute rehabilitation or SNFs receive ADL and IADL assessment directly related to their discharge living setting. A functional assessment by a clinician with expertise in rehabilitation is recommended for patients with an acute stroke with residual functional deficits. Determination of postacute rehabilitation needs should be based on assessments of residual neurological deficits; activity limitations; cognitive, communicative, and psychological status; swallowing ability; determination of previous functional ability and medical comorbidities; level of family/caregiver support; capacity of family/ caregiver to meet the care needs of the stroke survivor; likelihood of returning to community living; and ability to participate in rehabilitation. It is reasonable that individuals with stroke discharged from acute and postacute hospitals/ centers receive formal follow-up on their ADL and IADL status, communication abilities, and functional mobility within 30 days of discharge. The routine administration of standardized measures can be useful to document the severity of stroke and resulting disability, starting in the acute phase and progressing over the course of recovery and rehabilitation. A standardized measure of balance and gait speed (for those who can walk) may be considered for planning postacute rehabilitation care and for safety counseling with the patient and family.

### Addressing disparities in acute stroke management and prognosis [^6b1cbddc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Strategies to Improve Implementation of Stroke Care Interventions

A potential strategy for integrating these varied components is through a stroke learning health system. A learning health system is an evolution in the quality improvement process where there is routine evaluation of data collected within a health care system that then informs clinical decision‐making through interdisciplinary expertise in consultation with patients, families, and community stakeholders. It is unique in its adaptability and lack of a time‐limited focus, which is typically characteristic of quality improvement initiatives. In stroke, the scope of a learning health system could encompass prevention, acute treatment, or even a holistic approach to improve the experience and outcomes from symptom onset to the patient's return to the community. One example comes from the Implementation of Best Practices for Acute Stroke Care‐Developing and Optimizing Regional Systems of Stroke Care (IMPROVE) stroke care project, which sought to increase the use of thrombolysis and reduce door‐to‐needle times in 9 hub hospitals and their spoke sites across 4 US states. This group engaged the public, EMS, and acute stroke hospitals to create a living document version of the manual of operations that could be updated with new knowledge from published evidence or the consortium itself in concert with up‐to‐date data to evaluate program effectiveness. In another example, the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance arose from the recognition of the need to improve access to high‐quality stroke care broadly and to monitor performance in an iterative fashion to identify interventions that performed best for particular subgroups of people.

### A cluster randomized trial to assess the effect of clinical pathways for patients with stroke: results of the clinical pathways for effective and appropriate care study [^dfe66456]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways (CPs) are used to improve the outcomes of acute stroke, but their use in stroke care is questionable, because the evidence on their effectiveness is still inconclusive. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether CPs improve the outcomes and the quality of care provided to patients after acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

This was a multicentre cluster-randomized trial, in which 14 hospitals were randomized to the CP arm or to the non intervention/usual care (UC) arm. Healthcare workers in the CP arm received 3 days of training in quality improvement of CPs and in use of a standardized package including information on evidence-based key interventions and indicators. Healthcare workers in the usual-care arm followed their standard procedures. The teams in the CP arm developed their CPs over a 6-month period. The primary end point was mortality. Secondary end points were: use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, implementation of organized care, length of stay, re-admission and institutionalization rates after discharge, dependency levels, and complication rates.

Results

Compared with the patients in the UC arm, the patients in the CP arm had a significantly lower risk of mortality at 7 days (OR = 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.95) and significantly lower rates of adverse functional outcomes, expressed as the odds of not returning to pre-stroke functioning in their daily life (OR = 0.42; 95 CI 0.18 to 0.98). There was no significant effect on 30-day mortality. Compared with the UC arm, the hospital diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed more appropriately in the CP arm, and the evidence-based key interventions and organized care were more applied in the CP arm.

Conclusions

CPs can significantly improve the outcomes of patients with ischemic patients with stroke, indicating better application of evidence-based key interventions and of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This study tested a new hypothesis and provided evidence on how CPs can work.

CONCLUSION

In this systematic review on the complete care process for patients with acute IS, 48 different guideline recommendations were extracted. Agreement on applicability between experts was present for seven recommendations. These may provide a first and solid foundation when updating the care process for patients with IS. When initiating quality improvement projects, it is important to understand and target barriers that may hamper implementation. This may alter the applicability of various recommendations on which full agreement was not present.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^79c1a972]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — effects of screening on outcomes: The key question is whether screening improves outcomes, and in primary care initial RCTs found little if any benefit from screening for depression; although screening improved recognition and treatment, it did not improve depressive symptoms or outcomes. Subsequent RCTs showed that depression screening combined with a collaborative care intervention — a multiprofessional approach to patient care involving a structured patient management plan and interventions, scheduled patient follow-ups, and an enhanced interprofessional communication — improved outcomes. Collaborative care for depression can include interventions from telephone calls to encourage medication compliance to intensive follow-up including structured complex psychosocial interventions.

Table 1
Key Components for Implementation in Each Type of Service Recommended by the World Stroke Organization Roadmap for Quality Stroke Services

A stroke unit is the cornerstone of stroke care. It is a dedicated section within the stroke center where beds are explicitly allocated for stroke patients. The unit is staffed by a well‐trained multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses, and therapists. At a minimum, this team should include physiotherapists and speech therapists, but ideally, it would also encompass occupational therapists, social workers, psychologists, nutritionists, pharmacists, and other specialists. The team operates according to standardized protocols.

Stroke units are an effective strategy for managing acute stroke, facilitating the timely delivery of reperfusion therapies such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy, as well as early rehabilitation. Randomized controlled trials have shown that care in a stroke unit is associated with significantly reduced odds of poor outcomes (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69–0.87]), mortality (OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66–0.88]), and death or dependency (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.66–0.85]), compared with treatment in general wards. Observational studies have demonstrated the benefits of a Minimal Stroke Unit (without reperfusion therapy), as evidenced by the experience in Guinea. In this setting, a stroke unit was established with 3 beds and equipment to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, although it did not provide reperfusion therapy. This initiative led to significantly lower in‐hospital mortality (7% versus 22%; P < 0.0001) and a reduction in complications (4% versus 28%; P < 0.001) compared with the period before the unit's establishment. Stroke units can be categorized into acute, rehabilitation, or comprehensive types. The Acute Stroke Unit is equipped with monitored beds for acute care, typically accommodating patients up to 72 hours from the onset of the symptoms. It offers the capability to administer intravenous thrombolytic treatment. This unit may be a dedicated section within the emergency department. It can either be exclusively for stroke patients or share space with a neurology or vascular unit, handling cases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and other acute conditions. The Rehabilitation Stroke Unit is staffed with a complete rehabilitation team, commencing treatment after the patient's stabilization, usually 48 to 72 hours after stroke onset. The typical duration of a patient's stay in a rehabilitation stroke unit can vary considerably, from 8 to 70 days, with a median of 15 days, depending on several factors, such as the severity of the stroke, the patient's functional status at admission, and regional practices. A Comprehensive Stroke Unit combines acute and rehabilitation care within the same facility.

Methods

Study Population

From March 28 to July 28, 2017, all patients seen by one of our stroke physicians in the University of Washington (UW) stroke clinic, including new patients, posthospital follow‐up, and established clinic patients, were offered the opportunity to complete the Planning After Stroke Survival survey as part of a quality improvement project to assess factors related to ACP and recurrent stroke risk. This clinic is part of the comprehensive stroke center at Harborview Medical Center, which provides acute inpatient and ambulatory stroke care to patients across the Pacific Northwest. Patients are referred to this clinic for hospital follow‐up after discharge from the UW and other hospitals and by outpatient providers. Because our study enrolled all comers to our stroke clinic, we included patients with all types of stroke, transient ischemic attacks, cervical artery dissections without stroke, and stroke mimics. Because it was a quality improvement project, it was determined to be exempt from review by the UW Institutional Review Board.

### Advance care planning in adults ages 80 years and older with impaired cognition: using actual conversations to examine best practices [^aac2bccf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

If the patient could participate, care partners often filled in missing information, clarified patient responses, or helped to elicit responses from the patient when the facilitator's question did not.
Care Partner: What do we understand about advanced planning and advanced directives?
Patient: I don't know.
Care Partner: Yeah, we talked about this yesterday. It's what do you want if you have a very – like your stroke. When you had a stroke…
Patient: My daughter…
Care Partner: Yeah, I took care of it, but if you have a stroke and they say you need a feeding tube…
Patient: Oh, no, nothing like that.
Care Partner: Right. See? She knows.

Structured conversation elements involving health and serious illness experiences that sought to elicit values for medical treatment or goals for care were more difficult for older adults with dementia, which meant the care partner needed to provide more details.
ACP facilitator: I understand you've had a hospitalization in the last year, Miss [patient].
Patient: I what?
Care Partner: She wants to know what it was like being in the hospital when you were there last, when you went in for the seizure that you had.
Patient: Mm‐hmm.
Care Partner: She wants to know what it was like being in the hospital.
ACP facilitator: What was that experience like? I know it was…
Patient: It was okay.
ACP facilitator: You stayed some days? I'm sure it was pretty scary as well going in, and you had a seizure?
Care Partner: Yeah, she was there for maybe – it was probably about 4 days I think, and then she went to rehab.

### Impact of evidence-based stroke care on patient outcomes: a multilevel analysis of an international study [^2e12d6c3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability, especially in low‐resource regions. 1 Although considerable advances have been made in generating the evidence base that supports various treatments, particularly for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), their implementation is often limited by resource, organizational, and funding barriers in clinical practice. 2 For example, acute stroke unit (ASU) care is one of the most cost‐effective treatments, 3, 4, 5 but many hospitals around the world do not have such a service or only have it organized in a partial manner. 6 Improvements in the delivery of stroke care can translate into better patient outcomes, but most "real‐life" quality‐of‐care evaluations are undertaken in well‐resourced hospitals located in high‐income countries and without necessarily considering both organizational and patient variables. 7, 8 A better understanding of variations in the processes of care in relation to patient outcomes can help prioritize efforts toward improving the implementation of evidence, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 9, 10

In a previous report, we identified large variations in the organization of stroke care (ie, staffing, protocols, and discharge planning) across hospitals in different countries in establishing the network for the international, multicenter HEADPOST (Head Positioning in Acute Stroke Trial). 11 More research is needed on the impact of gaps in evidence‐based care in low‐ and middle‐income countries, where access to ASU care, let alone other therapies, is often limited. 12 We aimed to determine the association between the use of recommended evidence‐based processes of stroke care and clinical outcomes for patients with AIS who participated in HEADPOST using analyses to account for hospital and patient characteristics.

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched in June 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1975 to June 2003), EMBASE (1980 to June 2003), CINAHL (1982 to June 2003), ISI Proceedings: Science & Technology (1990 to November 2003), and HealthSTAR (1994 to May 2001). We also handsearched the Journal of Integrated Care Pathways (2001 to 2003), formerly Journal of Managed Care (1997 to 1998) and Journal of Integrated Care (1998 to 2001). Reference lists of articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies that compared care pathway care with standard medical care.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer selected studies for inclusion and the other independently checked the decisions. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies. One reviewer extracted the data and the other checked the extracted data.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials (340 patients) and 12 non-randomised studies (4081 patients) were included. There was significant statistical heterogeneity in the analysis of many of the outcomes. We found no significant difference between care pathway and control groups in terms of death or discharge destination. Patients managed with a care pathway were: (a) more dependent at discharge (P = 0.04); (b) less likely to suffer a urinary tract infection (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.79); (c) less likely to be readmitted (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.39); and (d) more likely to have neuroimaging (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.25). Evidence from randomised trials suggested that patient satisfaction and quality of life were significantly lower in the care pathway group (P = 0.02 and P < 0.005 respectively).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Use of stroke care pathways may be associated with positive and negative effects. Since most of the results have been derived from non-randomised studies, they are likely to be influenced by potential biases and confounding factors. There is currently insufficient supporting evidence to justify the routine implementation of care pathways for acute stroke management or stroke rehabilitation.

### Identifying best practices to improve evaluation and management of in-hospital stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^08429d93]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

This scientific statement describes a path to optimizing care for patients who experience an in-hospital stroke. Although these patients are in a monitored environment, their evaluation and treatment are often delayed compared with patients presenting to the emergency department, contributing to higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Reducing delays and optimizing treatment for patients with in-hospital stroke could improve outcomes. This scientific statement calls for the development of hospital systems of care and targeted quality improvement for in-hospital stroke. We propose 5 core elements to optimize in-hospital stroke care: 1. Deliver stroke training to all hospital staff, including how to activate in-hospital stroke alerts. 2. Create rapid response teams with dedicated stroke training and immediate access to neurological expertise. 3. Standardize the evaluation of patients with potential in-hospital stroke with physical assessment and imaging. 4. Address barriers to treatment potentially, including interfacility transfer to advanced stroke treatment. 5. Establish an in-hospital stroke quality oversight program delivering data-driven performance feedback and driving targeted quality improvement efforts. Additional research is needed to better understand how to reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of in-hospital stroke.

### Implementation evaluation of a complex intervention to improve timeliness of care for veterans with transient ischemic attack [^712ba65f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Protocol-guided Rapid Evaluation of Veterans Experiencing New Transient Neurologic Symptoms (PREVENT) program was designed to address systemic barriers to providing timely guideline-concordant care for patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Objective

We evaluated an implementation bundle used to promote local adaptation and adoption of a multi-component, complex quality improvement (QI) intervention to improve the quality of TIA care Bravata et al. (BMC Neurology 19:294, 2019).

Design

A stepped-wedge implementation trial with six geographically diverse sites.

Participants

The six facility QI teams were multi-disciplinary, clinical staff.

Interventions

PREVENT employed a bundle of key implementation strategies: team activation; external facilitation; and a community of practice. This strategy bundle had direct ties to four constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR): Champions, Reflecting & Evaluating, Planning, and Goals & Feedback.

Main Measures

Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the CFIR and data matrix analyses, we evaluated the degree to which implementation success and clinical improvement were associated with implementation strategies. The primary outcomes were the number of completed implementation activities, the level of team organization and > 15 points improvement in the Without Fail Rate (WFR) over 1 year.

Key Results

Facility QI teams actively engaged in the implementation strategies with high utilization. Facilities with the greatest implementation success were those with central champions whose teams engaged in planning and goal setting, and regularly reflected upon their quality data and evaluated their progress against their QI plan. The strong presence of effective champions acted as a pre-condition for the strong presence of Reflecting & Evaluating, Goals & Feedback, and Planning (rather than the other way around), helping to explain how champions at the +2 level influenced ongoing implementation.

Conclusions

The CFIR-guided bundle of implementation strategies facilitated the local implementation of the PREVENT QI program and was associated with clinical improvement in the national VA healthcare system.

Trial Registration

clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02769338.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^63817482]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and applicability — adult acute arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) — are described, noting that "These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke" and "They will not be applicable to all patients," and that "Local resources and expertise, specific clinical circumstances and patient preferences, and evidence published since the issuance of these guidelines are some of the additional factors that should be considered when making individual patient care decisions"; the text also states that "In many instances, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on the treatment of AIS" and that "A focused update addressing data from additional relevant recent RCTs is in process."

### Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations rehabilitation, recovery, and community participation following stroke, part three: optimizing activity and community participation following stroke, 7th edition update, 2025 [^2defbc77]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 7th edition update of the Rehabilitation, Recovery and Community Participation module is presented in three parts. Part Three of the series reflects the current research evidence focused on person-centered care, optimizing an individual's return to their community and engaging in active and meaningful participation. Emphasis is placed on regular healthcare follow-up, maximizing secondary prevention strategies, assessment, diagnosis, and management of mood disorders and cognitive status, sleep health, and post-stroke fatigue. Personal issues that are important and meaningful to individuals with stroke are addressed, including returning to driving, vocational roles, relationships, sexuality, life roles, leisure, social participation, advance care planning, and palliative care. This module highlights the need for coordinated and seamless systems of care that extend beyond the first few months after stroke, building on progress achieved during the initial recovery, to support seamless longer-term recovery. The main goal of these recommendations is to help individuals with stroke achieve as much independence as possible in meaningful life roles and leisure activities. Successful planning across transitions requires integrated and coordinated people-centered efforts by all stroke team members and the broader community. Active engagement of the individual and family at all stages of planning and goal setting is essential.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^6772aba0]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of patients with stroke is often multidisciplinary requiring input from stroke specialists (doctors and nurses) as well as from internal medicine, neurology, radiology, emergency medicine, primary care, and rehabilitation team (including physiotherapist, speech, and occupational therapists). Given the common shared risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease, input may also be required from a cardiologist, vascular interventionist, vascular surgeon, and neurosurgeon, as well as nurses, patient caregivers, and next-of-kin. Ultimately, the patient is central to all this, requiring a coordinated and uniform approach to the priorities of post-stroke management, which can be consistently implemented by different multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, as part of the patient 'journey' or 'patient pathway,' supported by appropriate education and tele-medicine approaches. All these aspects would ultimately aid delivery of care and improve patient (and caregiver) engagement and empowerment.

Given the need to address the multidisciplinary approach to holistic or integrated care of patients with heart disease and stroke, the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke convened a Task Force, with the remit to review the published evidence and to propose a consensus on Integrated care management for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease. The present position paper summarizes the available evidence and proposes consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and simple practical approaches to assist in everyday clinical practice. Nevertheless, the ultimate judgment regarding care of each individual patient must be made by the healthcare providers and the patient and their family together, considering all the distinct circumstances presented by that patient.

Literature searches were conducted in the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry). Searches focused on English-language sources and studies in human subjects. Articles related to animal experimentation were only cited when the information was important to understanding pathophysiological concepts pertinent to patient management and comparable data were not available from human studies. Additional information was requested from the authors where necessary.

### Recommendations for regional stroke destination plans in rural, suburban, and urban communities from the prehospital stroke system of care consensus conference: a consensus statement from the American Academy of Neurology, American Heart Association / American stroke association, American Society of Neuroradiology, national association of EMS physicians, national association of state EMS officials, Society of Neurointerventional Surgery, and society of vascular and interventional neurology: endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society [^8c6c61e1]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Primary stroke center (PSC) and thrombectomy-capable stroke center (TSC) definitions — PSCs are typically small- to midsized community hospitals with dedicated inpatient stroke units that care for the majority of stroke patients with typical ischemic strokes who do not require EVT, neurosurgical interventions, or neurocritical care; PSCs that perform EVT are not currently required to collect and report metrics on these procedures. TSCs meet all criteria for PSCs, also provide EVT, and must meet the same resource requirements, data collection, and reporting for EVT as CSCs; most newly certified TSCs have appeared in communities with existing access to a CSC, posing a challenge to EMS providers and regulators regarding whether to include TSCs in local destination plans.

### Veterans affairs / department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of adult stroke rehabilitation care: executive summary [^364c4086]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A panel of experts developed stroke rehabilitation guidelines for the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense Medical Systems.

Methods

Starting from previously established guidelines, the panel evaluated published literature through 2002, using criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Recommendations were based on evidence from randomized clinical trials, uncontrolled studies, or consensus expert opinion if definitive data were lacking.

Results

Recommendations with Level I evidence include the delivery of poststroke care in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation setting or stroke unit, early patient assessment via the NIH Stroke Scale, early initiation of rehabilitation therapies, swallow screening testing for dysphagia, an active secondary stroke prevention program, and proactive prevention of venous thrombi. Standardized assessment tools should be used to develop a comprehensive treatment plan appropriate to each patient's deficits and needs. Medical therapy for depression or emotional lability is strongly recommended. A speech and language pathologist should evaluate communication and related cognitive disorders and provide treatment when indicated. The patient, caregiver, and family are essential members of the rehabilitation team and should be involved in all phases of the rehabilitation process. These recommendations are available in their entirety at http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/9/e100. Evidence tables for each of the recommendations are also in the full document.

Conclusions

These recommendations should be equally applicable to stroke patients receiving rehabilitation in all medical system settings and are not based on clinical problems or resources unique to the Federal Medical System.

### Recommendations for regional stroke destination plans in rural, suburban, and urban communities from the prehospital stroke system of care consensus conference: a consensus statement from the American Academy of Neurology, American Heart Association / American stroke association, American Society of Neuroradiology, national association of EMS physicians, national association of state EMS officials, Society of Neurointerventional Surgery, and society of vascular and interventional neurology: endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society [^e46566ca]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Stroke systems of care — CSC capacity, TSC certification, and EVT access: It is estimated that roughly 250 US hospitals will be able to achieve CSC certification under current standards, and the need for access to EVT outstrips this CSC supply substantially; rather than lowering CSC standards, a TSC standard is developed and implemented that provides all the capacity of a PSC plus the additional elements needed for EVT. The JC and AHA/ASA established a certification process for TSC in 2018 to encourage high-performing PSCs that offered EVT but did not meet all the criteria for CSC certification, and the additional TSC requirements must be met on top of the base PSC certification requirements and include the additional standards, data elements, and measures for performing EVT required for CSC but without the CSC requirements related to the care of patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Given these limitations, it is critical that communities without ready access to a CSC be provided with alternative methods to rapidly and reliably access high-quality EVT, and with the efficacy of EVT now proven up to 24 hours since last known well in imaging selected patients and the introduction of TSC, it has become necessary to provide more nuanced guidance to EMS agencies and public health authorities to create feasible, practical, reliable, and sustainable destination plans for prehospital triage of suspected stroke cases.
