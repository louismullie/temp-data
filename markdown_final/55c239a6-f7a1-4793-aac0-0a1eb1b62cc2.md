## Question

Which medication-related errors are frequently made by novice psychiatrists?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication-related errors are frequently made by novice psychiatrists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and which high-quality sources support each error domain. Then, I should categorize the error types and extract concrete, document-backed exemplars. Next, I will appraise clinical risk to prioritize the most dangerous pitfalls. After that, I should synthesize novice-specific vulnerabilities and propose targeted mitigation strategies. Finally, I will sanity-check the conclusions and cite appropriately throughout to maintain clinical rigor.

> Let me first confirm the scope and source base to avoid overreaching; I will rely primarily on FDA labeling for drug-specific safety and dosing, national and specialty guidelines for practice standards, and systems-safety literature for process failures, while using the "pitfalls" series to contextualize novice behaviors; this means key anchors will include FDA communications on iloperidone, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, lamotrigine, and naltrexone, APA delirium guidance, EASL Wilson's disease guidance, and BMJ/Cochrane analyses on transitions and adverse event reporting, supplemented, with caution, by lower-credibility "pitfalls" papers for pattern recognition of novice errors.

> I will now organize the error landscape; hold on, I should verify that the categories are mutually informative but nonredundant, so I'll group them as dosing/titration errors, monitoring/follow-up failures, communication/counseling deficiencies, knowledge/decision-making errors, and system/process errors, ensuring each category is illustrated by at least one high-credibility citation and one novice-relevant pattern from the pitfalls literature to maintain both validity and pedagogic utility.

> For dosing and titration errors, let me think about two opposite mistakes and one procedural trap: novices may underdose due to fear of side effects or overshoot beyond recommended maxima when anxious about nonresponse, and they may also titrate too fast for drugs requiring slow schedules; for example, iloperidone requires slow BID titration with daily increases not exceeding 2 mg BID to mitigate orthostatic hypotension, with an upper limit of 24 mg/day, while antipsychotic abrupt cessation risks withdrawal dyskinesia and behavioral deterioration in youth; similarly, stopping antidepressants abruptly is unsafe and should be avoided, which novices sometimes forget under discharge pressure [^115ff72k] [^115HqrYc] [^112qhqHR].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up; wait, let me verify duration-of-treatment assessments and adverse event surveillance in exemplar conditions: with tics, premature judgments within the natural waxing/waning cycle can misclassify efficacy, so a 2–3 month evaluation window is prudent, and for antipsychotics, an explicit "exit strategy" prevents unnecessary long-term exposure; concurrently, high-risk monitoring includes orthostatic hypotension with iloperidone and respiratory depression when benzodiazepines are combined with opioids, both of which demand proactive surveillance and dose limitation [^112GBnSd] [^112XdJDs] [^115ff72k] [^113xEcDe].

> Communication and counseling deficiencies often drive harm at the bedside; I should double-check that the FDA medication guide requirement and interaction counseling are emphasized: clinicians must provide and discuss antidepressant medication guides and suicidality warnings, counsel on CNS depressant interactions with clobazam and other benzodiazepines, and highlight alcohol and hypotension cautions for apomorphine, as these conversations reduce preventable adverse events and promote shared vigilance during dose changes [^114XYKD9] [^1126MENQ] [^112BtKye] [^115thFVW].

> Let me consider knowledge and decision-making errors; hold on, I should verify each exemplar: diagnostic overshadowing and functional presentations can lead to misguided dose escalation in tics when the picture is actually functional and nonresponsive to typical agents; LASA errors with lamotrigine are well-documented, including formulation confusion, necessitating clear labeling and patient tablet verification; guidelines advise against antipsychotics or melatonin/ramelteon for delirium prophylaxis, a frequent misconception; and in Wilson's disease, avoid most neuroleptics except quetiapine or clozapine to prevent neurological worsening; finally, transitions invite omission/duplication and wrong-dose errors, stressing reconciliation rigor [^112GBnSd] [^111jn3e2] [^112Fv2YG] [^116Bt2jY] [^113Z3nxD] [^113bDckt] [^113X7tTj].

> For system and process errors, I need to ensure we distinguish administration from prescribing failures; community mental health incident analyses show administering and dispensing errors with depot antipsychotics linked to attentional lapses and equipment issues, while digital maturity with BCMA reduces administration errors when implemented with workflow change and training; underreporting of ADEs remains a barrier to learning, and structured interventions can increase reporting volume and timeliness, enabling system feedback [^112g8ogs] [^113X7tTj] [^115T7QAh].

> Now, I should prioritize by clinical impact rather than frequency alone; but wait, I must cross-check the most dangerous scenarios: benzodiazepine–opioid co-prescribing carries risks of profound sedation and fatal respiratory depression; abrupt discontinuation of antidepressants or antipsychotics can precipitate severe withdrawal or behavioral decompensation; LASA/formulation confusion with lamotrigine risks serious harm, especially when dosing is misapplied; exceeding antipsychotic maximums adds side effects without benefit; and inadequate opioid-free intervals before naltrexone can precipitate withdrawal despite negative screens, warranting naloxone challenge and careful history [^113xEcDe] [^112qhqHR] [^112Fv2YG] [^115HqrYc].

> I will now examine why novices are vulnerable; let me verify that the drivers map to training gaps: limited pattern recognition leads to misreading functional tics and misattribution, uncertainty promotes subtherapeutic dosing, counterphobic escalation drives supra-max dosing under pressure, knowledge gaps miss rare but lethal interactions like benzo–opioid combinations, time pressure degrades counseling on med guides and risks, and unfamiliarity with transitions undermines reconciliation, compounding errors across settings [^112GBnSd] [^115HqrYc] [^113xEcDe] [^114XYKD9] [^113X7tTj] [^114MRzta].

> Next, I should review mitigation strategies that are concrete and teachable; let me think through a practical bundle: use dosing guardrails and checklists to respect labeled maxima and mandated titration schedules such as iloperidone's, build CDS alerts and clinic policies to flag benzo–opioid co-prescribing, standardize provision and discussion of antidepressant medication guides and interactions, embed an a priori antipsychotic "exit strategy" and deprescribing prompts, require LASA and formulation verification for lamotrigine at prescribing and dispensing with patient tablet checks, strengthen transition reconciliation workflows with cross-setting information transfer, expand BCMA and team training to reduce administration errors, and implement structured ADE reporting campaigns to close the loop [^115ff72k] [^113xEcDe] [^114XYKD9] [^112XdJDs] [^111jn3e2] [^113X7tTj] [^112s9kr6] [^115T7QAh] [^113cKG5T].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially assumed melatonin might be a benign delirium prevention option based on common practice, but hold on, I should verify guideline direction; the APA advises against antipsychotics for delirium prevention and also recommends avoiding melatonin or ramelteon prophylaxis, so I need to correct that assumption and emphasize nonpharmacologic prevention strategies instead of routine pharmacologic prophylaxis in at-risk populations [^116Bt2jY] [^113Z3nxD].

> Let me reconsider whether there are additional drug-specific safety pearls novices miss; I should confirm that counseling on orthostatic risks and slow positional changes is explicit for agents like iloperidone and apomorphine, that fluoxetine and other antidepressant interaction checks are routine, and that clinicians educate patients not to start or stop medications without discussion to prevent withdrawal or serotonin syndrome risk cascades at transitions [^115ff72k] [^115thFVW].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable: novice psychiatrists most commonly err in dosing/titration, monitoring/adverse event follow-up, communication/counseling, diagnostic and selection judgement, and system processes at transitions and administration; the highest-risk patterns include benzodiazepine–opioid co-prescribing, abrupt discontinuations of psychotropics, LASA/formulation confusion with lamotrigine, exceeding antipsychotic maximums or violating required titration schedules, and precipitated withdrawal from premature naltrexone initiation; targeted guardrails, counseling standardization, reconciliation rigor, digital administration safety, and robust reporting can meaningfully reduce harm if embedded into training and systems [^113xEcDe] [^112qhqHR] [^111jn3e2] [^115ff72k] [^1143Uras] [^112s9kr6] [^115T7QAh] [^113X7tTj].

New psychiatrists commonly make medication mistakes such as **inadequate medication reconciliation** at transitions of care [^113X7tTj], leading to omissions, duplications, or dosing errors. They also **fail to monitor for adverse effects** like metabolic syndrome with antipsychotics or serotonin syndrome with antidepressants [^notfound], and may overlook drug interactions (e.g. lamotrigine with oral contraceptives) [^111jn3e2]. Other frequent errors include **prescribing without clear indications**, using antipsychotics for delirium prevention [^116Bt2jY] or inappropriate benzodiazepine use [^113xEcDe] [^114qCBPa]; **incorrect dosing or titration**, such as rapid titration of iloperidone [^115ff72k] or not adjusting for renal/hepatic impairment [^1143Uras]; and **poor patient education**, including not counseling on adherence, side effects, or when to seek help [^114XYKD9]. These errors can be reduced by thorough reconciliation, guideline adherence, careful monitoring, and clear patient communication [^112s9kr6].

---

## Inadequate medication reconciliation

With inadequate medication reconciliation, **omissions and duplications** may occur during transitions of care, leading to dosing errors [^113X7tTj]. Incorrect dosing can also arise from **confusion between different formulations or concentrations**, potentially causing overdose or therapeutic failure [^112Fv2YG].

---

## Failure to monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Inadequate monitoring for metabolic side effects (weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) with antipsychotics is common.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Failure to recognize and monitor for serotonin syndrome when combining serotonergic medications [^112exWgS].

- **Drug interactions**: Overlooking significant drug interactions, such as lamotrigine with oral contraceptives, leading to reduced efficacy or increased toxicity [^111jn3e2].

---

## Prescribing without clear indications or guidelines

Prescribing without clear indications or guideline support persists — for example, using **antipsychotics for delirium prevention** despite recommendations against their use [^116Bt2jY] — and **benzodiazepines** may be used inappropriately, increasing risks of dependence and withdrawal [^114qCBPa].

---

## Incorrect dosing and titration

Incorrect dosing and titration include **rapid titration** of medications like iloperidone without adhering to recommended schedules, which can increase adverse effects [^115ff72k], and failure to adjust doses for **renal or hepatic impairment**, leading to toxicity or subtherapeutic effects [^1143Uras].

---

## Poor patient education and communication

Poor patient education and communication include inadequate counseling on **medication adherence**, side effects, and when to seek medical attention [^114XYKD9], and **failure to provide or review medication guides**, which can cause misunderstandings and non-adherence [^112qhqHR].

---

## Strategies to prevent medication errors

- **Thorough medication reconciliation**: Conduct comprehensive medication reconciliation at every transition of care [^113X7tTj].

- **Adherence to guidelines**: Follow evidence-based guidelines and dosing recommendations [^116Bt2jY] [^113cKG5T].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions regularly [^115T7QAh].

- **Clear patient communication**: Provide clear patient education and counseling [^114XYKD9] [^1126MENQ].

- **Use of checklists**: Utilize checklists and structured clinical interviews to reduce diagnostic and prescribing errors [^116UQ4HV].

### Iloperidone [^115ff72k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Iloperidone tablets must be titrated slowly from a low starting dose to avoid orthostatic hypotension due to their alpha-adrenergic blocking properties. The recommended starting dose for iloperidone tablets is 1 mg orally twice daily. Dose increases to reach the target range of 6 mg to 12 mg twice daily (12 mg/day to 24 mg/day) may be made, with daily dosage adjustments not to exceed 2 mg twice daily (4 mg/day). The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg twice daily (24 mg/day). Iloperidone doses above 24 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials.

Efficacy was demonstrated with iloperidone tablets in a dose range of 6 mg to 12 mg twice daily. Prescribers should be mindful that patients need to be titrated to an effective dose of iloperidone tablets. Control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require similar titration. Prescribers should also be aware that some adverse effects associated with iloperidone tablet use are dose-related.

Iloperidone tablets can be administered without regard to meals.

### Pamelor [^114XYKD9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with nortriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient medication guide titled "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for nortriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the medication guide and assist them in understanding its content. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the medication guide and obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the medication guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking nortriptyline hydrochloride.

### Estimating the impact on patient safety of enabling the digital transfer of patients' prescription information in the English NHS [^113X7tTj]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

A medication error may be defined as "Any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer". The outcomes used in this study are medication errors occurring at transitions of care that involve the transfer of prescription information, referred to as transition medication errors. This excludes intentional medication changes during the medication reconciliation process. Types of transition medication errors include omissions, extra medicines, duplicated medicines, wrong dose, wrong frequency, wrong timing, wrong formulation, and acute medicines prescribed for chronic use.

There are multiple transitions that can involve information transfer. In this study, we focus on four information transfer settings:

- **Primary care to secondary care**: Hospital admission.
- **Secondary care to primary care**: Hospital discharge.
- **Intrahospital transition**: Transfer of information from one electronic prescribing system to another, including both inpatient and outpatient care.
- **Interhospital transition**.

Transitions excluded were:

- Ambulance/paramedic care.
- When patients change primary care practice.
- Mental health and other specialist services such as sexual health.
- Private hospitals (separate governance structures).
- Devolved nations (Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
- Hospital prescribing to dispensing.
- Outpatient/emergency care to community pharmacy.

Harm caused by medication is referred to as an adverse drug event (ADE).

### Sympazan [^113xEcDe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve the concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required, and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including Sympazan, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Sympazan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dependence and withdrawal reactions**: The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Sympazan, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Sympazan after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Sympazan or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions].

### Lamictal [^111jn3e2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential medication errors**: Medication errors involving Lamictal have occurred. In particular, the names Lamictal or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of Lamictal. To reduce the potential of medication errors, it is important to write and say Lamictal clearly. Depictions of the Lamictal tablets, tablets for oral suspension, and orally disintegrating tablets can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product. These depictions highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug, which may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are Lamictal, as well as the correct formulation of Lamictal, each time they fill their prescription.

- **Concomitant use with estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptives**: Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking Lamictal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels may occur.

### Ropinirole [^116rD4xu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 24% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets, with an incidence at least 2% greater than placebo, of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation, were nausea and dizziness.

- **Treatment-emergent adverse reactions**: Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e. without L-dopa).

		- **Note a**: Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

		- **Note b**: Asthenic condition (i.e. asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise).

### Apokyn [^115thFVW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Avoid using APOKYN with alcohol, as it can increase the risk of developing serious side effects. Refrain from taking medicines that induce sleepiness while using APOKYN. Do not drive, operate machinery, or engage in dangerous activities until you know how APOKYN affects you. To prevent dizziness or fainting, avoid changing your body position too quickly, and rise slowly from sitting or lying positions, as APOKYN can lower blood pressure.

- **Possible side effects of APOKYN**:
	- APOKYN may cause serious side effects. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any of the following:

	- **Allergic reaction**: Symptoms may include hives, itching, rash, swelling (such as eyes or tongue), trouble breathing, and/or swallowing after injecting APOKYN.

	- **Blood clots**: Injecting APOKYN into a vein (intravenously) can cause blood clots. Do not inject APOKYN into your vein.

	- **Nausea and vomiting**: Severe nausea and vomiting can occur with APOKYN. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medication to help reduce these symptoms. Follow their instructions on when and how to take this medicine.

	- **Sleepiness or falling asleep during the day**: Some people treated with APOKYN may become sleepy or fall asleep without warning during everyday activities like talking, eating, or driving.

	- **Dizziness**: APOKYN can lower blood pressure, leading to dizziness. This can occur when APOKYN treatment is initiated or when the dosage is adjusted.

### Canadian clinical guidelines on social isolation and loneliness in older adults [^1128mfdV]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health (CCSMH) guidelines recommend considering nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly social prescribing, to manage or alleviate social isolation and loneliness in older adults. This involves connecting patients with suitable organizations, programs, or community resources that provide opportunities for social interaction and self-care, thereby addressing the social determinants of health.

### Patient safety incidents within adult community-based mental health services in England: A mixed-methods examination of reported incidents, contributory factors, and proposed solutions [^112g8ogs]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Medication PSIs comprised 17.1% of 'No harm' reports, among which administering errors (3.8%), dispensing errors (3.4%), and patient unintentional overdoses (3.1%) were modal incident types (see Table 3). First-generation depot antipsychotics were implicated in multiple medication administering errors. Active failures, including staff attentional lapses and mistakes, were prominent contributory factors to medication-related incidents. Service user factors were also reported, such as taking medications twice by accident or concealing illegal medication supplies. Equipment and supply design issues involving similar packaging for different medications, or equipment malfunction, were also described:

'Most of the depot was given before plunger failed and became stuck, so a small amount was unable to be administered'.
Proposed solutions included calls for improved information sharing between primary and secondary care services and optimizing within-team communication using a structured clinical handover format. Service user-directed measures (e.g. medication counseling) and staff training and supervision were among the further solutions clinicians recommended (see Table 5).

### Pamelor [^1126MENQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Read the Medication Guide that comes with your or your family member's antidepressant medicine. Talk to your or your family member's healthcare provider about:

- **All risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines**: Discuss any potential side effects and weigh them against the benefits of treatment.

- **All treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illness**: Explore both medication and non-medication options with your healthcare provider.

- **Important information on antidepressant medicines, depression, serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions**: Antidepressant medicines may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are significant causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Individuals who have or have a family history of bipolar disorder (also known as manic-depressive illness) or previous suicidal thoughts or actions may be at particularly high risk.

- **Preventing suicidal thoughts and actions**: Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when starting an antidepressant medicine or when the dose is changed. Report any new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings to the healthcare provider immediately. Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^113LN1rT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As highlighted in a recent position paper, there are many unmet needs but also opportunities, alongside possible risks to consider, regarding the pharmacological treatment of mental health conditions in children and adolescents. Addressing the pitfalls in clinical practice with the psychopharmacological treatment of children and adolescents is key to maximizing the benefits of psychopharmacotherapy. While we have endeavored here to rely on available evidence and integrate it with our own clinical experience, we look forward to additional high-level empirical evidence which will inform future clinical practice and precision medicine approaches in the field.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^114soCyi]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

To achieve optimal outcomes for patients living with BP-I, it is critical to involve all stakeholders who are part of the patient journey, such as healthcare providers (HCPs), patients, and their supporters, in an early shared decision-making process (Figure 2). Early disease management represents an excellent opportunity to begin this process and pivot away from traditional clinical practices. Consistent accessibility to psychiatrists varies greatly worldwide, as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the need for treatments that decrease dependence on healthcare systems and provide the stability that a longer-acting antipsychotic may offer.

- **Relationships between stakeholders**: The figure outlines the relationships between stakeholders, including healthcare providers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

More data are required to assess the potential impact of long-acting injectables (LAIs) on BP-I and to facilitate widespread acceptance. Clinical and database studies could help bridge existing knowledge gaps and provide healthcare providers and clinics with firsthand experience from clinicians who prescribed LAIs earlier in the course of the illness. Although naturalistic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be complex to organize and complete, they are invaluable because they do not require blinding and better reflect real clinical practice while still being more controlled than real-world studies. For instance, trials to compare LAIs with lithium (the "gold standard"), especially regarding the dangers of lithium discontinuation, are highly desirable.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^114gHQkz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions we have been asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them in child and adolescent psychopharmacology, focusing on autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy, and psychosis. We have grouped the pitfalls by the disorder to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls related to the treatment of other disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder) are addressed in a separate paper (Part I).

### Groundbreaking research from NIDA addressing the challenges of the opioid epidemic [^117CrbJu]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Low credibility.

Dr. Nora D. Volkow is the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health. NIDA stands as the world's largest funder of scientific research addressing the health aspects of drug use and addiction.

Dr. Volkow's work has been pivotal in establishing that drug addiction is a brain disorder. As a research psychiatrist, she pioneered the application of brain imaging to study how substance use alters brain functions. Her studies have documented how changes in the dopamine system impact the functions of brain regions involved with reward and self-control in addiction. She has also significantly contributed to the neurobiology of obesity, ADHD, and aging.

Dr. Volkow was born in Mexico and earned her medical degree from the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, where she received the Robins Award for best medical student of her generation. Her psychiatry residency was at New York University, where she earned a Laughlin Fellowship from The American College of Psychiatrists as one of 10 outstanding psychiatric residents in the United States.

Much of her professional career was spent at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, where she held several leadership positions, including Director of Nuclear Medicine, Chairman of the Medical Department, and Associate Laboratory Director for Life Sciences. Dr. Volkow was also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Associate Dean of the Medical School at The State University of New York at Stony Brook.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^112CDpHM]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The literature shows that rural residents experience more serious technological challenges than urban residents, partly due to the distribution of medical care resources in rural and urban areas. This disparity has been a critical area of research, highlighting significant differences in access to and use of medical resources between rural and urban residents in China. For example, urban residents have greater access to high-quality medical care resources because most high-ranking hospitals are in urban areas. Compared with urban residents, rural residents must spend relatively more time and money to access similar medical resources and benefit from modern information technology, such as making appointments or obtaining medical test results online. Rural older adults benefit the least from these changes. Moreover, compared with rural residents, urban residents have more support in using modern information technology related to medical resources, like volunteer assistance, free community-organized information technology training, and home-help services.

We thus propose the second hypothesis regarding the moderating role of the rural–urban variable. The moderating effect suggests that the magnitude and/or direction of the impact of technological challenges on health conditions is affected by whether residents live in urban or rural areas.

The rural–urban factor plays a moderating role in the association between technological challenges and health conditions. Contrastingly, the association between technological challenges and health conditions remains to be fully explored.

### EASL-ern clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^113bDckt]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to the management of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend offering psychotropic medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and anxiolytics, and/or psychotherapy for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Avoid using neuroleptics (except for quetiapine or clozapine), as they can worsen neurological symptoms.

### Difficult to treat depression: Focus on approach, algorithms, and access [^113yRHCs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

The pandemic refocused interest on the burden of depression across the lifespan; the increased efforts to prevent and treat depression are now a priority of health care systems, insurers, patient advocates, digital therapeutic engineers, telemedicine platforms, and community health agencies. However, the challenges of treating depression to remission in adult patients who do not respond to first, second, or third levels of oral pharmacotherapy remain. The increased prevalence of these conditions is at odds with the shrinking psychiatric workforce.

Since addressing difficult to treat depression is situated in a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson Department of Psychiatry organized and hosted the Southwest Forum on Difficult to Treat Depression: Focus on Approach, Algorithms, and Access in July 2024. The Forum convened 11 internationally renowned experts in the science and treatment of depression, in particular difficult to treat depression, for a day of teaching and discussion. Based on their expertise, participants were asked to address one of the following three themes:

- **Novel mechanism approaches for difficult to treat depression**
- **What do I do next?**: Evidence-informed algorithms to get patients better faster.
- **Access**: Providing comprehensive depression care across the spectrum of clinical severity.

### Pamelor [^112qhqHR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first consulting a healthcare provider, as stopping abruptly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is crucial to discuss all the risks of treating depression, as well as the implications of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should consider all treatment options with the healthcare provider, not only the use of antidepressants.

- **Side effects**: Antidepressant medicines have various side effects. Discuss these with the healthcare provider related to the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.

- **Interactions**: Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medications. Be aware of all medicines you or your family member takes, and keep a list to show your healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first consulting your healthcare provider.

Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for pediatric use. Consult your child's healthcare provider for more information.

For medical advice about side effects, contact your doctor. Side effects can be reported to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

This medication guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

### Barcode medication administration system use and safety implications: A data-driven longitudinal study supported by clinical observation [^112s9kr6]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Medication administration errors are the most common adverse events in healthcare. An estimated 237 million medication errors occur every year in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, of which 66 million are clinically significant, with an increased risk of patient harm, including adverse drug-related hospital admissions, approximately 700 deaths per year due to avoidable medication errors, and an estimated annual financial cost of £98.5 million.

Digital maturity within the healthcare setting is seen as essential for increased quality and safety, as it supports the efficient and reliable flow of data between systems and makes data readily available for tracking patient outcomes, including those related to safety. Digital maturity is commonly taken to mean the implementation and use of sophisticated digital systems, typically including the integration of barcode medication administration (BCMA) systems, normally in conjunction with computerized physician order entry, electronic medication administration records, decision support systems, and all patient records managed digitally. While many NHS trusts aspire to a high level of digital maturity, in practice, it is difficult to achieve because alongside technology implementation, it also requires changes in working practices and upskilling staff to realize the benefits of greater digitization.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^116GHZZc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Similar treatment guidelines published at the time of writing are either outdated or offer guidance on a single co-occurring condition, but do not serve as comprehensive references across multiple symptom domains. They may present which drugs can be used in ASD without delving into the nuanced decision-making process essential for matching a drug to the unique needs of individual patients, or they may not specifically discuss the ASD landscape and healthcare system in the U.S. In contrast, we aim to provide a prescribing framework that is current, relevant across common symptom domains, and appropriately nuanced and practical for general practitioners in the U.S. who may be providing care to patients with ASD.

We propose pharmacological treatment guidelines for co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD, based on the clinical expertise of providers from the Lurie Center for Autism and key literature. The focus is on five common co-occurring conditions in ASD: sleep disturbances, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and irritability. Key clinical trials and investigative case studies will be discussed for each indication, and pharmacological treatment pathways will be provided and explained. By offering evidence-based insights from the Lurie Center for Autism team, specialists who work almost exclusively with the ASD population, this guide seeks to empower healthcare providers to make informed decisions when prescribing medications to their patients with ASD and co-occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms. By equipping general providers to manage routine ASD care effectively, patients can receive a higher standard of care.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^112b87dm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we present what we deem are the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology. In this paper, we specifically addressed common pitfalls in the pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder. Pitfalls in the treatment of other disorders are addressed in a separate paper (part II).

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^115HqrYc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: When using antipsychotics in young people, particularly in children, it is important to consider efficacy and tolerability when adjusting doses. Adjusting dosages based solely on body weight has not been found adequate. Although a general recommendation for antipsychotic therapy is to "start slow and go slow", one common pitfall is not to use full dosages due to concerns about avoiding adverse events. In the event of a lack of efficacy, clinicians should raise dosages to the maximum recommended while monitoring for adverse events. However, increasing antipsychotic dosages above the maximum recommended dose — a common pitfall in cases with inadequate response — should also be avoided, as it is associated with greater differences in side effects than in efficacy. It is important to note that abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medications can cause withdrawal dyskinesia and a syndrome of deteriorating behavior in children and adolescents.

- **Management of treatment-resistant psychosis**: Managing treatment resistance is also challenging in children and adolescents with psychosis. There is high variability across practitioners in the waiting time before switching to another antipsychotic in case of treatment non-response. Although recommendations from guidelines may differ, waiting more than 6 weeks in case of no improvement in psychotic symptoms or functioning is not supported by evidence and should be avoided. A common practice in case of non-response, besides increasing dosages above the maximum recommended dose, is to use an antipsychotic combination.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatitis has been reported.

The importance of an 'exit strategy' when prescribing antipsychotics for challenging behaviours: Evidence on the use of low doses of antipsychotics for disruptive behaviours in children is limited to short-term studies. Notably, as in individuals with disabilities, pharmacological treatments are often unnecessarily long, without discontinuation even following a persisting clinical improvement. An 'exit strategy', which involves discussing the need to consider stopping a medication once the disruptive behaviour is stabilised, should always be planned with the patients and their caregivers.

### Flapping tremor: Unraveling asterixis - A narrative review [^116HSeqT]. Medicina (2024). High credibility.

Asterixis can be caused by various factors, including liver cirrhosis, uremic encephalopathy, urea cycle disorders, hypoglycemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. Electrolyte imbalances such as hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia are also contributing factors. Additionally, asterixis may arise due to conditions like Wilson's disease, acute liver failure, acute decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, acute ischemic stroke, metabolic encephalopathy, acute hypercapnia, benzodiazepine overdose, barbiturate overdose, hyperammonemia, and sepsis.

Certain medications have been associated with causing asterixis:

- **Opioids**: Morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine ER, fentanyl citrate, fentanyl ER
- **Anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers**: Divalproex ER, phenytoin, phenytoin ER, divalproex DR
- **Antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents**: Ceftazidime, ceftazidime/avibactam, ifosfamide
- **Lithium preparations**: Lithium carbonate ER, lithium citrate, lithium carbonate
- **Other medications**: Tretinoin, bumetanide

### Falls in older adults: Approach and prevention [^112Awzkj]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for falls in the elderly, specifically in the context of medication review, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the prescription of polypharmacy, drugs that increase the risk of falls, and drugs that meet the criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults as defined by the American Geriatrics Society. Use validated tools, such as the STOPP/START, to guide in deprescribing.

### Diagnostic error in mental health: a review [^116UQ4HV]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Although existing studies on diagnostic error have highlighted potential intervention targets, few have tested specific strategies to improve diagnostic decision-making and reduce errors in psychiatric diagnosis. We are aware of only two publications that evaluated individual-level interventions to facilitate clinician cognition in "real time". In a randomized study of 475 clinicians assigning diagnoses based on vignettes, the use of checklists to facilitate assessment (compared to no checklists) resulted in fewer false-positive diagnoses of MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. However, checklist use also led to underdetection of MDD.

Another study randomized 137 mental health professionals to receive brief education about pediatric bipolar disorder versus education about cognitive biases and corrective strategies, prior to evaluating four vignettes. Participants in the "de-biasing" condition gave more accurate diagnostic impressions and made fewer errors. Although both studies were conducted within low-fidelity simulations, they join a larger body of work suggesting that cognitive interventions may improve clinicians' diagnostic performance.

Distributing the work of diagnosis among team members is another potential avenue for intervention that emerges from the literature. In a randomized trial, 296 new psychiatric outpatients were randomized to receive usual care versus the addition of a structured clinical interview (SCID) conducted by a psychiatric nurse within 2 weeks.

### Percocet [^116P4zse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Percocet should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest period of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions, such as the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due to both the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

- **Respiratory depression** can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Compro [^114o9RuK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of neuroleptic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether neuroleptic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of neuroleptic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a

### Glatiramer acetate [^117GiG9d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Medication errors have occurred when glatiramer acetate products are administered with incompatible autoinjectors. Some glatiramer acetate products can be administered by an optional compatible autoinjector, should one be available; however, not all glatiramer acetate products have a marketed optional compatible autoinjector for administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Using an optional autoinjector that is not compatible with Mylan's glatiramer acetate injection may increase the risk for medication errors, such as dose omission or administration of a partial dose.

If using an optional autoinjector for administration, ensure the device is compatible for use with the specific glatiramer acetate product by referring to the autoinjector labeling. The availability of compatible autoinjectors for each glatiramer acetate product may change with time.

### Look-alike, sound-alike (LASA) drugs in India [^112DkQiU]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). Low credibility.

The government should insist that generic medicines are not approved without conducting Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (BA-BE) studies. Completion of BA-BE studies is a requirement for exported drugs and could be implemented for the generic medicines currently being sold in India. Such a move would make doctors more confident in prescribing generic medicines.

The first step, however, to changing the currently prevalent practice is by ensuring that information related to prescription practices — guidelines, regulations, and the harm of poor prescription practices on the public — reaches every practicing physician in the country. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission maintains a Healthcare Professional Registry, which includes practitioners from both modern and traditional systems of medicine. Healthcare providers (HCPs), especially from remote areas, could be encouraged to register on this platform. The government could then use the platform to convey relevant information, notify alerts, and organize periodic online or offline training to keep HCPs updated. National professional bodies could also support their members by updating them frequently using newsletters or bulletins. Frequent training of healthcare professionals and pharmacists in prescription writing and updating them on common LASA drugs in their practice could also help reduce medication errors. Simultaneously, regulatory bodies and hospital administration could set guidelines for regular audits of charts to detect and record the prevalence of medication errors due to LASA drugs.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^1165GgDG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem are the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology. This paper focuses on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder.

We have grouped the pitfalls by the disorder to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls related to the treatment of other disorders — such as autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy, and psychosis — are addressed in a separate paper (Part II).

### Lamictal XR [^116AbVWt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential medication errors**: Medication errors involving Lamictal XR have been reported. Specifically, the names "Lamictal" or "lamotrigine" can be mistaken for other commonly used medications. Errors may also occur between different formulations of Lamictal. To minimize these errors, it is crucial to write and pronounce "Lamictal XR" clearly. The Medication Guide provides depictions of the Lamictal XR extended-release tablets. Each tablet has a unique color and a white center, printed with "LAMICTAL XR" and displays the tablet strength. These features help identify the drug's different presentations and may reduce error risk. Lamictal XR is packaged in round, unit-of-use bottles with orange caps, each containing 30 tablets. The label displays tablet depictions to inform patients and pharmacists that the medication is Lamictal XR and specifies the tablet strength included. The unit-of-use bottle, with its distinctive orange cap and label features, helps identify the drug's presentations and may reduce error risk. Patients should be advised to visually inspect their tablets to confirm they are Lamictal XR each time they refill their prescription.

### Fluoxetine [^112exWgS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform your healthcare provider about all the medicines you are taking, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Fluoxetine and some medicines may interact, may not function effectively, or could lead to serious side effects. Your healthcare provider or pharmacist can advise if it is safe to take fluoxetine with your other medications. Do not start or stop any medicine while taking fluoxetine without consulting your healthcare provider first.

- **Taking fluoxetine**: Take fluoxetine exactly as prescribed. Your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose until it is the correct dose for you. Fluoxetine may be taken with or without food. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not take two doses of fluoxetine at the same time. If you take too much fluoxetine, contact your healthcare provider or poison control center immediately, or seek emergency treatment.

- **What to avoid**: Fluoxetine can cause sleepiness or affect your ability to make decisions, think clearly, or react quickly. Avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or engaging in dangerous activities until you understand how fluoxetine affects you. Do not consume alcohol while using fluoxetine.

### Buphenyl [^112kUyht]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Medications affecting drug breakdown**: Probenecid, a medication used to treat gout, may affect the way the kidneys excrete Buphenyl (consult your doctor for details).

- **Common side effects**: The most common side effect reported in premenopausal women taking Buphenyl was absent or irregular menstrual periods. Decreased appetite was reported in 4% of all people treated. Body odor and bad taste were each reported in 3% of all patients treated. A breakdown product of Buphenyl has been associated mainly with sleepiness and light-headedness. Because these symptoms may also be due to the urea cycle going out of control, a doctor should see the patient immediately if these symptoms occur, so the cause can be determined. Blood tests should be performed periodically for adverse effects and for levels of medication and its breakdown products.

- **Storage instructions**: Buphenyl should be stored in a tightly closed bottle at room temperature.

This leaflet provides a brief summary of the information available on Buphenyl. The information here is incomplete and is not designed to take the place of your doctor's instructions. For more complete information, consult your physician, or contact Horizon at 1–866–479–6742.

### Amnesteem [^115Vt2Te]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amnesteem may cause depression, psychosis, and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric]. Prescribers should read the brochure "Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin". Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need.

Therefore, prior to the initiation of Amnesteem therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorders. At each visit during therapy, patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure "Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults", include the following:

- **Emotional symptoms**: sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness
- **Behavioral changes**: loss of pleasure or interest in activities, acting on dangerous impulses
- **Cognitive symptoms**: difficulty concentrating, suicidal thoughts or attempts
- **Physical symptoms**: fatigue, persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment
- **Changes in routine**: change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite
- **Other symptoms**: restlessness, irritability

Patients should stop Amnesteem, and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit.

### The problem with how we view medical (and diagnostic) error in emergency medicine [^113BANG6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Error does not equal harm. Confusing harm with "error" is, at best, misleading, is often obfuscating, and can be highly destructive, especially to clinicians trying to do the best they can in difficult circumstances. This leads harm to be considered a professional problem and ignores the real hazards faced by patients and clinicians. Moreover, it dissuades deeper exploration, including how clinicians effectively adapt and respond every day to avoid hazards that contribute to harm.

This perspective ignores the system, work complexity, and the characteristic of clinical expertise in the trade-offs that need to be made to deliver care within an imperfect, complex, hazardous, and uncertain world. Emergency department providers operate in and use a variety of tools to perform competing tasks with limited resources and uncertain information, often in crowded environments and with expectations of production pressure. As a result, every decision has a degree of risk associated with it. Instead of labeling harm as "error", we should view harm as a product of process failures and from interactions within a sociotechnical system (STS). Clinical expertise is, in part, about everyday harm-reducing behaviors.

This perspective moves away from "blame and retrain", and safety becomes about supporting clinicians in building expertise and systems resilience. The case vignette demonstrates a successful recovery from errors in the process of diagnosis, thereby not resulting in harm. In this case, multiple individuals (emergency physician, radiologist, and the patient) contributed to error recovery through their actions. A key factor in such error recovery is…

### Inequalities in health system coverage and quality: A cross-sectional survey of four Latin American countries [^117AePxd]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

At least half of respondents reported having preventive checks in the past 12 months, with up to three-quarters in Colombia and Uruguay having preventive checks (figure 1C), although complete checks for cardiovascular disease among older adults (men aged ≥ 40 years and women aged ≥ 50 years) were less than 50% in all countries and even lower in Peru. Continuity of care was notably higher in Uruguay (64%) compared with the other countries. Medical mistakes were least commonly reported in Mexico (no mistakes reported by 94%) and most commonly reported in Peru (84% without mistakes). Reported confidence in care quality, affordability, and responsiveness exceeded half of respondents only in Mexico, where confidence in care quality and government responsiveness was nearly double the prevalence elsewhere (figure 1D). Government management of the COVID-19 pandemic was rated worst in Peru (13% favourable), poorly in Mexico and Colombia (24–26% favourable), and well in Uruguay (55% favourable).

### Onfi [^112BtKye]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients or caregivers to consult with their healthcare provider before taking Onfi with other CNS depressants such as other benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, or alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)].

Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Onfi does not adversely affect them, impairing judgment, thinking, or motor skills.

Inform patients or caregivers that Onfi is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Counsel women to also use non-hormonal methods of contraception when Onfi is used with hormonal contraceptives and to continue these alternative methods for 28 days after discontinuing Onfi to ensure contraceptive reliability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Advise patients or caregivers that serious skin reactions have been reported in Onfi users. Serious skin reactions, including SJS/TEN, may require hospital treatment and could be life-threatening. If a skin reaction occurs while taking Onfi, patients or caregivers should consult with healthcare providers immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Diagnostic error in mental health: a review [^114MRzta]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Timely and appropriate diagnosis in mental health is an essential first step towards effective treatment. Missed, delayed, or wrong diagnosis of mental disorders can lead to poorer patient outcomes and can waste time and resources. For example, delayed diagnosis of bipolar disorder has been linked to more frequent relapse and hospitalizations. In a large registry study of over 1000 patients with narcolepsy, over one-quarter of the sample reported having consulted five or more clinicians before receiving the diagnosis. Missed and delayed diagnoses can also result in a lack of functional improvement, delayed remission, and delayed or unnecessary treatments.

Mental disorders are largely clinical diagnoses that seldom have specific objective findings that can be detected through laboratory testing, physical examination, or imaging. As such, history taking, behavioral observation, and data gathering from collateral sources (e.g. family members, teachers) are essential to the diagnosis. Despite the importance of effective data gathering and synthesis, time pressures, competing priorities, and various cognitive biases can interfere with this process. Validated psychological tests and symptom reporting scales can help with the data gathering process, but these can lead to inaccurate diagnostic impressions if they are interpreted without sufficient context or not followed with an appropriate diagnostic interview. Finally, evolving (and in some cases, expanding) diagnostic criteria for mental disorders have prompted concerns that clinicians could inadvertently pathologize normal variations in behavior.

### Intuniv [^114Afy91]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Inform your doctor about all the medications you take, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements, as INTUNIV may influence the efficacy of other medications, and vice versa.

- **Important drug interactions**: Be particularly cautious if you take ketoconazole, medications affecting enzyme metabolism, high blood pressure medications, sedatives, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or antipsychotics. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a comprehensive list.

- **Medication record management**: Keep an updated list of all the medications you take and show it to your doctor or pharmacist when you start any new medication.

- **Dosage instructions for INTUNIV**:
	- Follow your doctor's instructions regarding INTUNIV usage. Your doctor may adjust your dose, so do not alter your dose without their consultation.
	- Do not discontinue INTUNIV without discussing it with your doctor.
	- If you miss a dose, take the next one at the regular time. If you miss two or more doses, consult your doctor as you might need to restart INTUNIV at a lower dose. Avoid taking a double dose to compensate for a missed dose.
	- INTUNIV should be taken once daily, either alone or with an ADHD stimulant medication, as advised by your doctor. It can be taken in the morning or evening.
	- Swallow INTUNIV whole with a small amount of water, milk, or another liquid. Do not crush, chew, or break the tablets. If swallowing whole is not possible, inform your doctor.

### Why inflammatory reductionism is a threat to psychiatry (and the rest of medicine) [^113tD4vk]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

One might want to ask, "so what?" Is it really so bad for the culture to self-diagnose with implausible inflammatory disorders? This is just a fad, right? A cry for help from a civilization struggling under the weight of its own modernity? We'll work it out. After all, are the diagnostic categories of psychiatry really any better, or are they basically arbitrary anyway, a series of tick boxes agreed upon by men in meeting rooms, with no real ontological status or plausible mechanism?

Inappropriately prescribing potentially harmful immunosuppressive drugs as a result of misdiagnosed CNS autoimmunity is a real danger, and one that may become more common, particularly in less regulated health systems.

- **Stigma**: There is another side to this coin, one that is potentially far more harmful. While the "inflammatory turn" in psychiatry is a welcome shift in principle, as it expands the repertoire of explanatory models, in practice it increasingly entails an unwillingness to consider more biopsychosocial explanations or treatments, which are increasingly dismissed as "medical gaslighting". Whereas antipsychiatry once came from critics who argued that psychiatrists are complicit in the inappropriate medicalization of everyday suffering, today some of the most hostile criticisms come from voices arguing that psychiatrists do not medicalize enough, that we are so ideologically committed to "psychologizing" everything we see that we fail to recognize the biological (inflammatory) realities staring us in the face.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following the naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours.

	- The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

	- **Intravenous**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone. Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal. If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone. Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

The provision of too much medicine — likely to cause more harm than good — is a pervasive problem in high-income countries. Directly measuring medicine overuse is challenging due to the difficulty of defining appropriate care for patients with individual preferences and needs. Indirect approaches, through examinations of variations in the prevalence of procedures, prescriptions, and intensity of care, suggest that high-income countries face high rates of overuse across a wide range of services and prescriptions. Overuse can detrimentally impact patients' health, both physically and psychologically, and strain the healthcare system by squandering resources and funds that could be more effectively allocated elsewhere.

Past research indicates that physicians' level of medical risk literacy, and as a variant of risk literacy, their numeracy, can considerably influence their recommendations and decisions. Medical risk literacy refers to the cognitive ability to understand and interpret numerical statistical information (e.g. relative vs. absolute risk) related to medical interventions. While these studies provide important insights into the role of these cognitive abilities on physicians' judgments and decisions, their significance is limited because they usually employ hypothetical scenarios and do not investigate real-world behavior. Little is known about how risk literacy impacts physicians' real-world prescribing practices, especially in the context of potentially hazardous drugs like antibiotics, opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines.

### Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals [^115T7QAh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials, non-randomized controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS), and repeated measures studies. These studies assessed the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rate. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunization. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) and the number of false…

### Let us talk about mistakes [^1155XPsT]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Errors and mistakes are unfortunately part of life. They can harm patients and incur unplanned costs, arising from various sources classified as systematic, latent, or active. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to incorrect decisions. In addition to cognitive biases, factors such as personality, socialization, personal chronobiology, and thinking style (heuristic versus analytical) play a role. Moreover, overload from private situations, long commuting times, and the complex information technology environment must also be considered.

The objective of this paper is to define and classify errors and mistakes in radiology, discuss influencing factors, and present strategies for prevention. Hierarchical responsibilities and team "well-being" are also discussed.

### Gralise [^1143595M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be advised about the availability of a medication guide and instructed to read it prior to taking Gralise. It is important to inform patients that Gralise is not interchangeable with other formulations of gabapentin and must be taken only as prescribed. Gralise may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression.

Patients should not drive or operate complex machinery until they have gained enough experience with Gralise to determine whether it affects their mental or motor performance negatively. Those requiring concomitant treatment with morphine should inform their prescriber if they experience signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence. In such cases, the dose of Gralise or morphine should be reduced accordingly.

If a dose of Gralise is missed, patients should take it with food as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, they should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time, avoiding taking two doses simultaneously.

In cases of overdose, patients should immediately contact their healthcare provider or poison control center or proceed to the nearest emergency room.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^113cKG5T]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

**Discussion**: Integration of deprescribing recommendations into clinical practice guidelines has been proposed as a mechanism to minimize potentially inappropriate medicine use and reduce medicine-related harm. The large number of deprescribing recommendations identified in this review (n = 316), as well as the upward trend in guidelines containing deprescribing recommendations over time, may reflect a growing awareness of the need to consider deprescribing. However, less than one-third of potentially eligible guidelines identified in the registries search contained a deprescribing recommendation, and only 7% of evidence-based recommendations from the 80 included guidelines pertained to deprescribing. Additionally, less than half of these guidelines had a deprescribing recommendation for all medications with a prescribing recommendation. Such findings indicate a paucity of adequate deprescribing guidance and a need for developers to consider including deprescribing when defining the scope of guidelines and when formulating recommendations.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^115f1UqM]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The literature provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the mediator between SES and health conditions. SES is closely linked to residents' ability to access technological information on medical services. For instance, residents with low SES could experience more challenges owing to the lack of electronic equipment and the need to pay a fee for accessing information because their disposable income is relatively low, giving them relatively scarce access to social resources. Compared with high-SES residents, those with low SES have fewer opportunities to learn and practice technological skills, resulting in greater technological challenges when accessing technological information.

Research has indicated that technological challenges significantly impact residents' health conditions. First, technological challenges impact residents' access to healthcare tips and disease prevention information. In China, the government and non-profit organizations have tried to publish healthcare information and care service tips on social media over the last 10 years. However, residents with limited access to modern technology receive less relevant information, reducing their chances of receiving comprehensive medical services. Second, medical institutions rely on innovative technology for sharing diagnostic and treatment information, requiring patients to make appointments and access screening results online before visiting doctors. Residents with low SES may have difficulties using such technology, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities.

### General practitioners' risk literacy and real-world prescribing of potentially hazardous drugs: A cross-sectional study [^113NW6cW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Physicians worldwide provide low-value care for numerous reasons. Our study suggests a new and previously unexplored dimension to the problem of overuse and low-value care: physicians' ability to correctly understand and deal with medical statistics. Given the devastating effects that unnecessary prescriptions of potentially hazardous drugs can have on patients' health and safety, further studies are needed to investigate the generalisability of our findings in other healthcare settings and delve deeper into associations with other contributing factors (e.g. barriers to timely healthcare access) in order to better understand what undermines the practice of evidence-based prescribing.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^112GBnSd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Tics**: Assessing the effectiveness of drug treatments requires allowing sufficient time. The natural course of tics is a waxing (increasing) and waning (decreasing) pattern over weeks or months. Over hours and days, tics can worsen due to factors such as anxiety, anger, excitement, or tiredness. Tics often wax during stressful periods, such as the start of a new school year or during exams. A common pitfall is to prematurely assume that treatment is effective when simply observing a natural waning phase, or conversely, that a drug treatment is ineffective during a natural waxing phase. To avoid these pitfalls, it is important to evaluate treatment effects over a sufficiently long period, usually 2–3 months, to compare peaks (waxing phases) and troughs (waning phases) before and after treatment initiation.

- **Diagnosis accuracy**: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented rise in functional tics, particularly in teenage girls. Functional tics can be difficult to differentiate from a primary tic disorder and may co-occur with primary tics. As functional tics are not responsive to standard tic medications, a common pitfall occurs when there is failure to observe a tic treatment response at standard doses, leading to continued dose escalation and increased adverse effects. Another diagnostic pitfall is related to motor mannerisms and stereotypies that occur in autism, which can mimic complex motor tics but are not responsive to tic treatments.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^1169DRJZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

In recent years, the implementation of modern technology in medical care services, such as online appointment booking and digital access to medical test results, has become popular, helping to improve service delivery efficiency and accelerate medical service utilization. For example, patients can now access services, book appointments, or check test results more conveniently and quickly, instead of waiting long hours in medical care institutions. However, scholars have argued that innovations may introduce access-related challenges for older adults or those with low educational levels, potentially excluding those who struggle with technology from effectively using medical care services.

Consequently, people's health conditions may worsen because of their inability to access medical care services, and they may feel isolated owing to these challenges — especially those with a low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is among the most important indicators for analyzing residents' social policy utilization, studied extensively in fields like sociology, management, and other disciplines. Therefore, it is essential to explore whether individuals with different SES perceive technological challenges differently when accessing medical care services.

Consequently, we are interested in how differences in urban–rural residency impact perceptions of technological challenges when accessing medical care resources across different SES levels. Scientific evidence highlights disparities in urban–rural medical resources within China, with residents experiencing varying degrees of access.

### Adzenys XR-ODT [^115nxZHT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Potential for overdose due to medication errors: Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between Adzenys XR-ODT and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Aridol bronchial challenge test kit [^112dNwDc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings & precautions**: Severe bronchospasm may occur with ARIDOL in susceptible patients. Administration should be conducted by trained professionals under a physician's supervision. Necessary medications and equipment for treating severe bronchospasm must be readily available in the testing area. Use with caution in patients with certain co-morbid conditions, such as severe cough, ventilatory impairment, unstable angina, or active upper or lower respiratory tract infections, as these may exacerbate sensitivity to bronchoconstricting or other effects of ARIDOL.

- **Severe bronchospasm**: Mannitol, the active ingredient in ARIDOL, acts as a bronchoconstrictor and may cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Only trained professionals should conduct the test under a physician's supervision who is familiar with the bronchial challenge test and management of acute bronchospasm. Patients should not be left unattended during the test. Medications and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area.

	- If a patient experiences a ≥ 10% reduction in FEV1 (from pre-challenge FEV1) upon administration of the 0 mg capsule, discontinue the ARIDOL Bronchial Challenge Test immediately. The patient should then receive a dose of a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist and be monitored accordingly. Patients exhibiting either a positive response to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL or significant respiratory symptoms should be given a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist for relief.

### Risk of hospitalisation for first-onset psychosis or mania within a year of ADHD medication initiation in adults with ADHD [^112HAgMX]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder among children, characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Although some core symptoms, particularly motor hyperactivity, become less prominent with age, over half of those diagnosed with childhood ADHD continue to experience persistent symptoms into adulthood.

The prescription of ADHD drugs has increased sharply in Iceland in recent years, particularly for adults. In 2010, 1.5% of women (786 of 53,105) and 1.6% of men (894 of 54,872) aged 18–44 were prescribed ADHD medication. In 2023, the percentages had risen to 11% for women (5,972 of 54,503) and 9.4% for men (5,373 of 57,074) in that age group. In 2023, 14.7% of youth aged 7–17 were dispensed a prescription for ADHD medication, as well as 10.2% of adults aged 18–44, with the prevalence being notably higher among certain age groups of youth and young adults. This use of ADHD medications in Iceland is higher than the estimated prevalence of the disorder, which is in the range of 2.2%–7.2% among children and 2.5%–5.2% among adults. In Iceland, only psychiatrists or pediatricians with experience in diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders can initiate treatment with ADHD drugs following an ADHD diagnosis. The diagnostic workup is most commonly done by a psychologist or a psychiatrist, or at least confirmed by a psychiatrist.

### Gohibic [^1174iaNM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The prescribing healthcare provider or the provider's designee is responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events (SAEs) and medication errors potentially related to Gohibic within 7 calendar days from the provider's awareness of the event, using FDA Form 3500. The FDA requires that such reports include the following:

- **Patient demographics and baseline characteristics**: For example, patient identifier, age or date of birth, gender, weight, ethnicity, and race.
- **Statement required**: Include "Gohibic use for COVID-19 under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)" under the "Describe Event, Problem, or Product Use/Medication Error" heading.
- **Information about the SAE or medication error**: Signs and symptoms, test/laboratory data, complications, timing of drug initiation in relation to the occurrence of the event, duration of the event, treatments required to mitigate the event, evidence of event improvement or disappearance after stopping or reducing the dosage, evidence of event reappearance after reintroduction, and clinical outcomes.
- **Patient's preexisting medical conditions and use of concomitant products**.
- **Information about the product**: Dosage, route of administration, and NDC number.
