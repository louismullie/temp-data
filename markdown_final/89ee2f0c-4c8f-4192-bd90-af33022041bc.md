## Question

Creutzfeld-jacobs disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and classification. Then, I should verify epidemiology and clinical features. Next, I will examine the diagnostic criteria and the modern biomarker landscape, including MRI, RT-QuIC, and CSF markers. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and pitfalls. Then, I will review management and prognosis. Finally, I should consider public health, surveillance, and emerging directions, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and classification. CJD is a human prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive neurodegeneration with spongiform change and accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc), and it is universally fatal; it is classified into sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic, and variant forms, with sporadic CJD (sCJD) comprising roughly 85–90% of cases, genetic forms 10–15%, and acquired forms less than 1% [^115rdYoX] [^1133qL6j].

> I should double-check the epidemiology and basic clinical phenotype. sCJD has a worldwide incidence of about 1–2 per million per year, with mean onset in the late 60s and median survival around 4–5 months; variant CJD (vCJD) is much rarer, tends to present in younger individuals, and carries a longer median survival of roughly 13–14 months, though incubation can extend for years after exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [^1133qL6j] [^115L1va1] [^111jg9iz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features being uniform. I need to ensure I capture heterogeneity: sCJD typically presents with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, and visual disturbances, but atypical phenotypes occur, including psychiatric or sensory-predominant onsets, and even stroke-like presentations; vCJD more often begins with psychiatric symptoms and painful dysesthesias before neurologic signs emerge, which can mislead early diagnostic pathways [^111i7g9n] [^11687axJ] [^111jg9iz].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework and its evolution. Historically, diagnosis relied on clinical features plus EEG and CSF 14–3–3, but the 2017 revised International CJD Surveillance Network criteria incorporated MRI cortical ribboning and CSF RT-QuIC, substantially improving antemortem sensitivity while maintaining specificity; neuropathology remains the gold standard for definite diagnosis, but modern criteria enable high-confidence probable diagnoses in life [^112nqrM6] [^111pXbEM] [^113qeCJX].

> Wait, let me verify the performance of MRI patterns because misinterpretation is common. DWI and FLAIR demonstrate cortical ribboning and/or basal ganglia hyperintensity with high diagnostic yield; in a large validation, cortical ribboning was about 68% sensitive and 87% specific, and when combined with RT-QuIC and elevated CSF total tau, diagnostic sensitivity approached 97% in contemporary cohorts; importantly, MRI sensitivity can be lower in psychiatric-predominant presentations early on, so serial imaging is often helpful [^111pXbEM] [^111Q9KRC] [^111q2PmW].

> I will now examine RT-QuIC, since this has reshaped pre-mortem diagnosis. CSF RT-QuIC detects prion seeding activity with approximately 92–97% sensitivity and near 100% specificity in validated series; second-generation assays may further increase sensitivity and shorten turnaround, though false negatives occur in a minority, so a negative RT-QuIC does not exclude CJD when clinical suspicion is high; olfactory mucosa sampling can be an alternative substrate with excellent performance in some studies [^111pXbEM] [^114qMY6h] [^111mqE34].

> Let me consider CSF biomarkers beyond RT-QuIC. Total tau greater than about 1149 pg/mL shows high diagnostic sensitivity and correlates with disease aggressiveness; by contrast, 14–3–3 protein has limited sensitivity and specificity in the modern era and should be interpreted cautiously, especially outside a compatible clinical-imaging context; nonetheless, elevated 14–3–3 and T-tau can portend shorter survival and remain prognostically informative [^113VJ9Jc] [^111q2PmW] [^111VJWBX].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of EEG because it is often over-weighted. Periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) are classically linked to sCJD but are relatively insensitive early and can be absent in several molecular subtypes; thus, a normal EEG does not exclude CJD, and reliance on EEG alone risks delays in diagnosis and care planning [^113VJ9Jc] [^111q2PmW].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and avoid premature closure. Autoimmune encephalitis, toxic-metabolic derangements, paraneoplastic syndromes, and other neurodegenerative diseases can mimic CJD; warning features of a mimic include generalized seizures, systemic illness, contrast-enhancing lesions, CSF pleocytosis, or MRI hyperintensity outside typical cortical/striatal/thalamic regions; in younger patients, inherited prion disease and vCJD must be considered, and PRNP sequencing is appropriate when suspicion persists [^1162pmqM] [^116xZcFL] [^1125mh99].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic algorithm is explicit. In suspected sCJD, obtain brain MRI with DWI and FLAIR, CSF for RT-QuIC and total tau (14–3–3 can be added but interpreted cautiously), and EEG; if these are non-diagnostic but suspicion remains high, repeat MRI and CSF testing, consider olfactory mucosa RT-QuIC, and pursue PRNP sequencing to evaluate for genetic prion disease; brain biopsy is rarely indicated and reserved for unresolved differentials after noninvasive testing, given modest diagnostic yield and procedural risk [^113qeCJX] [^111mqE34] [^113C3vYx].

> Let me think about management and prognosis, and I should confirm there is no disease-modifying therapy. Treatment is supportive, focusing on symptom control for myoclonus, rigidity, and psychiatric symptoms, safety, nutrition, and early palliative care and hospice involvement; median survival remains approximately 4–5 months for sCJD, with myoclonus, visual or cerebellar signs, and elevated CSF 14–3–3 or T-tau associated with shorter survival; experimental therapies such as PRN100 have been explored in limited contexts, but efficacy remains unproven [^115L1va1] [^113VJ9Jc] [^1143bjBN].

> But wait, what about public health and surveillance. CJD is transmissible under specific iatrogenic circumstances, with documented transmission via dural grafts, neurosurgical instruments, corneal transplantation, and blood transfusion in vCJD; incubation can span decades, so ongoing surveillance remains vital despite declining vCJD incidence; standard infection control precautions suffice for routine clinical care, whereas enhanced decontamination protocols are required for high-risk neurosurgical instruments [^1133qL6j] [^115rdYoX] [^1153PKQo].

> I should double-check emerging directions. Blood-based assays and next-generation RT-QuIC platforms are under active development and may enable earlier, less invasive detection; machine learning approaches to survival prediction are being explored to support care planning and trial stratification; and while several therapeutic candidates are in preclinical or early clinical phases, robust disease-modifying benefit has not yet been demonstrated [^1143bjBN] [^115VGfh5] [^113qeCJX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent: CJD is a rare, rapidly fatal prion disease with heterogeneous presentations; modern diagnosis hinges on MRI cortical ribboning and basal ganglia changes, CSF RT-QuIC and total tau, and careful exclusion of mimics; early recognition enables appropriate supportive care, public health precautions, and potential trial enrollment, even as definitive diagnosis still rests on neuropathology in select cases [^112nqrM6] [^111pXbEM] [^111kmktd].

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a **rapidly progressive, fatal prion disease** [^1143bjBN] characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, visual disturbances, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, with a median survival of ~4–5 months [^115L1va1]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus MRI, EEG, and CSF biomarkers** [^113qeCJX], with RT-QuIC providing high sensitivity and specificity [^111mqE34] [^111pXbEM]. There is **no cure or disease-modifying therapy** [^1143bjBN]; management is supportive, and strict infection control is essential due to prion resistance to standard sterilization [^1153PKQo]. Early, accurate diagnosis enables appropriate care, family counseling, and public health measures [^117Tf2Nk].

---

## Clinical features

CJD presents with a **characteristic constellation of neurological symptoms**:

- **Rapidly progressive dementia**: Cognitive decline occurring over weeks to months [^113qeCJX].
- **Myoclonus**: Involuntary muscle jerking, often stimulus-sensitive [^111i7g9n].
- **Ataxia**: Cerebellar incoordination and gait disturbances [^1165wa4d].
- **Visual disturbances**: Including visual field defects and cortical blindness [^1111AqqN].
- **Pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs**: Motor rigidity, spasticity, and movement disorders [^113e9aue].
- **Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms**: Depression, anxiety, and personality changes [^1114b2r3].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

The diagnosis of CJD is established using a combination of **clinical features and ancillary tests**:

| **Diagnostic category** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Definite CJD | Neuropathological confirmation via brain biopsy or autopsy demonstrating spongiform changes, neuronal loss, gliosis, and prion protein deposition [^1165wa4d] |
| Probable CJD | - Rapidly progressive dementia <br/> - At least two of the following: myoclonus, ataxia, visual disturbances, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, or akinetic mutism <br/> - Positive MRI (cortical ribboning, basal ganglia hyperintensity) [^1128sUuz] <br/> - Positive RT-QuIC assay [^111pXbEM] <br/> - Or characteristic EEG findings (periodic sharp wave complexes) [^111i7g9n] |
| Possible CJD | - Rapidly progressive dementia <br/> - At least two of the following: myoclonus, ataxia, visual disturbances, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, or akinetic mutism <br/> - Without confirmatory MRI, RT-QuIC, or EEG findings [^notfound] |

---

MRI is highly sensitive and specific for CJD, particularly **diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)** [^116hiULW], which shows cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensity [^1128sUuz]. The **RT-QuIC assay** detects misfolded prion protein in CSF with high sensitivity and specificity, significantly improving antemortem diagnosis [^111i7g9n] [^111pXbEM].

---

## Subtypes of CJD

CJD is classified into **four main subtypes** based on etiology:

- **Sporadic CJD (sCJD)**: The most common form, accounting for approximately 85% of cases [^1133qL6j]. It occurs spontaneously without identifiable risk factors [^1165wa4d].
- **Genetic CJD**: Caused by mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), accounting for about 10–15% of cases [^115rdYoX].
- **Iatrogenic CJD**: Resulting from medical procedures such as contaminated surgical instruments, dura mater grafts, or human growth hormone injections [^1153PKQo].
- **Variant CJD (vCJD)**: Linked to consumption of beef products contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions [^111jg9iz]. It primarily affects younger individuals and has distinct clinical and pathological features [^11151m9c].

---

## Pathophysiology

CJD is characterized by the accumulation of **abnormally folded prion protein (PrPSc)** in the brain, which induces misfolding of normal prion protein (PrPC), leading to neuronal death, spongiform degeneration, gliosis, and synaptic dysfunction [^1143bjBN]. This process is **transmissible under specific conditions**, contributing to its classification as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) [^113kFA8c].

---

## Treatment and management

There is **no cure or disease-modifying therapy** for CJD [^1165wa4d]. Management is supportive and palliative, focusing on symptom control, comfort care, and psychological support for patients and families [^1165wa4d]. Strict infection control measures are essential due to the resistance of prions to standard sterilization methods [^1153PKQo].

---

## Prognosis

CJD has a **poor prognosis**, with rapid disease progression and high mortality [^1133qL6j]. Median survival is approximately 4–5 months from symptom onset, with most patients dying within a year [^115L1va1]. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate care planning, family counseling, and public health measures [^117Tf2Nk].

---

## Public health implications

CJD surveillance is essential for monitoring disease incidence, identifying outbreaks, and preventing iatrogenic transmission [^113kFA8c]. International surveillance networks have been established to coordinate efforts and share information [^114r1TQd]. Continued vigilance is necessary due to the potential for emerging prion diseases and the prolonged incubation periods associated with prion infections [^1133qL6j].

---

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare, rapidly progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by prion protein misfolding [^1143bjBN]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features supported by MRI, EEG, and CSF biomarkers, with RT-QuIC significantly improving antemortem accuracy [^111pXbEM]. There is **no cure**, so management is supportive, and strict infection control is essential [^1153PKQo].

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is one of the sample prion diseases that have characteristic features of rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease manifested by psychomotor changes, some of which include cognitive dysfunction, motor disorder, and behavioral abnormalities. In general, this brief review will assist in elucidating the clinical features and onset, causes, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic possibilities of CJD. It is classified into sporadic, hereditary, and acquired forms, and affection is identified as linked to the different prion varieties and genetic profiles. The disease process of CJD consists of the deposition of misfolded prions in the brain that causes apoptosis and the subsequent morphological features in the form of spongiform changes. Diagnostic strategies have changed; presently, one can see imaging methods, diagnosis through CSF biomarkers, and genetic-based diagnosis. At this time, there is no cure for CJD; therefore, management and treatment aim at supporting the patient and alleviating the signs and symptoms of the disease. As per our discussion, this review sought to accustom the readers with recent studies conducted, diagnostic advancements, and probable therapeutic approaches, pointing to the general index that more research is needed to fight CJD.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative condition with a rapid disease course and a mortality rate of 100%. Several forms of the disease have been described, and the most common is the sporadic type. The most challenging aspect of this disease is its diagnosis-the gold standard for definitive diagnosis is considered to be histopathological confirmation-but newer tests are providing means for an antemortem diagnosis in ways less invasive than brain biopsy. Imaging studies, electroencephalography, and biomarkers are used in conjunction with the clinical picture to try to make the diagnosis of CJD without brain tissue samples, and all of these are reviewed in this article. The current diagnostic criteria are limited; test sensitivity and specificity varies with the genetics of the disease as well as the clinical stage. Physicians may be unsure of all diagnostic testing available, and may order outdated tests or prematurely request a brain biopsy when the diagnostic workup is incomplete. The authors review CJD, discuss the role of brain biopsy in this patient population, provide a diagnostic pathway for the patient presenting with rapidly progressive dementia, and propose newer diagnostic criteria.

Introduction

Diagnostic criteria for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have historically emphasized archetypal clinical features and established diagnostic biomarkers. Accordingly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diagnostic criteria emphasize detection of a neuropsychiatric disorder or progressive dementia, as well as core clinical features (ie, visual or cerebellar disturbance, pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction, and akinetic mutism) and myoclonus — a hallmark clinical sign. Diagnostic biomarkers include specific findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; ie, hyperintense signal and reduced diffusivity involving cerebral cortex and corpus striatum,), characteristic electroencephalography (EEG) patterns (ie, periodic synchronous biphasic or triphasic sharp wave complexes,), and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein 14–3–3 level. The more recent discovery and validation of real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays capable of detecting malformed prion proteins in CSF has transformed the diagnostic approach to CJD, allowing the diagnosis of probable CJD to be established with higher confidence. Wide application of RT-QuIC testing and integration of results within diagnostic criteria have substantially improved recognition of affected patients, increasing prevalence estimates, broadening appreciation of the clinical phenotypes attributable to CJD, and permitting diagnoses to be established earlier in the clinical course.

The diagnostic and prognostic relevance of previously established clinical features and biomarkers associated with CJD remains unclear and warrants reevaluation in the modern era. Recognizing this, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of key clinical features and widely available tests for CJD in patients with clinically probable or definite (pathology-proven) CJD diagnosed in the RT-QuIC era. Specifically, we sought to determine the frequency of clinical features and biomarker changes at initial evaluation and to understand the associations of clinical features and diagnostic tests with disease duration.

Key Points

Question

How sensitive and specific are the 2017 revised International Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 647 individuals conducted by a multinational team of surveillance experts, the revised diagnostic criteria, which incorporate cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion assay and cortical ribboning on brain magnetic resonance imaging, were significantly more sensitive than previous criteria with no loss of specificity.

Meaning

These results suggest that the revised diagnostic criteria achieve superior diagnostic sensitivity and maintain a high degree of specificity compared with previous criteria, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for clinical care and surveillance.

### Creutzfeldt-jakob disease and other prion diseases [^1143bjBN]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Prion diseases share common clinical and pathological characteristics such as spongiform neuronal degeneration and deposition of an abnormal form of a host-derived protein, termed prion protein. The characteristic features of prion diseases are long incubation times, short clinical courses, extreme resistance of the transmissible agent to degradation and lack of nucleic acid involvement. Sporadic and genetic forms of prion diseases occur worldwide, of which genetic forms are associated with mutations in PRNP. Human to human transmission of these diseases has occurred due to iatrogenic exposure, and zoonotic forms of prion diseases are linked to bovine disease. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis of these disorders. Clinical tools for diagnosis comprise brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Aggregation assays for detection of the abnormally folded prion protein have a clear potential to diagnose the disease in peripherally accessible biofluids. After decades of therapeutic nihilism, new treatment strategies and clinical trials are on the horizon. Although prion diseases are relatively rare disorders, understanding their pathogenesis and mechanisms of prion protein misfolding has significantly enhanced the field in research of neurodegenerative diseases.

### Biomarkers and diagnostic guidelines for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^113qeCJX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by misfolded prion proteins (PrP Sc). Effective therapeutics are currently not available and accurate diagnosis can be challenging. Clinical diagnostic criteria use a combination of characteristic neuropsychiatric symptoms, CSF proteins 14–3–3, MRI, and EEG. Supportive biomarkers, such as high CSF total tau, could aid the diagnostic process. However, discordant studies have led to controversies about the clinical value of some established surrogate biomarkers. Development and clinical application of disease-specific protein aggregation and amplification assays, such as real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC), have constituted major breakthroughs for the confident pre-mortem diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Updated criteria for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including application of RT-QuIC, should improve early clinical confirmation, surveillance, assessment of PrP Sc seeding activity in different tissues, and trial monitoring. Moreover, emerging blood-based, prognostic, and potentially pre-symptomatic biomarker candidates are under investigation.

### Psychiatric and neuroimaging findings in creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1111AqqN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Although Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the prototypical rapidly progressive dementia, clinical heterogeneity in the disease can make diagnosis difficult. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects multiple brain areas, which causes multifocal deficits that involve movement, cognition, and psychiatric status. Thorough neurologic, cognitive, and psychiatric examinations are necessary for observing its clinical features. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers and clinicians to discover imaging patterns that distinguish CJD from other neurologic diseases. This article discusses how these advances may make neuroimaging the most valuable noninvasive tool for diagnosing CJD, which helps to track the progression of the disease course and provides insight into clinical-anatomic correlations.

### Unusual clinical presentations challenging the early clinical diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^11687axJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The introduction of prion RT-QuIC, an ultrasensitive specific assay for the in vivo detection of the abnormal prion protein, has significantly increased the potential for an early and accurate clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, in the clinical setting, the early identification of patients with possible CJD is often challenging. Indeed, CJD patients may present with isolated symptoms that remain the only clinical manifestation for some time, or with neurological syndromes atypical for CJD. To enhance awareness of unusual disease presentations and promote earlier diagnosis, we reviewed the entire spectrum of atypical early manifestations of CJD, mainly reported to date as case descriptions or small case series. They included sensory either visual or auditory disturbances, seizures, isolated psychiatric manifestations, atypical parkinsonian syndromes (corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy-like), pseudobulbar syndrome, isolated involuntary movements (dystonia, myoclonus, chorea, blepharospasm), acute or subacute onsets mimicking a stroke, isolated aphasia, and neuropathy. Since CJD is a rare disease and its clinical course rapidly progressive, an in-depth understanding and awareness of early clinical features are mandatory to enhance the overall diagnostic accuracy in its very early stages and to recruit optimal candidates for future therapeutic trials.

### The oldest old creutzfeldt-jakob disease case [^113AEog8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder usually affecting people between 60 and 70 years old, with only anecdotal cases presenting at 90 years or older. The clinical phenotype of sCJD is highly variable. Diagnosis of sCJD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly evolving ataxic or dementing syndromes with or without epileptic seizures, regardless of the patient age. While the recognition of atypical phenotypes in subject 90 years or older can provide additional diagnostic challenge, it must be underlined that neuropathology is still the "gold standard" for sCJD diagnosis.

Conclusions

In this study, we demonstrated the excellent performance of the revised CJD International Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria. Our results showed that the new criteria greatly enhanced in-life case classification, with improvements among cases with clinically limited sCJD and with prolonged survival. Rapid, accurate in-life diagnosis enables effective supportive care, public health interventions, and clinical trial recruitment.

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^113VJ9Jc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the diagnostic utility associated with clinical features and tests historically associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in patients evaluated in the modern era?

Findings

In this cohort study including 115 patients, the diagnostic performance of cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion assays, total tau, and stereotyped signal anomalies on magnetic resonance imaging was high, while the diagnostic yield of myoclonus and periodic discharges on electroencephalography was low. The presence of myoclonus, visual or cerebellar findings, and elevated levels of protein 14–3–3 and total tau in cerebrospinal fluid were independently associated with shorter time to death.

Meaning

These findings may guide prioritization and interpretation of accessible tests in patients with suspected CJD.

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^116sybJG]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Detection of prion proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays has transformed the diagnostic approach to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), facilitating earlier and more complete recognition of affected patients. It is unclear how expanded recognition of affected patients may affect the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of clinical features and diagnostic tests historically associated with CJD.

Objective

To evaluate clinical features and diagnostic testing in patients presenting with CJD and determine the associations of these features with prognosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study incorporated data from electronic medical records of patients with CJD treated at Mayo Clinic Enterprise tertiary care centers in Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Scottsdale, Arizona. Participants included patients with definite or probable CJD assessed from 2014 to 2021. Data were analyzed October 2021 to January 2022.

Exposures

Dominant presentation, clinical features, and diagnostic tests associated with CJD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and prognostic value of clinical features and accessible diagnostic tests at presentation with possible CJD.

Results

A total of 115 patients were identified, including 40 patients (35%) with definite CJD. Mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 64.8 (9.4) years, and 68 patients were women (59%). The sensitivity of clinical markers (myoclonus) and tests historically considered in patients with suspected CJD was poor (eg, stereotyped electroencephalography anomalies: 17 of 105 patients [16%]; elevated CSF protein 14–3–3 levels: 54 of 90 patients [60%]). By comparison, biomarkers with good diagnostic sensitivity at presentation included RT-QuIC (66 of 71 patients [93%]), CSF total tau (T-tau) level greater than 1149 pg/mL (81 of 92 patients [88%]), and characteristic signal anomalies on magnetic resonance imaging (88 of 115 patients [77%]). Multivariable linear regression confirmed shorter survival in patients with myoclonus (difference, -125.9 [95% CI, -236.3 to -15.5] days; p = 0.03), visual or cerebellar signs (difference, -180.2 [95% CI, -282.2 to -78.2] days; P < .001), elevated CSF protein 14–3–3 levels (difference, -193 [95% CI, -304.9 to -82.9] days; P < .001), and elevated T-tau level (difference for every 1000 pg/mL elevation, -9.1 [95% CI, -17.7 to -1.0] days; p = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that CSF RT-QuIC, elevated CSF T-tau level, and stereotyped magnetic resonance imaging anomalies were associated with the diagnosis of CJD, while other clinical findings (eg, myoclonus), stereotyped electroencephalography anomalies, and CSF protein 14–3–3 levels offered less diagnostic value. Visual or cerebellar features, myoclonus, and CSF 14–3–3 and T-tau levels may be associated with disease duration, justifying continued inclusion in the evaluation of patients suspected to have CJD.

### Clinical update of jakob-creutzfeldt disease [^111uPYE6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review discusses recent clinical data on diagnosis, new forms, and treatment of human prion diseases, and briefly summarizes research suggesting prion-like mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent Findings

When proper sequences are performed, MRI has high diagnostic utility in prion disease, but there are issues with interpretation of images. The spectrum of MRI's utility for diagnosis and understanding human prion disease is still being explored. Two recent diffusion tensor imaging studies quantified changes in the gray and white matter in sporadic Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, with unexpected results. The diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers has been controversial. A few studies showed that amplification methods can detect prions in either cerebrospinal fluid, olfactory epithelium, blood and/or urine in various human prion diseases. Additional cases of variably protease-sensitive prionopathy have led to a broader understanding of this novel sporadic prion disease. A few new mutations causing genetic prion disease, one with a very atypical presentation, have been identified. Although recent human prion disease treatment trials did not show benefit, they have improved our understanding, and led to better quantification, of the progression of these disorders. Lastly, we briefly summarize the increasing evidence that many nonprion neurodegenerative proteinopathies might spread in the brain by a prion-like mechanism.

Summary

New prion detection methods appear promising, but need to be replicated with larger sample sizes. Identification of novel forms of human prion disease might better elucidate the full spectrum of prion diseases and expand our understanding of their pathogenesis.

### Systematic approach to diagnosing suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^116DaPnx]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Evaluation of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is usually challenging. In most cases, patients progress to dementia in weeks to months, and the differential diagnosis is broad. In this case, a woman in her 60s presented with a 1-month history of episodic vertigo, cognitive decline, ataxia and myoclonus. Cerebrospinal fluid total tau was markedly elevated, which was helpful in establishing the diagnosis and discussing prognosis/end-of-life measures with the patient's family. This case summarises a stepwise diagnostic approach for patients with RPD and highlights recent literature on biomarkers of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and autoimmune encephalitis.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1122S3zs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

A major benefit of rapid and accurate in-life diagnosis is the potential for recruitment to therapeutic trials; challenges to recruitment include short survival, diagnostic latency, and rarity of CJD. Our results demonstrate that the diagnosis can be made with high confidence during life. A 2020 studyexplored noninvasive PrP Sc subtyping using MRI to enable targeted trials. While our data support the consensus that MRI patterns correlate to strain subtypes, we did not evaluate the potential for MRI subtyping during life, and further work is necessary.

A total of 5 cases were not classified as probable sCJD by revised criteria when fully investigated; 4 were classified as unclear. The criteria do not classify individuals with insufficient clinical features, including those with a positive investigation (except RT-QuIC). This gap in criteria coverage poses challenges. In some individuals, sCJD likelihood is high, and a working diagnosis may be made, with follow-up demonstrating progression, allowing reclassification. sCJD is clinically heterogeneous, and some individuals may not satisfy criteria, for example cognitively spared individuals with ataxic onset. RT-QuIC has utility in such individuals, evidenced by the 40 cases reclassified from unclear to probable. Similarly, clinical features may evolve with disease progression. We recommend serial evaluation in individuals with unclear diagnoses. We propose the novel classification category "clinically limited sCJD" for individuals with limited clinical features and a supportive investigation (except RT-QuIC).

### Sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease in the young (50 and below): 10-year review of United Kingdom surveillance [^115mQfoV]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study complements the existing literature by providing a coherent narrative of the clinical, investigation and neuropathological characteristics of young-onset sCJD from a large national surveillance cohort. Our findings have important "real-world" clinical implications for early-onset cognitive services and prion disease surveillance programmes worldwide, informing early and accurate diagnosis of sCJD in young individuals. Considerations should be taken to exclude other prion disease subtypes, which continue to have significant public health implications worldwide. Improvements in the diagnosis of this group will aid effective care planning and support recruitment to future clinical trials in human prion disease.

### Creutzfeldt-jakob disease: an emergency department presentation of a rare disease [^116J3tpz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is one of a group of neurodegenerative disorders causing spongiform encephalopathies. CJD is the most common human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or prion disease, but has an annual incidence of only 0.4–1.8 cases per million population worldwide. The prognosis for this disease is very poor and there is currently no cure. Patients typically present with non-specific neurological or psychiatric complaints and often have multiple physician visits before diagnosis, which requires histological examination of brain tissue. This patient had serial presentations to our Emergency Department, with progressive symptoms and multiple laboratory and radiological tests as well as consults, but her diagnosis remained unclear until her disease rapidly progressed and a brain biopsy was performed. With increasing concerns about prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-or mad cow disease-and CJD, awareness of the symptoms and diagnostic challenges associated with these diseases will be helpful to emergency physicians.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^115da2EQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an invariably fatal but rare infectious spongiform encephalopathy secondary to infectious prion protein. The annual incidence rate is known to be approximately 1–2 per million worldwide.CJD is classified according to its aetiology into four subtypes of sporadic, familial, iatrogenic and variant forms. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) occurs when normal prion protein PrPc spontaneously convert into infectious form PrPSc through an unknown process. It consists of up to 85%–90% of all the CJD cases, and its mean age of onset is known to be at 65 year. Most patients will pass away due to infection or cardiorespiratory failure within 12 months of disease onset, and both genders seem to be equally affected. Familial CJD is autosomal dominant, and this form is secondary to the mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP, also known as CD230) on the short arm of chromosome 20. It consists of 5%–10% of the total CJD cases and is known to be correlated with a relatively early onset of age (40–50 years). Its disease duration can be up to 24 months, which is relatively longer than those of other subtypes. Variant CJD (< 1%), which is reported since the middle of the 90s and associated with ingestion of meat products infected with prion, leads to cerebral prion plaques rather than spongiform alteration in the brain. Iatrogenic CJD (< 1%) is an acquired form of CJD secondary to transmission from an established source; previous human pituitary hormone injection, use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments, dural graft transplant or corneal transplant have been attributed.sCJD can present with rapid cognitive and functional decline, memory deficit, myoclonus, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs and visual deficits. These typical clinical features are well summarised in the WHO and MRI-CJD Consortium diagnostic criteria, which provide an invaluable diagnostic guideline to any physicians unfamiliar with the disease. However, even those clinical signs mentioned on the guidelines are non-specific and can also manifest in other neurological differential diagnoses of rapidly progressive dementia. Given the rare incidence and non-specific clinical features of CJD, it is not uncommon for it to be missed as a potential diagnosis. Furthermore, sCJD can present with atypical clinical features outside the guidelines, thereby posing a significant diagnostic dilemma. Hence, in addition to a detailed clinical history and examination, early use of appropriate investigations involving MRI, EEG, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is crucial in excluding other differentials and at the same time, confirming probable sCJD. Here, we discuss a highly unusual case of a rapidly progressing sCJD characterised by an extremely short duration of disease of < 5 weeks. Despite the initial presenting clinical features of rapid cognitive decline, aphasia, ataxia and visual disturbances, which are typical of sCJD, the patient was initially worked up for stroke given the acuteness of his disease onset. Nevertheless, additional investigations with MRI, EEG and CSF study allowed for prompt diagnosis of probable CJD, with postmortem brain autopsy confirming definitive sCJD.

### Diagnosing variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease: a retrospective analysis of the first 150 cases in the UK [^116mM5jh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Establishing an early clinical diagnosis in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) can be difficult, resulting in extended periods of uncertainty for many families and sometimes a view that patients have been subjected to unnecessary investigations. This issue is accentuated by the progressive nature of vCJD and by the difficulty in achieving a confident clinical diagnosis before an advanced stage of illness. Although diagnostic delay may be a result of the non-specific early clinical features, a systematic analysis of the process of diagnosis was undertaken, with the aim of trying to achieve earlier diagnosis of vCJD.

Methods

Retrospective case file analysis was undertaken of the first 150 definite and clinically probable cases of vCJD identified by the UK surveillance system.

Results

There is a significant interval between illness onset and presentation to a primary care physician, which is influenced by the nature of the initial clinical features. Neurological review is invariably sought following the development of clinical signs and a diagnosis is then established relatively quickly. Despite the progressive clinical course, a confident clinical diagnosis is not usually achieved until a relatively advanced stage of illness (mean time to diagnosis 10.5 months) with a more rapid clinical progression accounting for those cases diagnosed earlier after symptom onset.

Conclusions

Early clinical diagnosis in vCJD is not possible in the great majority of cases because of non-specific initial symptoms. Once neurological signs develop, a diagnosis is usually made promptly but this is often at a relatively advanced stage of illness. The inherent delays in the diagnosis of vCJD have implications for those involved in both public health and therapeutics.

### Creutzfeldt-jakob disease: a systematic review of global incidence, prevalence, infectivity, and incubation [^1133qL6j]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal disease presenting with rapidly progressive dementia, and most patients die within a year of clinical onset. CJD poses a potential risk of iatrogenic transmission, as it can incubate asymptomatically in humans for decades before becoming clinically apparent. In this Review, we sought evidence to understand the current iatrogenic risk of CJD to public health by examining global evidence on all forms of CJD, including clinical incidence and prevalence of subclinical disease. We found that although CJD, particularly iatrogenic CJD, is rare, the incidence of sporadic CJD is increasing. Incubation periods as long as 40 years have been observed, and all genotypes have now been shown to be susceptible to CJD. Clinicians and surveillance programmes should maintain awareness of CJD to mitigate future incidences of its transmission. Awareness is particularly relevant for sporadic CJD, which occurs in older people in whom clinical presentation could resemble rapidly developing dementia.

### The importance of ongoing international surveillance for creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^113kFA8c]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative disease associated with the accumulation of misfolded prion protein in the CNS. International CJD surveillance programmes have been active since the emergence, in the mid-1990s, of variant CJD (vCJD), a disease linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Control measures have now successfully contained bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the incidence of vCJD has declined, leading to questions about the requirement for ongoing surveillance. However, several lines of evidence have raised concerns that further cases of vCJD could emerge as a result of prolonged incubation and/or secondary transmission. Emerging evidence from peripheral tissue distribution studies employing high-sensitivity assays suggests that all forms of human prion disease carry a theoretical risk of iatrogenic transmission. Finally, emerging diseases, such as chronic wasting disease and camel prion disease, pose further risks to public health. In this Review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the transmission of prion diseases in human populations and argue that CJD surveillance remains vital both from a public health perspective and to support essential research into disease pathophysiology, enhanced diagnostic tests and much-needed treatments.

### Human prion diseases: progress in clinical trials [^114hXH7k]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

The progress made in understanding disease pathology and phenomenology in prion disorders and recent advances in diagnostic techniques might encourage researchers now to consider therapeutic trials in patients with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Although attempts have been made in the past, the drugs tested involved a variety of compounds that belong to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory or analgesic substance classes and most of the studies are limited to extremely small series or single case reports. Controlled trials are rare but progress in diagnostic techniques, such as imaging, CSF biomarkers and recently developed methods to detect abnormal prion protein in easily accessible body fluids, will hopefully lead to early diagnosis of the disease. Although clinical trials are difficult to perform, they are feasible and clinicians must contemplate several specific problems when evaluating the efficacy of a drug in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is the most common human prion disease form, but still rare, with an annual incidence range between one and two cases per million per year worldwide. Any potential benefit of a drug must be proven on a large number of patients. Low disease incidence and prevalence are therefore problematic in terms of sample size. The median disease duration reported for all forms of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is ∼6 months. The disease duration varies, and major determinants of survival such as age at onset, gender and PRNP codon 129 genotype have been identified. Unlike more chronic neurological disorders, prolonging survival from time of diagnosis offers one obvious and tractable outcome for a clinical trial. However, because of rapid disease progression, the clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is frequently not made until middle and late disease stages.

### Validation of diagnostic criteria for variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1125N2nx]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a novel form of human prion disease, was recognized in 1996. The disease affected a younger cohort than sporadic CJD, and the early clinical course was dominated by psychiatric and sensory symptoms. In an attempt to aid diagnosis and establish standardization between surveillance networks, diagnostic criteria were established. These were devised from the features of a small number of cases and modified in 2000 as the clinical phenotype was established. Since then, only minor changes have been introduced; revalidation of the criteria in the current format is overdue.

Methods

Included in this study are autopsy/cerebral biopsy-proven cases of vCJD referred to the National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) between 1995 and 2004 and suspect cases in which an alternative diagnosis was identified following autopsy/cerebral biopsy.

Results

Over the 10-year period, 106 definite cases of vCJD and 45 pathologically confirmed "noncases" were identified from the archives of the NCJDSU. The median age at onset of the cases was significantly younger than that of the noncases (27 years [range, 12–74 years] vs 43 years [range, 10–64 years]), and the median duration of illness was significantly shorter (14 months [range, 6–39 months] vs 22 months [range, 2–139 months]). The most commonly identified core clinical feature in cases was dementia; persistent painful sensory symptoms were the least frequent. Eighty-eight of 106 (83%) vCJD cases were retrospectively classified as probable in life, 6 cases were classified as possible. Most cases were classified as probable on the basis of core clinical features and brain magnetic resonance imaging. To date, the diagnostic criteria remain 100% specific, with no autopsy/cerebral biopsy-proven noncases classified as probable in life.

Interpretation

This study confirms that the diagnostic criteria for vCJD are sensitive and specific and provide a useful standard framework for case classification in a surveillance setting.

### Updated clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^114Vgrjs]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sporadic CJD (sCJD) is a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder with a fatal outcome. Clinical diagnostic criteria for sCJD were first formulated 30 years ago, using a combination of distinctive clinical features and best available auxiliary paraclinical investigations, which at that time was electroencephalography (EEG) (Masters et al.). In recent years, there has been progress in developing other specialist investigations, including useful surrogate biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and clinical diagnostic criteria have been amended (Zerr et al; Collins et al.).

A series of recent publications has dealt with the clinical and pathological phenotypes and heterogeneity in sCJD (Parchi et al; Gambetti et al; Castellani et al; Collins et al; Sanchez-Juan et al.). It has become apparent that a multimodal approach may be necessary if detection of the entire phenotypic spectrum of sCJD is to be achieved (Zerr et al.). Whereas some classical molecular subtypes such as the MM1 subtype frequently display periodic sharp and slow wave complexes in the EEG, the other five molecular subtypes are negative with this investigation (Parchi et al; Castellani et al; Collins et al.). Utilizing CSF 14–3–3 protein detection provides a higher sensitivity, including less typical subtypes of sCJD such as VV1 and VV2 subtypes (Collins et al; Sanchez-Juan et al; Geschwind et al.). However, even for CSF 14–3–3 protein detection with an overall sensitivity of 85%–95%, biological variables modify the test results and cases with longer duration or younger age at onset may be missed by this investigation (Castellani et al; Sanchez-Juan et al.).

### Prospects for the development of pre-mortem laboratory diagnostic tests for creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^116ebapS]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

At present the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in humans is based on clinical criteria and (at post-mortem) the histopathological and immunological examination of brain tissue. The misfolded prion protein, PrPSc, is the single most significant marker, but its recognition by standard serological methods is complicated by its antigenic similarity to the normal prion protein, PrPC. Although there are commercial diagnostic assays available for bovine spongiform encephalopathy using brain specimens taken at slaughter, there are no suitable pre-mortem assays for cattle and none either for pre-mortem human disease. Especially in view of the recent report of variant CJD transmission by blood transfusion, it is important that tests for pre-symptomatic infections are developed. This will safeguard the blood supply and, for example, prevent the transmission of CJD in neurosurgery. This paper reviews the current and prospective approaches to the pre-mortem diagnosis of CJD, in particular its variant form.

### Imaging of creutzfeldt-jakob disease: imaging patterns and their differential diagnosis [^113FUTY6]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) remains a challenge because of the large variability of the clinical scenario, especially in its early stages, which may mimic several reversible or treatable disorders. The molecular basis of prion disease, as well as its brain propagation and the pathogenesis of the illness, have become better understood in recent decades. Several reports have listed recognizable clinical features and paraclinical tests to supplement the replicable diagnostic criteria in vivo. Nevertheless, we lack specific data about the differential diagnosis of CJD at imaging, mainly regarding those disorders evolving with similar clinical features (mimicking disorders). This review provides an update on the neuroimaging patterns of sCJD, emphasizing the relevance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, summarizing the clinical scenario and molecular basis of the disease, and highlighting clinical, genetic, and imaging correlations in different subtypes of prion diseases. A long list of differential diagnoses produces a comprehensive pictorial review, with the aim of enabling radiologists to identify typical and atypical patterns of sCJD. This review reinforces distinguishable imaging findings and confirms diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) features as pivotal in the diagnostic workup of sCJD, as these findings enable radiologists to reliably recognize this rare but invariably lethal disease. A probable diagnosis is justified when expected MR imaging patterns are demonstrated and CJD-mimicking disorders are confidently ruled out. © RSNA, 2017.

### Recent US case of variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease-global implications [^116CzVUu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare, fatal prion disease resulting from transmission to humans of the infectious agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. We describe the clinical presentation of a recent case of vCJD in the United States and provide an update on diagnostic testing. The location of this patient's exposure is less clear than those in the 3 previously reported US cases, but strong evidence indicates that exposure to contaminated beef occurred outside the United States more than a decade before illness onset. This case exemplifies the persistent risk for vCJD acquired in unsuspected geographic locations and highlights the need for continued global surveillance and awareness to prevent further dissemination of vCJD.

### Clinical features of variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1114b2r3]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Since 1996, over one hundred cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have appeared, mostly in the United Kingdom. In this review, we summarise the major clinical features of this progressive neurodegenerative condition and compare them with those of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We emphasise the young age (median 26 years) at presentation and the dominant psychiatric/behavioural features, particularly depression. Sensory symptoms are present initially in half the cases and florid psychiatric symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, are also common. Given these symptoms, many patients present in clinical practice initially to a psychiatrist but are referred to neurologists when neurological signs become apparent. Although the definitive diagnosis remains neuropathological, a confident pre-mortem diagnosis is now possible when the 'pulvinar sign' is seen on magnetic resonance imaging studies.

### Constant transmission properties of variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease in 5 countries [^1175Lofs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The similarities in lesion profiles, biochemistry, and immunohistochemistry between this series of vCJD transmission studies support the hypothesis that a single strain of infectious agent is responsible for all vCJD cases, regardless of geographic origin, which would suggest that current diagnostic criteria for vCJD are sufficient to detect cases in all countries at this time. Still to be determined is whether the differences in incubation period rankings in some cases represent changes in strain phenotype over time, which could affect future diagnosis.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^115HCq8S]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large multinational clinicopathological evaluation of the 2017 International CJD Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria for sCJD, investigating a 3-year cohort of all neuropathologically confirmed sCJD cases from 4 national centers. Our study complements earlier observations, quantifying criteria performance and evaluating how criteria revisions may affect in-life case ascertainment. The revised criteria were 92.2% sensitive for probable sCJD diagnosis, rising to 97.8% when all investigations were performed, which resulted in a 21.5% improvement in antemortem case ascertainment compared with prior criteria. This improvement offers major utility for surveillance programs and clinicians.

We evaluated cases with full and partial investigation workup, reflecting the real-world limitations of surveillance. Reasons patients may not undergo all investigations include intolerance or contraindications to MRI or lumbar punctureand limitations to biomarker testing. Furthermore, after one positive investigation the diagnosis may be evident, thus making additional investigations unnecessary. Notably, the revised criteria demonstrated lower specificity than was reported (99%) in a previous single-center studyin which noncases with evidence supporting alternative diagnoses were not classified as probable sCJD, regardless of positive sCJD-related investigations. Nonetheless, the reported sensitivity was similar (97%). We encourage full investigation where possible to maximize sensitivity, but emphasize the importance of considering alternative etiologies and investigating accordingly.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^115u3gpw]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

CJD is a rare and untreatable disease, which has an annual incidence of 1–2 per million worldwide.CJD can be divided into sporadic, familial, iatrogenic and variant forms. In our case, the patient had sCJD.

Our case demonstrated the importance of early consideration of CJD as a potential diagnosis for rapidly progressive dementia. The case was diagnosed, as per WHO and MRI-CJD Consortium diagnostic criteria, as a probable sCJD during the antemortem stage based on the clinical findings, positive MRI and CSF analysis. Diagnosis of CJD can be challenging. Its common clinical features are non-specific and can be present in other differential neurodegenerative diseases. Atypical clinical features not fulfilling diagnostic criteria and the absence of any significant findings in EEG and MRI may further hamper a diagnosis of CJD. Therefore, it is not uncommon for CJD to be missed or diagnosed late, and its clinical presentations can be wrongly attributed to other more common differential diagnoses. In other cases, physicians may even request for highly invasive antemortem brain biopsy as they may be unsure of readily available, non-invasive diagnostic tests.

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^116aqPyf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that CSF RT-QuIC, elevated T-tau level, and stereotyped MRI anomalies continue to support the diagnosis of CJD in the modern era, while other clinical findings (eg, myoclonus) and biomarkers traditionally ascribed to CJD (eg, periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG, CSF protein 14–3–3 level) offer less diagnostic value owing to high false negative potential. Detection of visual or cerebellar features, myoclonus, and CSF protein 14–3–3 and T-tau levels may be associated with disease duration, justifying inclusion in the evaluation of patients with suspected CJD. Comprehensive evaluation incorporating multiple diagnostic biomarkers is important to optimize diagnosis and inform survival in patients with CJD.

### Human prion diseases [^115rdYoX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prion diseases are rapidly progressive neurodegenerative conditions that can be difficult to diagnose and are transmissible under specific circumstances. The authors will provide background regarding prion disease and focus on diagnostic tools.

Recent Findings

Prion disease is caused by misfolded prion protein. The three possible causes of prion disease include sporadic (85%), genetic (10–15%), and acquired (< 1%). Acquired prion diseases include kuru, iatrogenic, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Prion diseases differ in their clinical manifestation, neuropathology, and diagnostic test results. A variety of recent diagnostic tools have evolved that allow more reliable antemortem diagnosis of prion disease such as brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion. Special infectivity guidelines must be followed when dealing with central nervous system tissue, but only standard precautions are needed for routine clinical care of patients with prion disease.

Summary

The only way to definitely diagnose prion disease and determine its type is via neuropathologic examination. However, brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion have drastically increased diagnostic accuracy and are important tests to use when evaluating patients with suspected prion disease.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^112JZKtk]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Antemortem assessment of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) can be significantly hampered due to its rarity, low index of clinical suspicion and its non-specific clinical features. We present an atypical case of definitive sCJD. The patient died within 5 weeks of the disease onset. This unusually short duration of disease presented a significant diagnostic dilemma. The patient presented with 2-week history of sudden-onset cognitive decline, memory loss, aphasia and ataxia. MRI Diffusion-weighted sequences revealed cortical ribboning sign without cerebral atrophy. Protein 14–3–3 from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was detected, and postmortem brain autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of sCJD. This case underscores the importance of considering CJD as a potential diagnosis for rapidly progressive dementia. Serology tests, EEG, MRI and CSF study are invaluable diagnostic tools when assessing for sCJD. Appropriate use of those diagnostic tests, along with a detailed clinical examination, can successfully and promptly exclude other differential diagnoses and confirm sCJD.

### An atypical case of creutzfeldt-jakob disease mimicking frontotemporal dementia: genotypic influence and clinical implications [^113H3r1F]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD) is a rapid progressive dementia related to the conversion of the prion protein (PrPC) into a misfolded form (PrPSc) which accumulates in neuronal cells leading to intracellular spongiform changes and neuronal loss. Clinical presentation in CJD is extremely heterogeneous mimicking other diseases, MRI and RT-QuiC approved in the current criteria have improved the diagnostic efficiency. We present a case worth reporting for its atypical presentation, mimicking frontotemporal dementia instead of classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

### Human prion diseases: progress in clinical trials [^113ksmBn]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

There is a wide scope of clinical phenomenology in human prion disease with respect to presenting features, rate of progression and appearance of other clinical manifestation. Phenotypic variability in the clinical syndrome and neuropathological changes in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were recognized long ago and some attempts have been made to define disease subtypes based on a molecular disease classification. But as with many neurological disorders, heterogeneity of the clinical and pathological phenotype may reduce power even if an adequate sample can be recruited for a particular study.

Taking these considerations into account, clinicians face important decisions when designing a trial to assess efficacy and safety in the context of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Scales have been designed to monitor disease progression in Alzheimer's disease; and for vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. Unfortunately, these systems are not suitable for monitoring cognitive decline in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease because of the different neuropsychological profiles. Also, neurological abnormalities such as ataxia, rigidity or myoclonus need to be monitored in a standard way. Because of the variability in clinical syndromes across molecular Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease subtypes, specific scales, weighted for particular subtypes, would be needed. Anticipating this issue, trial protocols need to include a variety of rating scales designed to probe neurological, cognitive, psychiatric and general functional status.

The paper by Andrew Thompson and colleagues in the current issue of Brain directly addresses these issues. The goal was to develop a rating scale for the progression of symptoms in prion diseases (the MRC Prion Disease Rating Scale) that could be used as an outcome measure in future clinical trials, as no single scale has been able to capture progression across the full range of functional domains affected in patients with prion diseases. The analysis was performed on data obtained from 437 clinical trial participants over a period of several years. Scale development included semi-quantitative and qualitative carer interviews, item response modelling, inter-rater reliability testing, construct analysis and correlation with several existing scales. The proposed 20-point MRC Prion Disease Rating Scale assesses domains of cognitive function, speech, mobility, personal care/feeding and continence. An important point is that the items are weighted according to their relative importance documented by interview with carers. Another advantage is easy application; the scale can be used over the telephone and will allow frequent assessments, which are necessary because of the rapid progression of the disease.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1117dduD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Disease Duration and Age

The previous diagnostic criteria were most sensitive in cases with short (43 of 52 [82.7%; 95% CI, 69.7%-91.8%]) and typical (91 of 110 [82.7%; 95% CI, 74.4%-89.3%]) duration compared with those with prolonged duration (32 of 56 [57.1%; 95% CI, 43.2%-70.3%]) (P = 0.001) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). No group differences were observed with revised criteria. There were no differences in sensitivity of MRI, except in cases with isolated basal ganglia hyperintensity, which occurred most often in cases with prolonged duration (28 of 115 [24.4%; 95% CI, 16.8%-33.2%]), followed by typical (45 of 223 [20.2%; 95% CI, 15.1%-26.1%]) and short duration (11 of 106 [10.4%; 95% CI, 5.3%-17.8%]) (P = 0.02). RT-QuIC was most sensitive in cases with typical duration (126 of 131 [96.2%; 95% CI, 91.3%-98.7%]), followed by cases with prolonged (59 of 67 [88.1%; 95% CI, 77.8%-94.7%]) and short (59 of 68 [86.8%; 95% CI, 76.4%-93.8%]) duration (P = 0.03). Results of assessments of diagnostic criteria and investigation sensitivities between age groups are detailed in eTable 5 in the Supplement.

### Updated clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^114V2szn]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Acknowledging the limitations of the clinical criteria, the search for additional sCJD diagnostic investigations has continued. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in the clinical diagnosis of sCJD. The use of sensitive fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weight imaging (DWI) sequences allows the detection of basal ganglia hyperintensity and signal increase in other brain regions (Satoh et al; Tschampa et al; Fujita et al; Galanaud et al; Meissner et al.). Characteristic MRI lesion patterns corresponding to individual CJD subtypes have been reported (Meissner et al.). As MRI findings, even from early in the illness, are proving valuable in the evaluation of suspected sCJD patients, both by excluding other disorders and by demonstrating features considered typical of human prion disease (Geschwind et al.), we undertook a systematic multi-centre international collaborative study to analyse the value of MRI lesion patterns in comparison to CSF biomarker 14–3–3 and periodic sharp wave complexes in the EEG in terms of test sensitivity and specificity.

### Updated clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1128sUuz]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

The time point at which the clinical diagnosis of sCJD is made may be very important if treatment strategies become available as any therapy will probably need to be started early if it is to be effective. The EEG has been shown to become positive usually only in the late stages of the disease. CSF biomarkers can become positive in the early disease stages, as shown in a cohort of patients with repeated lumbar punctures and multiple CSF tests (Sanchez-Juan et al.). With MRI the question on when the typical changes appear is still unresolved because of the limited number of patients with multiple scans. However, there is a suggestion from the literature that MRI may become positive early in the disease (Young et al; Fujita et al; Galanaud et al; Hoshino et al.). Further work will be needed to address this question.

In summary, our data show that basal ganglia and cortical hyperintensities represent the most frequent MRI findings in sCJD and are present in most cases. Characteristic brain MRI lesion patterns are helpful in establishing a diagnosis of sCJD and may help to identify atypical sporadic disease forms. This is the most comprehensive study on MRI findings in sCJD to date, and in combination with previous studies, provides firm evidence that brain MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of the disease.

### Advanced tests for early and accurate diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^111mqE34]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a necessary to distinguish this untreatable disease from treatable rapidly progressive dementias, and to prevent iatrogenic transmission. Currently, definitive diagnosis of CJD requires detection of the abnormally folded, CJD-specific form of protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(CJD)) in brain tissue obtained postmortem or via biopsy; therefore, diagnosis of sporadic CJD in clinical practice is often challenging. Supporting investigations, including MRI, EEG and conventional analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, are helpful in the diagnostic work-up, but do not allow definitive diagnosis. Recently, novel ultrasensitive seeding assays, based on the amplified detection of PrP(CJD), have improved the diagnostic process; for example, real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is a sensitive method to detect prion-seeding activity in brain homogenate from humans with any subtype of sporadic CJD. RT-QuIC can also be used for in vivo diagnosis of CJD: its diagnostic sensitivity in detecting PrP(CJD) in CSF samples is 96%, and its specificity is 100%. Recently, we provided evidence that RT-QuIC of olfactory mucosa brushings is a 97% sensitive and 100% specific for sporadic CJD. These assays provide a basis for definitive antemortem diagnosis of prion diseases and, in doing so, improve prospects for reducing the risk of prion transmission. Moreover, they can be used to evaluate outcome measures in therapeutic trials for these as yet untreatable infections.

### Updated clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^114ek7Gi]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Several molecular subtypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease have been identified and electroencephalogram and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have been reported to support clinical diagnosis but with variable utility according to subtype. In recent years, a series of publications have demonstrated a potentially important role for magnetic resonance imaging in the pre-mortem diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Magnetic resonance imaging signal alterations correlate with distinct sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease molecular subtypes and thus might contribute to the earlier identification of the whole spectrum of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases. This multi-centre international study aimed to provide a rationale for the amendment of the clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging were recruited from 12 countries. Patients referred as 'suspected sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease' but with an alternative diagnosis after thorough follow up, were analysed as controls. All magnetic resonance imaging scans were assessed for signal changes according to a standard protocol encompassing seven cortical regions, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated in 436 sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease patients and 141 controls. The pattern of high signal intensity with the best sensitivity and specificity in the differential diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease was identified. The optimum diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of rapid progressive dementia was obtained when either at least two cortical regions (temporal, parietal or occipital) or both caudate nucleus and putamen displayed a high signal in fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging magnetic resonance imaging. Based on our analyses, magnetic resonance imaging was positive in 83% of cases. In all definite cases, the amended criteria would cover the vast majority of suspected cases, being positive in 98%. Cerebral cortical signal increase and high signal in caudate nucleus and putamen on fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging magnetic resonance imaging are useful in the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. We propose an amendment to the clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease to include findings from magnetic resonance imaging scans.

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^111VJWBX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Beyond informing diagnoses, biomarkers may have prognostic implications. Indeed, elevations in CSF T-tau and protein 14–3–3 levels were independently associated with time from testing to death in this series. T-tau and CSF protein 14–3–3 levels are presumed to reflect rapid neuronal damage, providing a logical mechanism underpinning this relationship in CJD, and justifying continued measurement of CSF protein 14–3–3 levels in clinical cohorts with suspected CJD.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. The study was performed at tertiary care centers, using retrospective data. Under this rubric, selected CJD cases could have been missed or misdiagnosed at our center, or selected tests results (eg, MRI findings) could have been misinterpreted. The use of RT-QuIC results as a diagnostic criterion for probable CJD may have led to unintentional exclusion of patients and overestimation of the sensitivity of RT-QuIC for the diagnosis of CJD. Collectively, these limitations may have affected our estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity of clinical features and tests. We must also acknowledge that we intentionally focused on variables that informed diagnostic criteria to the exclusion of others. Thus, our results do not inform optimal testing for diagnosis and prognosis in CJD, but rather the use of accessible clinical features and biomarkers. These factors limit generalizability of our study results and necessitate replication in other populations. While we focused on initial presentation, it is also important to acknowledge that detection of these biomarkers might increase throughout the disease course, as seen in individuals who underwent repeat MRIs. Prospective studies, including standardized clinical assessments with longitudinal measurement of established and emergent clinical features and biomarkers (eg, neurofilament light chain, phosphorylated tau,), are needed to further inform the care of patients with CJD.

### Methods to minimize the risks of creutzfeldt-jakob disease transmission by surgical procedures: where to set the standard? [^1153PKQo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

New prion-related disorders have emerged over the past 20 years, of which the most notable in the human context is variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). This disorder is a challenge to medical and public health professionals seeking early detection and diagnosis, provision of therapy, and support for persons affected and a better understanding of transmission risks. The risk of iatrogenic transmission of the disease remains a significant threat, given the well documented cases of CJD transmission via surgery, organ transplantation, and blood transfusion. This review discusses our current understanding of the prevalence of variant CJD, the distribution of tissue infectivity, and new methods for the decontamination of surgical instruments. A comparison of emerging technologies is provided on the basis of our current perception of surgical risk to identify methods that are likely to provide sufficient safety margins and to stimulate debate about the standards needed to protect against variant CJD and CJD transmission.

The clinical phenotype of CJD is more tightly linked to its expected CJD pathology.

### Rapidly progressive young-onset dementias: neuropsychiatric aspects [^115gQdCX]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is roughly defined as neurocognitive decline resulting in dementia or death within 2 years. Although RPDs affect all age groups, many occur in patients with young-onset dementia. Although prion disease (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is often thought to be the prototypic rapidly progressive young-onset dementia, the differential diagnosis is broad and some etiologies may be treatable. Hence, an appropriate workup to determine the etiology of RPD is crucial to planning the appropriate management. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, diagnostic workup, and management considerations for this unique patient population.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^117Wf61R]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is based on clinical syndrome and results of established paraclinical tests (EEG, CSF analysis and cranial MRI). The predominant clinical symptoms are characterized by rapid progressive dementia followed by development of neurological signs, e.g. ataxia and myoclonus. The disease is fatal and leads to death in a few months.

Detection of periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG substantiated the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease for a long period of time. From 1995 onwards, detection of neuronal destruction markers in CSF have become more and more important. They have been established in diagnostic work-up, with protein 14–3–3 as the most promising surrogate marker finally included in the WHO criteria. Because elevated levels of protein 14–3–3 are also reported in a range of non-prion-related diseases, mostly caused by an acute neurological event such as encephalitis, stroke, epileptic fit or tumour, positive results must be interpreted in the clinical context.

INTRODUCTION

Subacute encephalopathies, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), constitute a large and heterogeneous group of brain diseases that can be diagnostically challenging. Among these diseases, CJD has a special urgency, since this disease can be transmitted between individuals under some circumstances by an infection-like mechanism. Additional diagnostic difficulties arise due to the fact that the infectious agents are not conventional viruses or bacteria but rather are composed of a disease-associated, misfolded isoform (PrPd) of the host prion protein (PrPc). This key biological fact precludes the use of conventional technologies, such as PCR and serology, that are commonly applied to the direct detection of other infectious agents.

The diagnostic approach for the most common form of CJD, sporadic CJD, has to date relied upon a standardized clinical presentation and supporting investigations such as the presence of increased amounts of indirect protein markers of disease found in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The most commonly used markers are 14–3–3 protein, microtubule-associated protein tau, and S100 protein. These surrogate markers are not fully diagnostic due to the fact that they have variable sensitivities and are not specific for any form of CJD.

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^111Q9KRC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study considered the diagnostic performance of key clinical features and widely available tests in patients with CJD diagnosed following the advent of RT-QuIC testing. Although myoclonus and periodic discharges on EEG are historically associated with CJD, the diagnostic yield of these features was low in this cohort. By contrast, the diagnostic performance of CSF tests for CJD (RT-QuIC assays and T-tau level greater than 1149 pg/mL) and stereotyped signal anomalies on MRI was high, consistent with prior publications. Indeed, the combination of RT-QuIC, T-tau level greater than 1149 pg/mL, and stereotyped MRI findings identified all but 3 patients (97%) with CJD in this series. No differences in sensitivity of clinical features or diagnostic test results were observed between patients with definite vs probable diagnoses, further validating the diagnostic criteria for probable CJD. The detection of myoclonus or visual or cerebellar findings was associated with shorter disease duration, as were elevations of CSF protein 14–3–3 and T-tau levels, suggesting that these variables may inform disease prognosis. Collectively, these findings may guide prioritization and interpretation of accessible tests in patients with suspected CJD evaluated in the modern era.

### Diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging in variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^111rJuj1]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In essence, our study reveals that FLAIR imaging is superior to DWI in terms of identifying the pulvinar sign, while DWI tends to highlight hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and cortical areas more distinctly, creating image appearances more akin to sporadic CJD. Hence, it is crucial to approach DWI interpretation with caution when considering a diagnosis of vCJD.

In light of our research, we advocate an adjustment to the current diagnostic criteria for vCJD, emphasising the use of axial FLAIR imaging to accurately determine the presence or absence of the pulvinar sign. This shift could significantly enhance the diagnostic accuracy for vCJD, thereby deepening our understanding of its distinctive neuroimaging manifestations.

### Proposal of new diagnostic criteria for fatal familial insomnia [^112PiRSr]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human prion diseases are a group of fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorders with various manifestations caused by the presence of scrapie-like prion protein, and encompass Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS). FFI is an autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized by sleep-related, neuropsychiatric, and progressive sympathetic symptoms, with genetic analysis as a gold standard. However, clinically early recognition and diagnosis of FFI remains difficult because of the incomplete penetrance, high clinical heterogeneity, no specificity of auxiliary examinations, and overlapping clinical profile with other prion diseases such as CJD and GSS. In addition, FFI is quite rare, so the vast majority of neurologists have seen few or no cases. Thus, precise clinical diagnostic criteria are critical for an early recognition of FFI.

FFI was first identified in a 1986 post-mortem examination; however, the proposal of a clinical diagnostic pathway for FFI was delayed until 2014. In 2018, our institution published the clinical diagnostic criteria for FFI that were based on core clinical, suggestive and diagnostic features. The core clinical features are probable organic sleep-related symptoms, rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) and progressive sympathetic symptoms. However, as the criteria were based on examination of a limited number of cases, their applicability to the recognition of FFI and its differentiation from other types of prion disease is unclear. Validation in additional samples and revision is needed to improve their diagnostic power.

In this study, we established a task force composed of internationals experts experienced in prion diseases to update the FFI diagnostic criteria based on the 2018 FFI diagnostic criteria. A modified Delphi methods and web-based interactive conferences approach were used to suit the specific needs of this task force.

### Brain biopsy in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^113C3vYx]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with diagnostic criteria defined as a combination of clinical symptoms, electroencephalography findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and MR imaging results. Special subtypes are known to present with an atypical course and test findings that can complicate the clinical diagnosis. In such patients a brain biopsy can support the clinical approach.

Methods

The authors studied the records on 26 brain biopsies conducted in patients with suspected CJD who had been referred to the CJD Surveillance Unit in Germany between 1993 and 2005.

Results

Of the 26 included patients, 11 suffered from neuropathologically confirmed CJD, which in 5 cases had been deemed clinically "probable" and in 2 had been deemed "possible". The disease in the remaining 4 patients had been categorized as "other" prior to neuropathological confirmation of CJD. The results of 15 brain biopsies showed no features of prion disease. None of these 15 patients had received a probable diagnosis of CJD, 4 had a possible diagnosis, and 11 had received a diagnosis of "other". Three of the cases classified as other and none of those with CJD presented with pleocytosis in the CSF. In 73% of the other cases, biopsy sampling did not reveal any results characteristic of CJD but did not provide specific findings on which to base a differential diagnosis. Autopsy confirmed the biopsy diagnosis of CJD in all cases, and additionally confirmed that CJD was not present in 3 patients who had nondiagnostic biopsy results.

Conclusions

Biopsy sampling may be helpful in the diagnostic approach to rare cases of dementia for which a reliable diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of clinical symptoms, CSF parameters, electroencephalography, and MR imaging results.

### Radiological assessment of creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^115YsfRi]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare fatal neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and neurological signs. There is a need for early and accurate clinical diagnosis in order to exclude any treatable disorder. Additionally, it is of public interest to differentiate the sporadic form of the disease from the variant CJD type (vCJD), which is probably transmitted from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). High signal in the striatum on T2-weighted, FLAIR and diffusion weighted (DW) MRI as well as cortical high signal in FLAIR and DW MRI are the classical findings in sCJD. The "pulvinar sign", defined as high signal in the pulvinar thalami that is brighter than potential additional high signal in the basal ganglia, is considered pathognomonic for vCJD.

### MM2-type sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease: new diagnostic criteria for MM2-cortical type [^111bJBVD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To clinically diagnose MM2-cortical (MM2C) and MM2-thalamic (MM2T)-type sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) at early stage with high sensitivity and specificity.

Methods

We reviewed the results of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Surveillance Study in Japan between April 1999 and September 2019, which included 254 patients with pathologically confirmed prion diseases, including 9 with MM2C-type sCJD (MM2C-sCJD) and 10 with MM2T-type sCJD (MM2T-sCJD), and 607 with non-prion diseases.

Results

According to the conventional criteria of sCJD, 4 of 9 patients with MM2C- and 7 of 10 patients with MM2T-sCJD could not be diagnosed with probable sCJD until their death. Compared with other types of sCJD, patients with MM2C-sCJD showed slower progression of the disease and cortical distribution of hyperintensity lesions on diffusion-weighted images of brain MRI. Patients with MM2T-sCJD also showed relatively slow progression and negative results for most of currently established investigations for diagnosis of sCJD. To clinically diagnose MM2C-sCJD, we propose the new criteria; diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to distinguish 'probable' MM2C-sCJD from other subtypes of sCJD, genetic or acquired prion diseases and non-prion disease controls were 77.8% and 98.5%, respectively. As for MM2T-sCJD, clinical and laboratory features are not characterised enough to develop its diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

MM2C-sCJD can be diagnosed at earlier stage using the new criteria with high sensitivity and specificity, although it is still difficult to diagnose MM2T-sCJD clinically.

### Sporadic human prion diseases: molecular insights and diagnosis [^1116Nz6N]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Human prion diseases can be sporadic, inherited, or acquired by infection. Distinct clinical and pathological characteristics separate sporadic diseases into three phenotypes: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal insomnia, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. CJD accounts for more than 90% of all cases of sporadic prion disease; it is commonly categorised into five subtypes that can be distinguished according to leading clinical signs, histological lesions, and molecular traits of the pathogenic prion protein. Three subtypes affect prominently cognitive functions whereas the other two impair cerebellar motor activities. An accurate and timely diagnosis depends on careful clinical examination and early performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests, including electroencephalography, quantitative assessment of the surrogate markers 14–3–3, tau, and of the prion protein in the CSF, and neuroimaging. The reliability of CSF tests is improved when these tests are interpreted alongside neuroimaging data.

### CJD mimics and chameleons [^1162pmqM]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Rapidly progressive dementia mimicking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a relatively rare presentation but a rewarding one to become familiar with, as the potential diagnoses range from the universally fatal to the completely reversible. Patients require urgent decisions about assessment and investigation and have quickly evolving needs for treatments and support, through symptom management and end-of-life care in most cases. We have based this pragmatic review on the experiences of a specialist prion referral centre in the UK, which, unsurprisingly, is strongly biased towards seeing patients with CJD. Cases eventually proven not to have prion disease might be described as 'CJD-mimics'; being referred from UK neurologists, these are the most challenging cases. CJD in its classical presentation is very rarely mimicked; however, it is highly heterogeneous, and atypical forms can mimic virtually all common neurodegenerative syndromes. Warning features of a mimic include generalised seizures, hyponatraemia, fever, a facial movement disorder, a normal neurological examination and a modestly rapid presentation. Contrast-enhancing lesions or MRI signal hyperintensity outside the striatum, thalamus or cortex and a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis are key investigation pointers to a CJD mimic.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^116j39tM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include its comprehensive multinational cohort of all cases of autopsy-confirmed sCJD from surveillance centers in a 3-year period. All cases and noncases had neuropathological confirmation or exclusion of sCJD, minimizing misclassification and allowing clinicopathological correlation, especially for positive investigations in noncases. We expanded on previous work by quantifying performance of diagnostic criteria in cases grouped by c129, PrP Sc, disease duration, and age.

This study has several limitations. Excluding individuals without neuropathological examination may have introduced bias. A minority of sCJD patients undergo autopsy in the modern era; reasons include enhanced in-life diagnosis and declining autopsy service availability. Autopsied cases may overrepresent those for whom in-life diagnosis was not possible, reducing sensitivity. Noncases undergoing autopsy or biopsy are likewise a subgroup in surveillance; many do not undergo neuropathological examination and receive alternative diagnoses from clinical and investigation findings. Our sample may overrepresent noncases requiring autopsy, such as those with rapidly lethal illnesses or false positive investigations, which would lead to decreased specificity. Differences in methodology between centers may have been relevant, including a high proportion of German noncases with positive 14–3–3 assay. Availability of RT-QuIC and access to CJD specialist MRI reporting was not equivalent in all nations. Lastly, although our study explores internationally applied diagnostic criteria, it was centered in 4 large European nations. Additional analysis in other regions would be useful.

### Interpretable deep learning survival predictions in sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^115VGfh5]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) is the commonest human prion disease, with a worldwide annual incidence of 1–2 per million. Other aetiologies of human prion disease include inherited prion disease (IPD), iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), and variant CJD (vCJD) associated with dietary exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. Due to their status as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), human prion diseases including sCJD are the focus of international public health concern and disease surveillance.

sCJD is fatal and characterised by rapid disease progression, with median disease duration between 4 and 5 months. Key clinical features at presentation include rapidly progressive dementia, visual disturbance, neuropsychiatric disturbance and motor decline. Diagnosis can be established using the 2017 International CJD Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria. The adoption of this criteria, alongside advances in the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and real-time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC), has been shown to have significantly improved the diagnosis of sCJD.

Prognostication in sCJD

There is a significant degree of clinical heterogeneity in sCJD. Although most people diagnosed with sCJD are deceased 5 months from symptom onset, a significant portion have slower disease progression and survive beyond 12 months. Symptoms are also variable, with distinct clinical presentations reported including rapidly progressive dementia, neuropsychiatric onset, stroke-like presentations, and the Heidenhain subtype characterised by prominent visual disturbance.

Prognostication in sCJD therefore remains a significant challenge. Effective predictions of progression and survival will offer helpful information to healthcare professionals, families, carers and patients on the management of the illness and care planning. This is especially important given the introduction of evidence-based palliative care pathways in prion disease. Finally, as novel compounds enter investigations in prion disease clinical trials, effective survival prediction will facilitate stratification for trial inclusion and interpretation of survival benefit after interventions.

### Sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease in the young (50 and below): 10-year review of United Kingdom surveillance [^1125mh99]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inherited prion disease is also an important consideration in younger age groups. There is a high degree of heterogeneity in the clinical features, age of onset and disease duration of inherited prion disease, which may mimic sCJD. PRNP sequencing should be routinely pursued to exclude inherited prion diseases in the diagnosis of sCJD.

Although very rare, the iatrogenic transmission of CJD remains a significant public health concern worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and comprehensive surveillance for all types of CJD is important in maintaining vigilance for acquired or novel forms of prion disease.

Several non-prion neurological conditions are known to mimic the presentation of sCJD, a number of which are important and commoner considerations in younger individuals. Amongst the seven individuals identified, in common were marked clinical and radiological improvement after referral, in contrast with the commonly rapid and progressive disease course seen in CJD. These individuals also had non-supportive neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers, highlighting the utility of these investigations and comprehensive assessment in young individuals presenting with rapidly progressive cognitive, psychiatric, and motor dysfunction.

Care planning in young-onset sCJD

The UK NCJDRSU hosts the NHS England-funded National CJD Care Team, which provides post-diagnostic and longer-term support and guidance to people with sCJD and their families (M.L. T.H.). Our study findings are in keeping with our clinical experience of care coordination for younger individuals with sCJD. There are attendant complex and difficult care issues in this group; individuals are often of working age, with ongoing care responsibilities to family and dependents. The increased prevalence of psychiatric disturbance and personality changes often contributes to significant distress. The increased disease duration contributes to advanced care needs, with challenging gaps in services that are often bespoke to older people's social care and end-of-life provisions.

### Differential diagnosis of 201 possible creutzfeldt-jakob disease patients [^114JXL34]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Our objective was to describe the clinical signs of 'possible' Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and to investigate whether current diagnostic criteria can accurately differentiate between different forms of dementia. We studied clinical data of 'definite' CJD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and vascular dementia (VD) patients. Two subgroups were used: the first consisted of patients with clinical signs compatible with 'possible' CJD but in whom another final diagnosis was made and a second group with a typical evolution of the respective dementia. More focal neurological deficits were observed in AD, DLB or VD patients initially classified as 'possible' CJD than in typical patients. A typical electroencephalogram showing periodic sharp wave complexes was observed in 26 (50%) CJD and 6% of other dementia patients. The 14–3–3 protein was detected in all CJD and 8% of other dementia patients. In patients with rapidly progressive dementia and focal neurological signs, CJD should be considered. When faced with the triad: dementia, myoclonus, and initial memory problems AD should be considered if the disease duration is longer than 1 year. The diagnosis of DLB is suggested, if Parkinsonism or fluctuations are present, whereas a focal onset and compatible brain imaging can indicate VD. Findings suggestive of CJD on EEG, brain imaging, and CSF do not exclude other dementias but make them very unlikely. These observations cannot only assist in the differential diagnosis of CJD but also with the identification of AD, DLB or VD patients with atypical clinical history.

### Characterisation of RT-QuIC negative cases from the UK national CJD research and surveillance programme [^114qMY6h]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal human prion disease characterised by cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor impairment. Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation and propagation of transmissible misfolded proteins, with tissue distribution varying between disease aetiologies posing significant infection control and public health risks. sCJD has a heterogeneous clinical presentation but most often presents with rapidly progressive dementia with associated myoclonus, ataxia, motor symptoms and visual symptoms. The diagnosis of sporadic CJD was previously based on non-specific CSF markers of rapid neuronal injury (e.g. 14–3–3, neuron-specific enolase) alongside archetypal clinical features, electroencephalogram (EEG), and MRI. Recent incorporation of the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test in international consensus diagnosis criteria marked a significant step change in the diagnostic approach to sCJD achieving a very high specificity (98–100%). Despite this, however, RT-QuIC has its limitations due to its sensitivity with approximately 10% of individuals with sCJD testing negative on RT-QuIC.

### Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1161wwQF]. Neurology (2001). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology practice parameter — diagnosis of dementia: Objective is to update the 1994 practice parameter; studies were identified published in English from 1985 through 1999. The DSM–III–R definition of dementia is reliable and should be used (Guideline). The National Institute of Neurologic, Communicative Disorders and Stroke–AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS–ADRDA) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised (DSM–IIIR) diagnostic criteria for AD and clinical criteria for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) have sufficient reliability and validity and should be used (Guideline), while diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia may be of use in clinical practice (Option) but have imperfect reliability and validity. Structural neuroimaging with either a noncontrast CT or MRI scan in the initial evaluation of patients with dementia is appropriate, and because of insufficient data on validity, no other neuroimaging procedure is recommended (Guideline); there are currently no genetic markers recommended for routine diagnostic purposes (Guideline), and the CSF 14–3–3 protein is useful for confirming the diagnosis of CJD (Guideline). Screening for depression, B12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism should be performed (Guidelines), whereas screening for syphilis in patients with dementia is not justified unless clinical suspicion for neurosyphilis is present (Guideline).

### Analysis of clinical features, diagnostic tests, and biomarkers in patients with suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease, 2014–2021 [^111q2PmW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Implementation of RT-QuIC testing may allow earlier and more accurate diagnoses of patients with a broader spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs attributable to CJD, but this test is not perfect. Owing to the complexities involved in running this assay, including prolonged agitation of sample and medium, diagnostic and reporting delays are common. The test may also yield false negative or indeterminant results, as observed in small numbers of patients in this study and others. For these reasons, additional diagnostic biomarkers should be measured in patients with suspected CJD and selected tests (ie, MRI, CSF T-tau, and RT-QuIC) should be repeated when diagnostic suspicion remains high in the face of initial negative or indeterminant test results. MRI is commonly used in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CJD, and for good reason. The MRI sensitivity rate reported in this study at presentation is consistent with that reported in similar studies (39.1%-92.3%). These results affirm the value of MRI in the evaluation of patients with early symptomatic CJD. Yet it is important to highlight that among the psychiatric dominant initial presentation, MRI sensitivity was low, further adding to the diagnostic challenge and risk of diagnostic errors in this clinical subtype. Importantly, repeated scans later in the disease course had high yield, with 112 of 115 patients in this cohort eventually having at least 1 brain MRI result consistent with CJD.

Although elevated CSF protein 14–3–3 level has historically been viewed as a useful marker of CJD, our results suggest that this biomarker may have limited diagnostic application in the modern era. Previous studies report a wide range in diagnostic sensitivity of CSF protein 14–3–3 level, ranging from low (53%) to high (85%-92%,) across cohorts. The poor sensitivity (60% in this study) and specificity (elevated CSF protein 14–3–3 levels have been reported in patients with viral encephalitis, hypoxic encephalopathy, metastases, and metabolic and paraneoplastic syndromes,) suggest that elevated CSF protein 14–3–3 levels have been supplanted by CSF measures of T-tau (affirmed in this study and others) and RT-QuIC. Diagnostic algorithms should be adjusted accordingly.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^111pXbEM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rapidly lethal disease. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is imperative for epidemiological surveillance and public health activities to exclude treatable differentials and facilitate supportive care. In 2017, the International CJD Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria were revised to incorporate cortical ribboning on magnetic resonance imaging and the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay, developments that require multicenter evaluation.

Objective

To evaluate the accuracy of revised diagnostic criteria through the retrospective diagnosis of autopsy-confirmed cases (referred to as in-life diagnosis).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This diagnostic study used a 3-year clinicopathological series using all cases of autopsy-confirmed sCJD and a noncase group with alternative neuropathological diagnoses from national surveillance centers in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. Data were collected from January 2017 to December 2019 and analyzed from January 2020 to November 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity and specificity of revised diagnostic criteria and diagnostic investigations. Secondary analyses assessing sCJD subgroups by genotype, pathological classification, disease duration, and age.

Results

A total of 501 sCJD cases and 146 noncases were included. Noncase diagnoses included neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune encephalitis, and cerebral insults such as anoxia. Participants in the sCJD cases cohort were younger (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [9.8] years vs 72.8 [10.9] years; P < .001) and had longer median (IQR) disease duration (118 [74.8–222.3] days vs 85 [51.5–205.5] days; p = 0.002); sex ratios were equivalent (253 [50.5%] male cases vs 74 [50.7%] male noncases). Sensitivity of revised criteria in in-life diagnosis (450 of 488 [92.2%] diagnoses; 95% CI, 89.5%-94.4%) was increased compared with prior criteria (378 of 488 [77.5%] diagnoses; 95% CI, 73.5%-81.1%; P < .001), while specificity (101 of 125 [80.8%] diagnoses; 95% CI, 72.8%-87.3%) was unchanged (102 of 125 [81.6%] diagnoses; 95% CI, 73.7%-88.0%; P > .99). Among 223 cases and 52 noncases with the full panel of investigations performed, sensitivity of revised criteria (97.8%; 95% CI, 94.9%-99.3%) was increased compared with prior criteria (76.2%; 95% CI, 70.1%-81.7%; P < .001) while specificity was unchanged (67.3%; 95% CI, 52.9%-79.7% vs 69.2%; 95% CI, 54.9%-81.3%; P > .99). In 455 cases and 111 noncases, cortical ribboning was 67.9% sensitive (95% CI, 63.4%-72.2%) and 86.5% specific (95% CI, 78.7%-92.2%). In 274 cases and 77 noncases, RT-QuIC was 91.6% sensitive (95% CI, 87.7%-94.6%) and 100% specific (95% CI, 96.2%-100%). Investigation sensitivity varied with genetic and pathological features, disease duration, and age.

Conclusions and Relevance

This diagnostic study demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity of revised sCJD diagnostic criteria with unaltered specificity. The revision has enhanced diagnostic accuracy for clinical care and surveillance.

### Rare histotype of sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease, clinically suspected as corticobasal degeneration [^11151m9c]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by the pathological accumulation of aberrant prion protein (PrP), neuronal death and spongiform change throughout the brain. With an incidence of approximately 1 in 1 000 000, CJD is a rare but fatal condition. CJD has several possible aetiologies: sporadic (sCJD), familial, iatrogenic (iCJD) and variant CJD (vCJD) in which PrP is transmitted to humans across a species barrier. Different aetiologies of CJD present with different clinical and pathological phenotypes. vCJD typically has an earlier age of onset of approximately 26 years, compared with sCJD in which only 4.5% of cases present before the age of 40 years. vCJD typically presents with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms followed later by sensory abnormalities, ataxia and dementia. In contrast, iCJD and sCJD are more likely to show a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous picture. Histologically, florid plaques are seen in vCJD, whereas iCJD and sCJD can show varying severities of PrP deposition, including 'kuru-like' plaques. Here we present a case of sCJD with an atypical presentation with parkinsonism, prominent early dementia and death within 3 years of symptom onset. We have been able to perform a detailed neuropathological investigation, and have identified this case as a rare subtype of this rare disease, with an unusually long disease course.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1114s714]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

As summarised on the criteria, common clinical findings of sCJD include rapid cognitive and functional decline, memory deficit, personality change, pyramidal/extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, visual deficits and myoclonus. Akinetic mutism may be observed in the later stage of the disease. In our case, the patient had presented with many of the aforementioned typical clinical features. Furthermore, there was no relevant family history or previous surgical history (including the hormonal injection or blood transfusion), thereby ruling out the possibility of familial or iatrogenic forms.

Brain MRI is one of the most informative diagnostic tools when assessing sCJD antemortem. Cortical ribbon sign (hyperintensity on the cortical gyri on the DWI and FLAIR sequences), which was detected in the case, is one of the known characteristic features of CJD.MRI can also assist with excluding other subtypes of CJD, such as the variant subtype of CJD. sCJD is typically demonstrated by cerebral atrophy or increase in signal intensity (especially on a DWI sequence) in the cerebral cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus. As for other forms of CJD, pulvinar sign, basal ganglia and cortical hyperintensity are predominantly found in vCJD and fCJD, respectively.MRI can detect the characteristic sCJD changes reliably according to recent studies, with 91% sensitivity and 95% specificity with DWI and FLAIR sequences. Moreover, studies have also shown that sensitivity was superior for DWI than FLAIR. Therefore, MRI, as a non-invasive investigation, should be performed for any patients with clinical features of CJD.

### An unusual presentation of sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^112s9KM9]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Sporadic Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder. It is uniformly fatal. Clinical signs include myoclonus, visual disturbances, cerebellar ataxia, akinetic mutism and pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs in addition to a rapidly progressive dementia. Premortem diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity of the condition and the subsequent low index of suspicion held for it. On literature review, isolated language impairment as the first neurological symptom occurs in only about 1% of patients with sporadic CJD (El Tawil et al. (2017, Acta Neurol Scand, 135: 316–23)). We present this patient's case, marked for the unusual presentation and the rapidity of decline, to emphasise the need for awareness of CJD as an important differential diagnosis on stroke units. In our case, magnetic resonance imaging findings drove the suspicion of sporadic CJD as the diagnosis. This seems to correlate with other case reports recognising CJD presenting with progressive aphasic disorders (Terrin et al. (2017, Neurol Sci, 38: 1535–7); Mandell et al. (1989, Neurology, 39: 55–8); Martory et al. (2012, Eur Neurol, 67: 360–2)).

### Illustrating the relevance of updated diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease: a teaching neurocase [^112cApgy]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old woman with unremarkable medical history, consulted for a 5-month history of involuntary shaking of left upper limb. Clinical examination revealed polyminimyoclonus of the upper limbs with cogwheel-like rigidity, hyperreflexia, bradykinesia, inconstant spastic-like rigidity in the lower limbs and a stiff and cautious gait. These symptoms, together with the memory impairment found on neuropsychological assessment yielded suspicion for a subacute encephalopathy probably due to a non-conventional infectious agent. There was no 14–3–3 protein found in the cerebrospinal fluid and no periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG. These findings made the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) rather unlikely according to the current WHO diagnostic criteria. However, typical isolated cortical hyperintensity of right temporal, parietal and occipital lobes on MRI suggested a probable CJD and prompted cerebral biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis. This article emphasises the need to update the current WHO criteria by including radiological findings.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^114zBnnB]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

The study was conducted within the framework of an EC-supported multinational study ('CJD markers').

Patients were referred to national surveillance units for detection of CSF 14–3–3 protein during the course of routine clinical diagnosis and surveillance. Samples were sent to the individual laboratories for the detection of CSF 14–3–3, further for CSF tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloid β 1–42 in participating countries between 1998 and 2008. All countries collected clinical and neuropathological data from those patients with a clinical suspicion of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease or related disorders. The corresponding diagnoses were obtained by follow-up.

Patient's data collection and analysis

Clinical data such as age at onset, gender, disease duration, time point of lumbar puncture, final clinical and neuropathological diagnoses were collected by each centre. A database was set up, which included detailed data on the CSF markers and patients' characteristics for a total of 29 022 samples from patients with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and non-Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (other rapid dementia) diagnoses. In 10 731 patients, a definite diagnosis could be obtained. From the remaining 18 291 samples, no further clinical data were available. In all participating centres, the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease was made according to established, internationally agreed criteria.

Control patients were those who proved an alternative diagnosis or in whom Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease was definitely excluded on clinical or pathological grounds. Diagnoses in control patients were based on neuropathology (whenever possible) and clinical follow-up information.

For calculation of 14–3–3 specificity we used a two-step approach: (i) analysis was restricted to patients with a definite diagnosis (n = 10 731) and (ii) total specificity was calculated using all available samples. When a clinical diagnosis was available, patients were assigned to one of the following groups: neurodegenerative, inflammatory, CNS tumour/paraneoplastic, stroke, psychiatric, metabolic and 'other' (Table 1).

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^1165QNjv]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

In our study, we provide results on 'total' 14–3–3 specificity calculated on almost 30 000 CSF analyses. For various reasons (e.g. no information, patients lost at follow up and data protection regulations), the final diagnosis was not always available. We are aware that this might result in a selection bias in relation to the patients where a diagnosis was achieved. On the other hand, definite diagnoses of non-Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases in national reference centres are usually only obtained if the respective patient is seriously suspected to suffer from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. This is much more likely, when 14–3–3 testing shows a (false) positive result. The respective group with a definite diagnosis might therefore be even more prone to selection bias than a control group including all patients reported to the reference centres. Therefore we provided all figures to demonstrate that specificity figures were not affected much by this approach (total specificity 92%, in definite diagnoses specificity: 81–97%).

### Variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease in an elderly patient [^1154YuUn]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

We report a case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease(vCJD) in a 74-year old man in whom diagnosis was made at necropsy. The occurrence of vCJD in an individual in this age group is unlikely to be an isolated event. Doctors need to be aware that vCJD can arise in elderly patients so that appropriate investigations (including magnetic resonance imaging) can be done, and permission for neuropathological necropsy requested, in suspected cases. This case could also have important implications for public health policy decisions and surveillance programmes that target the younger age range of vCJD cases.

### Validation and utilization of amended diagnostic criteria in creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance [^112HuEFc]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate an amended protocol for clinical diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) including real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and to observe its use in CJD surveillance.

Methods

In the framework of a prospective epidemiologic study, all neuropathologically confirmed cases with sCJD who received CSF RT-QuIC analysis during diagnostic workup (n = 65) and a control group of individuals without CJD (n = 118) were selected to investigate the accuracy of an amended diagnostic protocol. The patients had been referred to the German National Reference Center for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies. The influence of the amended protocol on incidence figures was evaluated in the context of 3 years of surveillance activity (screened cases using 14–3–3 test n = 18,789, highly suspicious cases of CJD n = 704). Annual incidences were calculated with current criteria and the amended protocol.

Results

The amended protocol showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. When it was applied to all suspected cases who were referred to the reference center, the assessed incidence of CJD increased from 1.7 to 2.2 per million in 2016.

Conclusion

CJD surveillance remains challenging because information from external health care institutions can be limited. RT-QuIC shows excellent diagnostic accuracy when applied in the clinical setting to symptomatic patients. Data for RT-QuIC alone when applied as a general screening test are not available yet. We propose an amended research protocol that improves early and accurate clinical diagnosis of sCJD during surveillance activities. The use of this protocol will probably lead to a significant increase of the incidence rate.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with suspected sCJD, criteria for clinical diagnosis plus the CSF RT-QuIC accurately identifies patients with sCJD (sensitivity 97%, specificity 99%).

### Updated clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^116qrH1i]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were reported for sCJD and control patients; χ²-test and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test were used to assess differences between categorical and continuous variables.

The goal of our study was to identify the best combination of radiological findings and MRI sequences to discriminate between sCJD and non-sCJD patients. In order to do this we compared the results of visual assessments of brain MRI scans in cases and controls. We considered a brain region as affected when a high signal was found in either FLAIR or DWI MRI sequences. We calculated sensitivity [the percentage of scans considered as characteristic (positive) of sCJD in cases] and specificity [the percentage of scans considered as not characteristic (negative) of sCJD in controls] for several criteria patterns involving different combinations of affected regions and MRI sequences. We also calculated diagnostic odds ratios — the ratio of the odds of positivity in sCJD cases relative to the odds of positivity in the controls — to assess which combinations of criteria patterns yielded better test discriminatory performance; 95% confidence intervals of the diagnostic odds ratios were estimated by the exact method.

Inter-reader agreement for brain MRI scan visual assessment (normal or affected) was calculated, using Cohen's κ coefficient and Concordance Index, for all explored areas included in the standardized protocol. Concordance Index is the percentage of agreement between readers and the κ coefficient shows the difference in agreement, from chance, between them; thus a κ-value of 0 means no different from chance and 1 is perfect agreement.

Ethics

The study was done in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by the International Conference on Harmonization and applicable to national and local laws and regulations. For each participating site, the study protocol and all amendments were approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee. All patients and their caregivers gave written informed consent.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^114r1TQd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

We investigated data from national surveillance units in the United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, and Italy. Neuropathological confirmation of sCJD is the criterion standard method, against which we sought to validate the 2017 diagnostic criteria. All autopsy-confirmed individuals with sCJD who died between January 2017 and December 2019 were included. A noncase control group was established using individuals with suspected CJD excluded on neuropathological examination (ie, autopsy or biopsy) during the same period.

We extracted information regarding demographic and clinical features. Age was defined by the date of tissue acquisition (by either autopsy or biopsy). We did not extract data regarding ethnicity of individuals. Cases were stratified into short, typical, and long survival groups by duration in the first, second and third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, and by age into decades. We collated results of diagnostic investigations, c129 genotype, and PrP Sc type where available. Neuropathological diagnoses in noncases were classified into groups, including neurodegenerative, vascular, inflammatory, infectious, cerebral insults (including anoxia or seizures), miscellaneous diagnoses, and nondiagnostic examinations (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

In-life status was classified by the revised diagnostic criteria (Box). Individuals not meeting criteria definitions were classified as unclear. This category included individuals with limited clinical features and no positive investigation results as well as individuals with inadequate clinical features and a positive investigation that was not RT-QuIC (for example, an individual with ataxia and a positive 14–3–3 assay).

Research related to CJD surveillance has been approved as essential for public health purposes in the UK by the South East Scotland Research Ethics Service, the French Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, the German Federal Ministry of Health and ethics committee of University Medical Centre Göttingen, and the ethics committee of the Istituto superior di Sanità. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals assessed by the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (or their relatives, when participants had impaired cognitive capacity). For German individuals, all legal representatives consented to the scientific use of data; for Italian individuals, patients or their relatives provided consent for research linked to surveillance data; for French surveillance, informed consent was not required because surveillance is considered an essential public health activity. We followed the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guideline.

### Validation of revised international creutzfeldt-jakob disease surveillance network diagnostic criteria for sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^117HF6qB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for individual investigations and for probable diagnosis by prior and revised criteria; denominators for each measure were the numbers of individuals with available investigation results that had sufficient information to allow classification by a given criteria. Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of cases with positive outcomes on individual investigations and for overall criteria classification as probable sCJD. Specificity was defined as the percentage of noncases with negative outcomes, both for individual investigations and for criteria (appropriate classification as outcome other than probable). Positive investigation outcomes were defined as per criteria. An investigation was classified positive if it had been positive at any stage during the individual's assessment. Uninterpretable MRI and EEG sequences degraded heavily by artifact were excluded, as were CSF assays untestable for technical reasons. Weak-positive, indeterminate, or equivocal CSF results were treated as negative.

We assessed diagnostic criteria in 2 ways. The first was a real-world series using cases with clinical information available that had undergone any investigation. In the second, we performed an analysis restricted to cases with all investigations performed. For age comparisons, Student independent samples t tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed. Duration comparison was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test (with post hoc analysis between PRNP c129 groups using Dunn tests with Bonferroni correction factors). Categorical variables were assessed using χ² or Fisher exact tests. McNemar tests were used to assess changes in diagnostic criteria performance. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided P < .05. Analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corp).

### Sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease in the young (50 and below): 10-year review of United Kingdom surveillance [^116YaGQw]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Our referral data showed 47% (41/87) of CJD cases referred to the NCJDRSU were eventually diagnosed with a prion disease other than sCJD in this age group. This highlights the importance of considering other subtypes of CJD in the assessment of younger individuals suspected of sCJD. In particular, vCJD is associated with younger age of onset in the third decade of life compared to sCJD. Early psychiatric symptoms are common before the onset of cognitive and motor dysfunction, and disease duration is prolonged with median survival at 14 months. Our study, and findings from previous work, demonstrate similarities between the clinical features of vCJD and young-onset sCJD. In particular, Mok and colleagues described the most recent case of vCJD in the UK, where a pre-mortem diagnosis of probable sCJD was maintained until vCJD was neuropathologically confirmed on the post-mortem. The individual did not meet the diagnostic criteria for vCJD in-life. The authors hypothesised whether this marked the start of a second wave of vCJD. This case was unique amongst vCJD in its heterozygosity at PRNP codon 129. There is potential for new atypical phenotypes of vCJD that more closely mimic the pre-mortem features of sCJD, although this has so far not materialised. Our data highlights the distinct diagnostic investigation profile of young-onset sCJD, and supports the use of MRI and CSF diagnostic tests to diagnose sCJD pre-mortem using current diagnostic criteria. However, the current situation also reinforce the importance of post-mortem examination in suspected prion disease, and additional vigilance for CJD surveillance programmes worldwide in the assessment of younger individuals.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^113oPhTT]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

The gold-standard investigation for the diagnosis of CJD remains to be a brain biopsy. Despite being a definitive test, the frequency of a positive biopsy result is low with 54%. Another study also found that 42% of the biopsies were non-diagnostic. The main reasons for the low success rate include: first, the samples must show vacuolation when investigated histopathologically, but this may be missed. Second, the biopsy samples must contain a sufficient level of amyloid deposits to be positive in an immunohistochemical test for PrP, and not all of the brain regions can be examined for histological changes. Moreover, the test itself is highly expensive and is rarely indicated; it is performed only if the case is highly suspicious of CJD when other non-invasive tests are negative or at the request of the patients or family members. Therefore, a diagnosis of CJD should depend on a combination of clinical findings and non-invasive investigations including serology, MRI, EEG and CSF analysis. In our patient, a postmortem brain autopsy was performed with family consent. The sample revealed the typical spongiform alteration, gliosis and neuronal loss with detection of prion protein via immunochemistry, thus confirming the diagnosis of definitive sCJD.

Learning points

Known diagnostic criteria for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) must be used in conjunction with a detailed history and appropriate investigations when evaluating patients presenting with rapidly progressive dementia.
CJD can pose a significant diagnostic challenge when accompanied by non-specific or atypical features which differ from known diagnostic criteria.
CJD must be considered as a potential diagnosis for patients who present with rapidly progressive dementia without any evidence of infection or stroke.
A high index of clinical suspicion for CJD, exclusion of differential diagnoses of cognitive decline and appropriate use of available diagnostic tools, including MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and EEG, are crucial in accurately and promptly evaluating a patient with suspected CJD.
MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR sequences should be performed for all patients with suspected CJD. However, MRI findings do not appear to provide information on clinical severity or prognosis.

### Creutzfeldt-jacob disease: new directions in diagnosis and therapeutics [^117WUseo]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results of these studies demonstrate some encouraging progress in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease. Real-time induced quaking is already being introduced into laboratories as a reliable method of detecting sporadic CJD and there is hope that less invasive tests for CJD using patient urine and blood may be on the horizon. However, treatment of CJD remains problematic and the search for effective therapeutic agents continues.

### Creutzfeldt-jacob disease mimics, or how to sort out the subacute encephalopathy patient [^112bZERz]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a rare untreatable neurodegenerative disease which every neurologist will occasionally encounter during their career. However, it is likely to appear on their differential diagnosis list significantly more frequently. Numerous conditions can present with subacute encephalopathy which might be sporadic CJD and this article explores these diagnoses. It includes the commonest sporadic CJD mimics which are neurodegenerative, and highlights the relatively rare treatable mimics which must not be missed. It discusses relevant investigations, including serum antibodies, CSF, electroencephalography and MR brain imaging, and strategies when preliminary investigations fail to support sporadic CJD but no alternative diagnosis is readily apparent.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^1137JDpV]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Another major step in the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease was the introduction of MRI, where a specific pattern in patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, characterized by hyperintense signals in basal ganglia and cortical regions, was identified. Especially sensitive MRI techniques such as FLAIR and diffusion-weighted MRI sequences allow a diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease with high sensitivity and specificity. As a result, a positive MRI scan was proposed to be included into the clinical criteria in 2009.

To date, CSF analysis, in particular protein 14–3–3 testing, presents an important approach in the identification of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases and a request for CSF testing to specialized laboratories is frequently a major way to obtain referrals to surveillance centres. However, one special point of criticism of 14–3–3 testing was a potential loss of specificity and several reports on that have been published. Within the framework of a European Community (EC) supported longitudinal multicentre study ('CJD markers') we evaluated the specificity of 14–3–3 in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease diagnosis from the years 1998–2008. In addition we analysed the spectrum of rapid progressive dementia diagnoses, their potential influence on 14–3–3 specificity as well as results of related dementia markers (tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid β 1–42) in different forms of rapid dementias. We present results of regular ring trials conducted in participating surveillance laboratories to analyse inter-laboratory reliability.

The term 'rapid progressive dementia' or shortened 'rapid dementia' we used in this study summarizes a condition of cognitive deterioration that can be attributed to either a neurological (most commonly neurodegenerative) or non-neurological disease. Potentially reversible conditions (e.g. acute delirium, pseudo-dementia in depression, CNS inflammation) can appear frequently and need to be considered in the diagnostic process.

Results

Demographics and Case Classification

A total of 501 individuals with sCJD (cases) and 146 with alternative diagnoses (noncases) were included (Table 1). Sex ratios for cases and noncases were equivalent (sCJD, 253 [50.5%] men vs noncases, 74 [50.7%] men; p = 0.98). Individuals with sCJD were significantly younger than those in the noncase cohort (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [9.8] years vs 72.8 [10.9] years; P < .001). Median (IQR) disease duration was longer in sCJD cases than for noncases (118 days [74.8–222.3] days vs 85 [51.5–205.5] days; p = 0.002).

Demographic and Clinical Features of Study Cohort

Abbreviation: RPCD, rapidly progressive cognitive decline.

Clinical information was available in 488 cases (97.2%) and 125 noncases (85.6%). All cardinal diagnostic features were significantly more prevalent in cases (eg, cerebellar features: sCJD, 360 individuals [73.8%] vs noncases, 11 individuals [8.8%]; P < .001) (Table 1). The percentage of cases classified as probable (ie, sensitivity) was significantly higher with revised criteria (92.2%; 95% CI, 89.5%-94.4% vs 77.5%; 95% CI, 73.5%-81.1%; P < .001) (Table 2). Of 42 cases previously classified as possible, 17 (3.5% of cohort) were reclassified as probable because of cortical ribboning on MRI, 5 (1.0%) by RT-QuIC, and 10 (2.1%) by both (Table 3). Of 68 cases previously classified as unclear, 40 (8.2%) were reclassified as probable by RT-QuIC.

Finally, RT-QUIC is a widely employed method in the diagnosis of CJD, based on the ability of misfolded prion proteins to induce the conversion of normal prion protein into the misfolded form. Recently, a second generation of RT-QuIC (SG-RT-QuIC) has been developed. Unlike the first generation, which utilizes full-length human prion protein as a substrate; SG-RT-QuIC employs a truncated hamster recombinant PrP substrate (amino acids 90–231) alongside modifications to the original RT-QuIC protocol. This method accelerates the seed conversion efficiency and reduces assay time, offers higher sensitivity (94% vs. 88%) and a faster application compared to FL-RT-QuIC. Currently there is no common consensus on the use of SG-RT-QuiC, particularly useful for ambiguous results or atypical cases.

This case highlights the need for a better understanding of genotypic influence, particularly alterations involving the octapeptide repeat in relation to the highly heterogeneous clinical phenotype in CJD. Neuroinflammatory biomarkers, although potentially unspecific, could serve as an additional tool, particularly in distinguishing organic from functional neuropsychiatric presentations. Their consideration may be relevant in slowly progressive forms where neurodegeneration is less pronounced. Furthermore, while first-generation RT-QuIC is favored for its exceptional specificity, the higher sensitivity of second-generation RT-QuIC may aid in diagnosing more complex and atypical cases.

Conclusions

DWI changes are a hallmark of CJD and should be carefully searched when dealing with RPD patients. CJD-related signal abnormalities may be present in almost all cortical regions and, therefore, frontal lobe changes should be considered for inclusion in the diagnostic criteria as has been recently proposed. DWI negative RPD cases should prompt a suspicion of a diagnosis alternative to CJD and autoimmune encephalitis, with its potential response to treatment, should always be considered. Among npRPD patients, specific MRI pattern might help to address the differential diagnosis, but further studies are needed to define the full range of phenotypic presentation. Due to its high sensitivity to CJD-related brain changes and its very short acquisition time, which could be crucial in poorly compliant RPD patients, DWI seems to represent a mandatory routine MRI tool in the diagnostic work-up of RPD patients. Nonetheless, at least T2-weighted or FLAIR imaging might be pivotal to recognize rare cases of DWI CJD mimics.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) genetic markers — clinical utility: In FTD, a Dutch population showed a relatively high prevalence of tau mutations (17.8% of all FTD; 40.3% of familial FTD), whereas a large U.S. non-AD dementia sample found no mutations, and the yield of screening sporadic suspected FTD cases is likely very low. For DLB, there are no clinically relevant genetic marker associations. For suspected CJD, there is no evidence that prion gene analysis is diagnostically valuable.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease and shows a wide range of early clinical manifestation. We report the case of Ms. A, a 50-year-old woman, who exhibited an atypical psychiatric presentation of CJD at the beginning of the disease, as a depressive disorder with psychotic features. We discuss this case, the clinical attitudes that can lead to misdiagnose such presentation of CJD with other psychiatric diseases, and propose to repeat complementary investigations when the diagnostic is evocated, even if these tests are often negative or nonspecific in the early stages of CJD.

### Creutzfeldt-jakob disease as a cause of dementia [^112bs2UE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The disease is believed to be caused by an abnormal isoform of a cellular glycoprotein known as the prion protein. Our patient is an 84-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the geriatric clinic for evaluation of short-term memory loss and decreased concentration which started 3 months prior to initial evaluation. Rapid progression of dementia demonstrated by severe impairment in tasks with a predominantly visual component, including visual scanning, perceptual reasoning and visual spatial processing. Diagnosis of CJD was determined by characteristic ribboning on brain MRI as well as notable real-time quaking-induced conversion on cerebrospinal fluid.

### Assessing initial MRI reports for suspected CJD patients [^116hiULW]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease, caused by the propagation of assemblies of misfolded prion protein. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) remains the most common human prion disease, contributing 85% of CJD patients. Although a definitive diagnosis of sCJD relies on histopathological confirmation, clinical assessment and investigations can make near certain pre-mortem diagnoses. Of the investigations included in the current diagnostic criteria, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is considered an essential investigation given its ready availability, short acquisition time, and high sensitivity (up to 98%) and specificity (nearly 100%). Characteristic features of sCJD on DWI and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences include high intensity signal changes in cortical, striatal and thalamic regions.

Early identification of sCJD offers opportunities for improved care, avoidance of unnecessary tests and empirical treatments, planning for end of life, and inclusion into clinical trials. PRN100, a monoclonal antibody treatment recently offered to a small number of patients with sCJD, exemplifies one such innovative opportunity which relies on early patient diagnoses. Other experimental compounds are also being developed.

Unfortunately, diagnostic changes of sCJD on MRI are often missed, as evidenced by our paper published in 2012, where we found an overall 47% sensitivity on initial radiology reporting. Subsequent efforts by the National Prion Clinic (NPC) and others to improve awareness of CJD-specific MRI abnormalities has included delivery of lectures to hospital specialists and presentation of our findings at national conferences. The inclusion of DWI to dementia protocols has also become well established. We aimed to re-explore whether there has been any change in the sensitivity of detecting sCJD on MRI, hypothesising that increased awareness amongst clinicians, improved access to MRI and scan protocols, and improved scan quality since our previous study, might have improved rates of diagnosis.

### Classic creutzfeldt-jakob disease | Classic CJD… [^115L1va1]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Classic CJD is a quick-moving, always fatal disease that occurs worldwide.
- It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems.
- CJD mostly occurs in older adults.
- There is no treatment or cure.
- It usually leads to death within a year from when symptoms begin. Overview CJD is caused by a prion, a type of infectious protein. Prions trigger normal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old. Types There are three main types of CJD infection: Sporadic The vast majority of all CJD cases reported are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason.

The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year. Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal grafts or dura mater grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD. How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within one year following the onset of symptoms. Treatment and Prognosis Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a few months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of disease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable.

In general, classic CJD affects people older than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD progresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4–5 months, while vCJD averages more than a year.

### Clinical overview of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (CJD) [^1165wa4d]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive and always fatal neurodegenerative disorder.
- It is believed to be caused by prions, disease-causing agents that can cause abnormal folding of normal proteins in the body.
- Infection usually leads to death within one year of symptom onset.
- CJD occurs worldwide and the estimated annual incidence in many countries, including the United States, has been reported to be about one to two cases per million population. Overview CJD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy along with other prion diseases that occur in humans and animals. CJD was first recognized in the 1920s. The risk of CJD increases with a person's age. In about 85% of patients, CJD occurs as a sporadic disease with no recognizable pattern of transmission. A smaller proportion of patients develop CJD because of inherited mutations of the prion protein gene.

These inherited forms include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia. Confirming CJD in a patient requires neuropathologic and/or immunodiagnostic testing of brain tissue obtained either at biopsy or autopsy. Clinical features CJD typically affects people 55 years old and older. The primary symptom is dementia with early neurologic signs. Once symptoms begin, the patient's decline is fairly quick, with a median of 4–5 months until death. Diagnosis There are standard diagnostic criteria for definite, probable and possible sporadic CJD cases. There are separate diagnostic criteria for cases that may be iatrogenic and those that may be inherited. Patient management Treatment of prion diseases remains supportive. There is unfortunately no specific therapy that has been shown to stop the progression of these diseases.

Not everyone who is thought to have died from prion disease has had their brain tissue analyzed, which is required to confirm prion disease. Because of this, these case counts include people with probable CJD based on clinical tests provided a prion disease diagnosis is listed on their death certificate. A recently developed clinical laboratory test, when positive, has been shown to strongly indicate prion disease. Annual numbers of people with this positive test but no brain tissue analyses can be found on the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center website. More information on the test is available here.

### About CJD… [^112FynSz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

About CJD Classic CJD is a human prion disease. It is a neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic clinical and diagnostic features. This disease is rapidly progressive and always fatal. Infection with this disease leads to death usually within 1 year of onset of illness. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorder believed to be caused by an abnormal isoform of a cellular glycoprotein known as the prion protein. CJD occurs worldwide and the estimated annual incidence in many countries, including the United States, has been reported to be about one case per million population. The vast majority of CJD patients usually die within 1 year of illness onset. CJD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy along with other prion diseases that occur in humans and animals. In about 85% of patients, CJD occurs as a sporadic disease with no recognizable pattern of transmission.

A smaller proportion of patients develop CJD because of inherited mutations of the prion protein gene. These inherited forms include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia. Physicians suspect a diagnosis of CJD on the basis of the typical signs and symptoms and progression of the disease. In most CJD patients, the presence of 14–3–3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or a typical electroencephalogram pattern, both of which are believed to be diagnostic for CJD, have been reported. However, a confirmatory diagnosis of CJD requires neuropathologic and/or immunodiagnostic testing of brain tissue obtained either at biopsy or autopsy.

### About variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease (vCJD) [^111jg9iz]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare disease caused by a prion, an infectious protein.
- It is linked to eating beef from cows infected with "mad cow disease. "
- It is always fatal, usually within 14 months of the first symptoms.
- vCJD illnesses have been very rare since the early 2000s. What it is vCJD is a rare, fatal brain disease that occurs in people. It has been linked to eating meat from cows infected with another prion diseases, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. BSE is sometimes called "mad cow disease". It can take years for someone to develop vCJD symptoms after they were exposed to BSE. But, once symptoms begin, it is always fatal. Most people with vCJD live with the illness for one to two years, with an average time of 13–14 months. Signs and symptoms As with other prion diseases, it takes a long time for people to get sick after contact with the prion. This timeframe can be 10 years or more.

People with vCJD have obvious psychiatric symptoms. Often, this includes depression, anxiety and withdrawal. They may also have a painful condition called dysesthesia. This may feel like itching, burning, pins and needles or other sensations on their body. Later in the illness, patients typically have dementia and neurologic signs such as poor coordination. Causes There is strong evidence vCJD is caused when people eat meat from cows that were infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and cases peaked in the early 1990s. The first vCJD cases were reported in 1996. Feeding cattle meat and bone meal from dead cows, some of which had BSE, contributed to the large U. K. outbreak. Policies to prevent further exposure of animals and humans to BSE led to a dramatic decline in BSE cases.

These included animal feed bans and the removal of infectious cattle tissues, such as the brain, from human food. Scientists believe people may have eaten food potentially contaminated with BSE in the mid-1980s. vCJD cases started appearing about 10 years later. This matches the usual incubation period for other prion diseases.
