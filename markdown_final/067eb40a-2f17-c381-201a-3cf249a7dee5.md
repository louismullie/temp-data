## Question

47 yo F with history of migraines and depression (on sertraline 100 mg daily) presents with acute migraine; reports failed NSAIDs at home. She is afebrile, hypertensive to 152/88, HR 82, normal neuro exam. You consider giving intravenous sumatriptan and prochlorperazine IV for abortive therapy — proceed with both medications as planned?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe and appropriate to administer intravenous sumatriptan together with intravenous prochlorperazine for acute migraine in a 47-year-old woman who is taking sertraline 100 mg daily, and how to weigh efficacy, safety, and drug–drug interactions in this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and potential for serotonin syndrome when combining a triptan with a dopamine antagonist in the presence of an SSRI. Then, I should verify the evidence base for IV prochlorperazine and IV sumatriptan in acute migraine. Next, I will review guideline positions on combination therapy and IV antiemetics. After that, I need to check cardiovascular risk and blood pressure considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safer alternative regimen and monitoring plan, and confirm dosing and contraindications before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core safety concern: serotonin syndrome. Sumatriptan is a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, prochlorperazine is a dopamine antagonist with serotonergic activity, and sertraline is an SSRI; combining serotonergic agents increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, so I need to ensure we do not inadvertently create a triad of excess serotonin activity in this patient [^facd46b3] [^5f46cb6f].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for the proposed IV combination. I initially thought there were robust ED data supporting IV sumatriptan plus IV prochlorperazine, but hold on, I should double-check that. The ED randomized trial that showed superiority of prochlorperazine over hydromorphone used prochlorperazine plus diphenhydramine, not prochlorperazine plus sumatriptan, and it did not evaluate sumatriptan at all, so I should not extrapolate that result to justify the combination here [^86a321bf] [^72db2462]. Similarly, the head-to-head ED trial comparing prochlorperazine versus metoclopramide did not include sumatriptan, so it does not support combining a triptan with a dopamine antagonist in the same session [^f5a11fae] [^99da9ca4]. I should also note that contemporary VA/DoD guidelines conclude there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against IV antiemetics for acute migraine, which further weakens the evidentiary basis for routine IV prochlorperazine in this context [^4bca8859] [^f225be9d].

> Next, I should review the pharmacologic rationale for combining a triptan with an antiemetic. The traditional rationale is to treat nausea and enhance absorption via prokinetic effects, but let me consider whether that applies here. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic, yet it lacks robust prokinetic properties compared with metoclopramide, and there is no evidence that adding prochlorperazine to sumatriptan improves outcomes or offsets gastric stasis; moreover, the risk of extrapyramidal effects and akathisia with prochlorperazine is real and often mitigated by diphenhydramine in trials, which itself adds sedation and anticholinergic burden [^f5a11fae] [^86a321bf]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline endorses this specific IV combination; I do not find a recommendation for IV sumatriptan plus IV prochlorperazine in major guidelines, which instead emphasize triptan monotherapy, triptan plus NSAID combinations, or triptan plus metoclopramide when nausea is prominent, rather than prochlorperazine [^7497f25d] [^2f93b83d] [^d0f7a4b7].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risk and blood pressure. The patient is 47 years old with a blood pressure of 152/88 mmHg; sumatriptan can cause vasoconstriction and transient blood pressure elevation, and it is contraindicated in patients with significant cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. While her BP is not in crisis, it is elevated and warrants caution, baseline ECG consideration, and monitoring if a triptan is used, especially when combined with other agents that may add physiologic stress or sedation [^8a0aafbe] [^d18f08b7]. Let me reconsider whether IV administration changes the risk profile; IV formulations can have rapid onset and abrupt hemodynamic effects, so the threshold for monitoring should be lower in this setting [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the goal is faster relief and the patient cannot take oral medications due to nausea? Subcutaneous sumatriptan is the most effective and fastest-acting triptan formulation, with robust evidence for pain freedom and relief within 1–2 hours, and it avoids the unpredictable absorption of oral agents during migraine; however, even with subcutaneous sumatriptan, I should avoid layering a serotonergic antiemetic like prochlorperazine when the patient is already on an SSRI, and instead pair it with a non-serotonergic antiemetic such as metoclopramide if nausea control is needed [^075fbbdc] [^6b042f3b] [^d0f7a4b7]. I should confirm dosing: subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg is standard, with a second dose after 1 hour if needed, not exceeding 12 mg in 24 hours, and metoclopramide 10 mg IV can be given for nausea without adding serotonergic load [^aa768599] [^7bc8b905].

> Next, I should review safer combination strategies. The strongest outpatient evidence supports adding an NSAID to a triptan for improved sustained pain relief and reduced rescue use; since the patient already failed NSAIDs at home, I should verify whether she received an adequate NSAID dose and consider re-dosing in a monitored setting or using parenteral ketorolac if not contraindicated, rather than defaulting to an opioid or a serotonergic antiemetic combination that increases risk [^2f93b83d] [^3fd32078]. Hold on, I should verify that ketorolac is acceptable here; yes, ketorolac 15–30 mg IV is a reasonable non-opioid, non-serotonergic adjunct in ED migraine care when NSAIDs were ineffective or not feasible orally, and it does not interact with SSRIs or triptans [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address medication overuse and recurrence. Triptans should be limited to no more than 10 days per month to avoid medication-overuse headache, and if attacks are frequent or refractory, preventive therapy should be initiated. In the acute setting, a single dose of dexamethasone can reduce short-term recurrence, though this should be balanced against risks and used selectively [^5b47e0b9] [^d0f7a4b7]. Let me double-check that this aligns with ED practice patterns; yes, a one-time steroid dose is a reasonable adjunct in select cases of refractory migraine or high likelihood of rebound, but it is not a substitute for optimizing acute and preventive strategies [^5f7800c8].

> Putting this together, I should not proceed with IV sumatriptan plus IV prochlorperazine in this patient because of the meaningful risk of serotonin syndrome and the lack of supportive evidence for this combination. Instead, I recommend subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg for rapid relief, with metoclopramide 10 mg IV for nausea if needed, and consider IV ketorolac 15–30 mg if NSAID therapy was inadequate or not feasible, while monitoring blood pressure and watching for serotonergic symptoms. If triptans are contraindicated or not tolerated, gepants are reasonable alternatives in nonpregnant adults [^aa768599] [^7bc8b905] [^b5b51b52]. I should confirm that this plan aligns with guidelines emphasizing triptan-based therapy with NSAID combination when appropriate and avoidance of serotonergic polypharmacy, which it does [^7497f25d] [^2f93b83d] [^d0f7a4b7].

Do not give **IV sumatriptan with IV prochlorperazine** in this patient because of the **risk of serotonin syndrome** from combining a triptan with an SSRI [^facd46b3] [^5f46cb6f]. Prochlorperazine alone is reasonable for acute migraine in the ED, but **add diphenhydramine 25 mg IV** to reduce akathisia risk [^86a321bf] [^f5a11fae]. If a triptan is needed, use subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg without prochlorperazine, and monitor for serotonin toxicity.

---

## Pharmacological considerations and risks

### Serotonin syndrome risk

- **Mechanism**: Sumatriptan (5-HT1B/1D agonist) + sertraline (SSRI) increases serotonin syndrome risk [^facd46b3].
- **Clinical features**: Mental status change, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and hyperthermia.
- **Guideline stance**: Avoid combining triptans with SSRIs/SNRIs when possible; use caution and monitor closely if unavoidable [^c225cdff].

---

### Cardiovascular considerations

Blood pressure effects from sumatriptan include **transient elevations**, and with baseline 152/88 mmHg, further increases are a concern [^d18f08b7]. Vasoconstriction from sumatriptan can precipitate **coronary vasospasm**, especially in patients with vascular risk factors [^40ef7498].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

| **Medication** | **Evidence/guideline support** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| IV prochlorperazine | - Supported for acute migraine in ED [^86a321bf] <br/> - Often combined with diphenhydramine to mitigate akathisia [^72db2462] | - Effective for nausea and pain <br/> - Monitor for EPS and akathisia |
| IV sumatriptan | - Not routinely recommended in ED [^notfound] <br/> - Subcutaneous route preferred for rapid onset [^6b042f3b] | - Serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs <br/> - Cardiovascular risks in hypertensive patients [^8a0aafbe] |

---

## Recommended alternative approach

Given the risks, **avoid IV sumatriptan with IV prochlorperazine** in this patient. Instead:

- **Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV + diphenhydramine 25 mg IV**: effective ED therapy with akathisia prophylaxis [^86a321bf] [^f5a11fae].
- **If a triptan is needed**: use subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg without prochlorperazine, and monitor for serotonin toxicity.
- **Monitor**: watch for serotonin syndrome symptoms and cardiovascular effects if sumatriptan is used [^facd46b3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not administer **IV sumatriptan with IV prochlorperazine** in a patient on sertraline because of serotonin syndrome risk. Use prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine for acute migraine, and if a triptan is required, choose subcutaneous sumatriptan without prochlorperazine, with close monitoring.

Migraine and the combined contraceptive pill?

Women with migraine and active aura have a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke. In women aged less than 45 years, smoking and the combined contraceptive pill further increase the stroke risk.NICE recommends avoiding combined hormonal contraceptives in women who have migraine with aura due to the increased risk of stroke. In these patients, we recommend the progesterone-only pill, contraceptive implant, depot or levonorgesterol intrauterine device.

Treating headache in the emergency department

When managing acute, severe headache in the emergency department, our first concern is to identify red flags (see table 4). An accurate headache history is essential and if a true thunderclap or sinister headache is identified this will need investigating.

Table 4
Secondary headaches presenting to the emergency department

When there is a positive diagnosis of severe migraine, its effective management can ensure high-quality patient care and also facilitates a timely discharge. We offer sumatriptan 6 mg, typically with an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine. A recent systematic review advised against using morphine, tramadol, intramuscular diclofenac, haloperidol or dexamethasone. A period of intravenous rehydration may also help. It is also essential to make a future management plan to help prevent readmissions, which often are multiple in severe migraineurs. Clinicians can review the need for migraine prophylaxis and abortive therapy as an outpatient. A GON block can help patients in crisis before discharge.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — acute treatment of migraine medications — reports that systematic reviews and small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) largely found no meaningful differences among agents: an SR comprising up to three RCTs, depending on the outcome queried, suggested no difference among IV ketorolac, IV metoclopramide, IV chlorpromazine, and IV prochlorperazine for critical efficacy outcomes, while a very small RCT (n = 29) showed benefit of ketorolac over sumatriptan for pain intensity at 1 hour, one RCT suggested benefit of ketorolac over sodium valproate for pain intensity at 1 hour, and one RCT suggested no difference between ketorolac and diclofenac for frequency of adverse events (AEs) at 1 hour; additionally, the only comparison study of newer oral agents was a network meta-analysis (NMA) that found no difference between rimegepant and ubrogepant. Overall, the quality of evidence for this topic was very low, with very few small RCTs with methodological flaws and most studies involving IV treatments used in ED or infusion centers; patient preferences vary little and harms and burdens could not be differentiated because there was little difference among treatment efficacies. The Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, stated that their overall confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and concluded: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific medication over another for the acute treatment of migraine.

### A prospective, randomized trial of intravenous prochlorperazine versus subcutaneous sumatriptan in acute migraine therapy in the emergency department [^39621dbf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Intravenous (IV) prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, after providing written informed consent, patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of migraine received a 500-mL bolus of IV saline solution and either 10 mg prochlorperazine with 12.5 mg diphenhydramine IV plus saline solution placebo subcutaneously or saline solution placebo IV plus 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously. Pain intensity was assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (visual analog scale at baseline and every 20 minutes for 80 minutes). The primary outcome was change in pain intensity from baseline to 80 minutes or time of ED discharge if subjects remained in the ED for fewer than 80 minutes after treatment. Sedation and nausea were assessed every 20 minutes with visual analog scale scales, and subjects were contacted within 72 hours to assess headache recurrence.

Results

Sixty-eight subjects entered the trial, with complete data for 66 subjects. Baseline pain scores were similar for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine and sumatriptan groups (76 versus 71 mm). Mean reductions in pain intensity at 80 minutes or time of ED discharge were 73 mm for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine group and 50 mm for those receiving sumatriptan (mean difference 23 mm; 95% confidence interval 11 to 36 mm). Sedation, nausea, and headache recurrence rates were similar.

Conclusion

IV prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine.

### Sumatriptan (oral route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^8a604140]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using oral sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Sixty-one studies (37,250 participants) compared oral sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. NNTs for sustained pain-free and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose were 9.5 and 6.0, respectively. For sumatriptan 100 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 6.8, 3.5, 6.5, and 5.2, respectively, for the same outcomes. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 50 mg dose, while sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than 50 mg for pain-free and headache relief at two hours, and for sustained pain-free during 24 hours. Treating early, during the mild pain phase, gave significantly better NNTs for pain-free at two hours and sustained pain-free during 24 hours than did treating established attacks with moderate or severe pain intensity. Relief of associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than with placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with the sumatriptan than with placebo, with a clear dose response relationship (25 mg to 100 mg). Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, paracetamol (acetaminophen), acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ergotamine combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^fff729b0]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month. In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

2.2. Early intervention

To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice, where early intervention may be the most effective acute treatment strategy. With many oral triptans, for example, early intervention has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of pain-free responses at 2 hours after treatment than traditional administration (i.e. when headache intensity is moderate or severe): 57% versus 43% for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, 68% versus 47% for eletriptan, 53% versus 38% for almotriptan 12.5 mg, 58% versus 32% for sumatriptan 100 mg, and 66% versus 44% for rizatriptan 10 mg). Early treatment while pain is mild has been associated with higher pain free rates for non-triptan acute treatments as well.

### Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^8e9afe55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Rectal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of rectal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using rectally administered sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Three studies (866 participants) compared rectally administered sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses. For the majority of efficacy outcomes, sumatriptan surpassed placebo. For sumatriptan 12.5 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 5.2 and 3.2 for headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 12.5 mg dose, and there were no significant differences between the two doses for any of the outcomes analysed. The NNTs for sumatriptan 25 mg versus placebo were 4.2, 3.2, and 2.4 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at one hour, and headache relief at two hours, respectively. Relief of functional disability was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, with NNTs of 8.0 and 4.0 for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than with placebo, but there were insufficient data to perform any analyses. Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to one study comparing sumatriptan 25 mg with ergotamine tartrate 2 mg + caffeine 100 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited amounts of data, sumatriptan 25 mg, administered rectally, is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks, with participants in these studies experiencing a significant reduction in headache pain and functional disability within two hours of treatment. The lack of data on relief of headache-associated symptoms or incidence of adverse events limits any conclusions that can be drawn.

### Sumatriptan (subcutaneous route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^075fbbdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Subcutaneous administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using subcutaneous sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies (9365 participants) compared subcutaneous sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 6 mg dose. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 6 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 2.9, 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1 for pain-free at one and two hours, and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively, and 6.1 for sustained pain-free at 24 hours. Results for the 4 mg and 8 mg doses were similar to the 6 mg dose, with 6 mg significantly better than 4 mg only for pain-free at one hour, and 8 mg significantly better than 6 mg only for headache relief at one hour. There was no evidence of increased migraine relief if a second dose of sumatriptan 6 mg was given after an inadequate response to the first. Relief of headache-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than placebo. Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide, and dihydroergotamine, but there were insufficient data for any pooled analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Subcutaneous sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, quickly relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

Migraine abortive pharmacotherapy — We recommend eletriptan, frovatriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan (oral or subcutaneous), the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen, or zolmitriptan (oral or intranasal) for the acute treatment of migraine. We recommend aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine for the acute treatment of migraine. We suggest acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen for the acute treatment of migraine. We suggest rimegepant or ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine. We suggest against intravenous ketamine for the acute treatment of migraine. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^fb74c106]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events.

If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.

Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation).

### Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults-overview of cochrane reviews [^6b042f3b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. It is available for administration by four different routes: oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal.

Objectives

To summarise evidence from four Cochrane intervention reviews on the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults by four routes of administration (oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal) compared with both placebo and active comparators.

Methods

The included reviews were written by the authors of this overview; no additional searching was carried out. All included reviews were conducted according to a standard protocol and reported a standard set of outcomes. From each individual review we extracted results for pain relief at different levels, and adverse events. No additional statistical comparison was undertaken as part of the overview. We focused on the most important findings for doses and routes licensed in North America or Europe (oral 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; subcutaneous 4 mg, 6 mg; intranasal 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg; rectal 25 mg).

Main Results

Included reviews provided data for 18 different dose and route of administration combinations in 52,236 participants. Data for the primary outcomes sought were generally well reported, and involved adequate numbers of participants to give confidence in the results, except for the rectal route of administration, where numbers were low. Subcutaneous administration was the most effective, with pain reduced from moderate or severe to none by two hours in almost 6 in 10 people (59%) taking 6 mg sumatriptan, compared with approximately 1 in 7 (15%) taking placebo; the number needed to treat (NNT) was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.4) with 2522 participants in the analysis. The most commonly used doses of oral, rectal, and intranasal sumatriptan also provided clinically useful pain relief, with the oral 50 mg dose providing complete relief of pain in almost 3 in 10 people (28%) compared with about 1 in 10 (11%) after placebo (NNT 6.1 (5.5 to 6.9) in 6447 participants). Subcutaneous administration provided more rapid pain relief than the other routes. Taking medication early, when pain was mild, was more effective than waiting until the pain was moderate or severe. The most effective dose of sumatriptan for each route of administration for the outcome of headache relief (pain reduced from moderate or severe to none or mild) at two hours was oral 100 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.2 to 3.7) in 7811 participants), subcutaneous 6 mg (NNT 2.1 (2.0 to 2.2) in 2738 participants), intranasal 20 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.1 to 4.1) in 2020 participants), and rectal 25 mg (NNT 2.4 (1.9 to 3.4) in 240 participants). Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate severity, of short duration, and more common with subcutaneously administered sumatriptan and higher doses of oral and intranasal sumatriptan than with other dose and route combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

Sumatriptan is an effective abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, but is associated with increased adverse events relative to placebo. The route of administration influences efficacy, particularly within the first hour after administration. Subcutaneous sumatriptan shows the greatest efficacy in terms of pain relief, but at the expense of relatively high levels of adverse events, and with a high financial cost compared with other routes. Information about the relative efficacy of the different routes of administration for different outcomes should help to inform decisions about the suitability of sumatriptan as a migraine treatment, as well as about the most appropriate way to administer the treatment for individual patients.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^bd4b527c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on 'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen, administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via The Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) to 28 October 2015, MEDLINE (via Ovid) from 1946 to 28 October 2015, and EMBASE (via Ovid) from 1974 to 28 October 2015, and two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

For this update we identified one new study (43 participants), but it did not contribute any data for analysis. The review included 13 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity. Twelve studies contributed data for analyses: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. We judged only one small study to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated; it did not contribute to any analyses. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for the primary outcomes of pain-free and headache relief at two hours. The NNT for pain-free at two hours was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5) when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 (4.3 to 5.7) when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than with sumatriptan (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review were not changed. Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone were not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose.

More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

ED migraine treatment — prochlorperazine plus diphenhydramine versus hydromorphone: In a randomized double-blind study in 2 EDs, eligible adults ≥ 21 y with moderate or severe migraine and no opioid use in the last month were randomized in blocks of 4 to hydromorphone 1 mg or prochlorperazine 10 mg plus diphenhydramine 25 mg; the primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 h of medication administration and maintaining that level for 48 h without the requirement of rescue medication. The trial was halted by the data monitoring committee after enrollment of 127 patients; sustained relief occurred in the prochlorperazine arm by 37 of 62 (60%) versus in the hydromorphone arm by 20 of 64 (31%) (difference 28%, 95% CI 12% to 45%; NNT 4, 95% CI 2% to 9%). Potential for selection bias is noted due to uncontrolled confounders including severity of the underlying headache disorder, concomitant medication-overuse headache, and baseline opioid use.

### WITHDRAWN: oral sumatriptan for acute migraine [^4e0eff82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of disabling headache, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and, in some patients, neurological aura symptoms. Sumatriptan is one of a class of selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B/1D) agonists (triptans) thought to relieve migraine attacks by several mechanisms, including cranial vasoconstriction and peripheral and central neural inhibition.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 through November 2001), and reference lists of articles and books.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind RCTs comparing oral sumatriptan (100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg) with placebo, no intervention, other drug treatments, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine in adults. Trials comparing different doses of sumatriptan or dosing regimens were also included. Outcomes considered were: 2-hour pain-free response, headache relief/headache intensity, and functional disability; headache recurrence; and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted by one reviewer and over-read by the other. The two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Information on adverse events was collected from trial reports.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials involving 16,200 participants were included. Methodological quality was generally good. Sixteen trials were placebo comparisons and showed that sumatriptan in doses of 100 mg (14 trials), 50 mg (five trials), and 25 mg (three trials) provided significantly better pain-free response (100 mg and 25 mg only), headache relief, and relief of disability at 2 hours. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) for pain-free response at 2 hours were 5.1 (3.9 to 7.1) for the 100-mg dose (n = 2221) and 7.5 (2.7 to 142) for the 25-mg dose (n = 131); there was no significant difference between the 50-mg dose and placebo for this outcome (n = 127). For headache relief at 2 hours, NNTs were 3.4 (3.0 to 4.0), 3.2 (2.4 to 5.1), and 3.4 (2.3 to 6.6) for sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 2940), 50 mg (n = 420), and 25 mg (n = 226), respectively. Precise estimates of the efficacy of the 50- and 25-mg doses relative to the 100-mg dose could not be obtained. Adverse events were more common with sumatriptan 100 mg than with placebo (risk difference [RD] = 0.14 [0.09 to 0.20]; number-needed-to-harm [NNH] = 7.1 [5.0 to 11.1]; n = 3172). RDs for the 50- and 25-mg vs. placebo comparisons were not statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan has been shown to be an effective drug for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine. It is well tolerated, though minor adverse events were not uncommon in the included trials. Other triptans were generally similar in efficacy and adverse events. Among non-triptan drugs, ergotamine + caffeine was significantly less effective than sumatriptan, and other drugs have been insufficiently studied to draw firm conclusions.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### Treatment of acute migraine headache [^5f7800c8]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine headache is a common and potentially debilitating disorder often treated by family physicians. Before diagnosing migraine, serious intracranial pathology must be ruled out. Treating acute migraine is challenging because of substantial rates of nonresponse to medications and difficulty in predicting individual response to a specific agent or dose. Data comparing different drug classes are relatively scarce. Abortive therapy should be used as early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Effective first-line therapies for mild to moderate migraine are nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and combination analgesics containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Triptans are first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine, or mild to moderate migraine that has not responded to adequate doses of simple analgesics. Triptans should be avoided in patients with vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic migraine. Intravenous antiemetics, with or without intravenous dihydroergotamine, are effective therapies in an emergency department setting. Dexamethasone may be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in preventing short-term headache recurrence. Intranasal lidocaine may also have a role in relief of acute migraine. Isometheptene-containing compounds and intranasal dihydroergotamine are also reasonable therapeutic options. Medications containing opiates or barbiturates should be avoided for acute migraine. During pregnancy, migraine may be treated with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (prior to third trimester), or opiates in refractory cases. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, intranasal sumatriptan, and intranasal zolmitriptan seem to be effective in children and adolescents, although data in these age groups are limited.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^642d643d]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.7. Dose-response curves and dosage

Recommendations:

1.2.7.1. Dose-response curves should be defined clearly in early (phase I and II) randomized, clinical trials of new chemical entities for the acute treatment of migraine.

1.2.7.2. Efficacy- and tolerability-based minimum effective and optimal doses should be determined.

1.2.7.3. Effective doses of a well-established or standard drug should be utilized in comparative clinical trials, unless clinically inappropriate, in which case a clear justification for the particular dose selection should be given.

Comments:

New acute treatments for migraine should be tested against a standard comparator with established dose-response curves and optimal efficacy- and tolerability-based doses, such as rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan; the CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e.g.epants) ubrogepant and rimegepant; or the 5-HT 1F receptor agonist lasmiditan.

The accepted optimal therapeutic dose of the comparator should be used.

1.2.8. Route of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.8.1. When pre-clinical and PK data demonstrate an acceptable PK profile in humans (i.e.g.ood oral bioavailability and rapid oral absorption), oral administration of the test treatment is recommended because the oral route is preferred by most people with migraine.

1.2.8.2. Alternative routes of administration, including parenteral, inhalational, buccal, intranasal, and rectal, can be utilized as circumstances dictate (e.g. severe nausea, status migrainosus).

Comments:

Gastric absorption of orally-administered medications can be delayed during migraine attacks. In early phase I or II trials, therefore, it is advisable to establish the intra- and interictal PK profile of oral treatments utilizing a crossover design in order to gauge dose selection in later efficacy trials.

### Triptans (serotonin, 5-HT1B / 1D agonists) in migraine: detailed results and methods of a meta-analysis of 53 trials [^f2bed537]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

The triptans, selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D agonists, are very effective acute migraine drugs. Soon, seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13 different oral doses, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis. We wished to provide an evidence-based foundation for using triptans in clinical practice, and to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trials. We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for the 'raw patient data' of all double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trials with oral triptans in migraine. All data were cross-checked with published or presented data. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and compared these with those from direct, head-to-head, comparator trials. Out of 76 eligible clinical trials, 53 (12 not yet published) involving 24089 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results (and 95% confidence intervals) for sumatriptan 100 mg, the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan, are 59% (57–60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27–30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18–21) for sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2–24 h post-dose), and 67% (63–70) for consistency (response in at least two out of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) are 13% (8–18), for at least one central nervous system AE 6% (3–9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0–2.7). Compared with these data: rizatriptan 10 mg shows better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability; eletriptan 80 mg shows better efficacy, similar consistency, but lower tolerability; almotriptan 12.5 mg shows similar efficacy at 2 h but better sustained pain-free response, consistency, and tolerability; sumatriptan 25 mg, naratriptan 2.5 mg and eletriptan 20 mg show lower efficacy and better tolerability; zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg, eletriptan 40 mg, and rizatriptan 5 mg show very similar results. The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest substantially lower efficacy. The major methodological issues involve the choice of the primary endpoint, consistency over multiple attacks, how to evaluate headache recurrence, use of placebo-subtracted proportions to control for across-study differences, and the difference between tolerability and safety. In addition, there are a number of methodological issues specific for direct comparator trials, including encapsulation and patient selection. At marketed doses, all oral triptans are effective and well tolerated. Differences among them are in general relatively small, but clinically relevant for individual patients. Rizatriptan 10 mg, eletriptan 80 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg provide the highest likelihood of consistent success. Sumatriptan features the longest clinical experience and the widest range of formulations. All triptans are contra-indicated in the presence of cardiovascular disease.

### A randomized controlled trial of prochlorperazine versus metoclopramide for treatment of acute migraine [^f5a11fae]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare prochlorperazine 10 mg intravenously versus metoclopramide 20 mg intravenously for the emergency department (ED) treatment of acute migraine.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing 2 parenteral dopamine antagonists. Both drugs were administered during 15 minutes with 25 mg intravenous diphenhydramine. Pain scores on a numeric rating scale were assessed at baseline, every 30 minutes for 2 hours, and by telephone 24 hours after discharge. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in change in numeric rating scale from baseline to 1 hour postbaseline. Secondary endpoints included mean differences in change in numeric rating scale at 2 and 24 hours, headache relief, adverse effects, and desire to receive the same treatment for future migraines.

Results

Of 152 patients screened, 97 were eligible and 77 were randomized. The mean change in numeric rating scale scores at 1 hour was 5.5 and 5.2 in subjects receiving prochlorperazine and metoclopramide, respectively (difference = 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.0 to 1.6). Findings were similar at 2 hours and 24 hours. Forty-six percent (18/39) of prochlorperazine and 32% (12/38) of metoclopramide subjects reported adverse events (difference = 15%; 95% CI -6% to 36%). Seventy-seven percent (26/34) of prochlorperazine and 73% (27/37) of metoclopramide subjects wanted to receive the same medication in future ED visits (difference = 4%; 95% CI -16% to 24%).

Conclusion

Either prochlorperazine 10 mg intravenously or metoclopramide 20 mg intravenously, combined with diphenhydramine 25 mg intravenously, is an efficacious treatment for ED patients with acute migraine. Three quarters of subjects in both arms would want the same medication for their next migraine.

### Sumatriptan (intranasal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^fa5a028e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Intranasal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting, although it is primarily absorbed in the gut, not the nasal mucosa.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using intranasal sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Twelve studies (4755 participants) compared intranasal sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 10 mg and 20 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 10 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 7.3, 7.4, and 5.5 for pain-free at two hours, and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. For sumatriptan 20 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 4.9, and 3.5, respectively, for the same outcomes. The 20 mg dose was significantly better than the 10 mg dose for each of these three primary efficacy outcomes. Relief of headache-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than placebo. Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to two studies, one comparing sumatriptan 20 mg and dihydroergotamine (DHE) 1 mg, and one comparing sumatriptan 20 mg with rizatriptan 10 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Intranasal sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events compared with placebo.

### CGRP and migraine [^9f903a8a]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

BMS-927711 for the acute treatment of migraine: a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-ranging trial

Previous studies of CGRP antagonists have been limited by early termination due to liver toxicity. This well-designed, single-dose, double-blind, randomized, multicenter evaluation of the CGRP antagonist BMS-927711 measures efficacy as an acute migraine therapy. 1026 patients were enrolled and 885 randomized to receive a single dose of placebo, 100 mg sumatriptan, or one of 6 different doses of BMS-927711 (10, 25, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg). Exclusion criteria included a history of vascular disease and the concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Prophylactic migraine therapy was allowed but the use of other acute therapies was prohibited 2 days prior to randomization. A Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates allocated groups to the more effective doses of BMS-927711 as the trial progressed.

32.9% of subjects on the 150 mg dose achieved pain freedom at 2 h post-dose. Sumatriptan and the 75, 150, and 300 mg doses of BMS-927711 were all significantly superior to placebo (< 0.001, and < 0.002, respectively). The 600 mg dose did not provide any additional benefits. Total migraine freedom was primarily achieved by the 75 mg dose (28.2% of patients). The authors also explored additional efficacy endpoints such as pain relief, sustained pain relief and pain freedom over 2–48 h — all of which were achieved by sumatriptan and the 75, 150, 300 and 600 mg doses of BMS-927711.

The antagonist was overall well tolerated with a dose-related effect of nausea being the most reported adverse event. Cardiovascular side effects were only reported by patients on sumatriptan.

### Randomized evaluation of octreotide vs prochlorperazine for ED treatment of migraine headache [^35e581a3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Patients with headaches account for approximately 2% of all ED visits, with migraines being the most common defined primary headache syndrome. Our goals were to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous octreotide (OC) for the treatment of migraines, when compared to standard therapy with prochlorperazine.

Methods

The study was conducted as a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Each subject received either 100 microg of octreotide or 10 mg of prochlorperazine intravenously for a 2-minute period.

Results

Comparison of the change in median visual analog scale scores for 60 minutes demonstrated that octreotide was less effective at reducing pain (P = 0.03) and producing clinical success (P < .01). Restlessness consistent with akathisia was noted by 35% of the PC group and 8% of the OC group (P < .01). At 60 minutes, rescue medication was required by 48% of the patients in the OC group, whereas 10% of the PC group required such therapy (P < .01). All 44 patients were contacted for follow-up at 48 to 72 hours after enrollment. At that time, 10% of the prochlorperazine and 25% of the octreotide patients had experienced some headache recurrence (P = 0.1).

Conclusion

Prochlorperazine was statistically superior to octreotide in clinical success rate and decrease in pain in migraine patients but caused more restlessness and sedation.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^67a741dc]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other.

Acute management of migraine

Practice has gradually shifted from a treatment paradigm involving gradually escalating abortive therapy towards now starting with combination therapy — non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol and triptan — from the outset (box 1). This shift follows the NICE (CG150) guideline's cost–utility analysis, which evaluated costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) outcome measures. Based on this analysis, triptan plus NSAIDs combination was more effective than other acute migraine approaches, including triptan monotherapy (box 1 shows costs for various triptans); this, therefore, offers patients the best hope of rapid migraine resolution for an acute attack. The guideline's recommendation includes an antiemetic, even if nausea is not pronounced, to counter gastric stasis and so facilitating tablet absorption and pain relief. Last year, the European Medicines Agency issued a warning about domperidone being associated with a small risk of sudden cardiac death and fatal arrhythmias, particularly in those aged over 60 years. They recommended avoiding its prolonged use or doses above 30 mg daily. Patients taking medications that prolong the electrocardiography Q wave to T wave interval should avoid it and those with cardiac comorbidities should exercise caution. NICE recommends avoiding ergots and opioids.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^40ef7498]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS).

Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse:

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

### Randomized study of IV prochlorperazine plus diphenhydramine vs IV hydromorphone for migraine [^72db2462]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine outcomes among patients with migraine in the emergency department (ED) who receive IV hydromorphone vs IV prochlorperazine + diphenhydramine.

Methods

This study was conducted in 2 EDs in New York City. Patients who met international criteria for migraine were eligible for participation if they had not used an opioid within the previous month. Clinicians, participants, investigators, and research personnel were blinded to treatment. Patients were randomized in blocks of 4. Participants received hydromorphone 1 mg or prochlorperazine 10 mg + diphenhydramine 25 mg. Diphenhydramine was administered to prevent akathisia, a common side effect of IV prochlorperazine. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 hours of medication administration and maintaining that level for 48 hours without the requirement of rescue medication. A planned interim analysis was conducted once 48-hour data were available for 120 patients.

Results

The trial was halted by the data monitoring committee after 127 patients had been enrolled. The primary outcome was achieved in the prochlorperazine arm by 37 of 62 (60%) participants and in the hydromorphone arm by 20 of 64 (31%) participants (difference 28%, 95% confidence interval 12–45, number needed to treat 4, 95% confidence interval 2–9).

Conclusions

IV hydromorphone is substantially less effective than IV prochlorperazine for the treatment of acute migraine in the ED and should not be used as first-line therapy.

Clinicaltrialsgov Identifier

NCT02389829.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that for patients in the ED with migraine, IV prochlorperazine + diphenhydramine is superior to IV hydromorphone.

### Prochlorperazine vs. promethazine for headache treatment in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^cab8804b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Headache is a very common medical complaint. Four to six percent of the population will have a debilitating headache in their lifetime; and 1–2% of all Emergency Department (ED) visits involve patients with headaches. Although promethazine is used frequently, it has never been studied as a single-agent treatment in undifferentiated headache. We hypothesized that promethazine would be superior to prochlorperazine in the treatment of headache. We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial on patients presenting to our ED between May and August 2005 with a chief complaint of headache. Each subject was randomized to receive either intravenous promethazine 25 mg or prochlorperazine 10 mg, and graded the intensity of their headache on serial 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS). Patients with dystonic reactions or akathesia were treated with diphenhydramine. Adequate pain relief was defined as an absolute decrease in VAS score of 25 mm. After discharge from the ED, patients were queried regarding the recurrence of headache symptoms, the need for additional pain medications, and the occurrence of any side effects since discharge. Thirty-five patients were enrolled in each group. Both drugs were shown to be effective in treatment of headaches. Prochlorperazine provided a faster rate of pain resolution and less drowsiness when compared to promethazine. Both medications were individually effective as abortive therapy for headache. Prochlorperazine was superior to promethazine in the rate of headache reduction and rate of home drowsiness, with similar rates of akathesia, nausea resolution, patient satisfaction, and headache recurrence within 5 days of discharge.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^5b47e0b9]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The triptans

We advise patients to use a triptan at the start of the headache phase of a migraine attack, since there is no evidence of efficacy if taken during preceding aura. Using a triptan at the start of the headache may reduce headache recurrence, prevent disability and possibly reduce central sensitisation. The difficulty arises in chronic migraineurs, since taking the triptan early can lead to a pattern of increasing use and medication-overuse headache. We try to help these people to identify early features that might indicate an ensuing severe migraine attack, as the triptan should be reserved for these headaches. It is important to explain that the triptan should be used, on average, on no more than 2 days per week (10 days per month) to reduce the risk of a triptan-overuse headache.

Our own practice is to try any particular triptan on at least three occasions before assessing its efficacy. Poor efficacy or tolerability with a single triptan does not reliably predict response to another, so it is definitely worthwhile working through different agents. However, choosing the right triptan for a given situation can be difficult, especially when considering second-line or third-line choices. Figure 1 and the following section may assist this decision.

Figure 1
Triptan selection in acute migraine. An approach to triptan selection based on the characteristic of acute attacks. BD, twice daily; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TDS, three times a day.

Which triptan and how do they work?

The seven triptans — almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan — are 5HT 1B/1D receptor agonists with vasoconstrictive effects on blood vessels. The choice of triptan depends on efficacy, side effects, the duration of the headache, coexisting vomiting and cost (table 2).

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^fce5d961]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Optimised acute treatment

The acute treatment protocol emphasised treatment with a 5-HT 1B/D agonist or triptan. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) and anti-emetic (metoclopramide) agents could be added as needed. The choice of triptans available at the time of the study design (rizatriptan, sumatriptan), the route(s) of administration of triptan (oral, nasal spray, subcutaneous injection), and the addition of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or anti-emetic agent were tailored to the participant's preference, treatment history, and response to acute treatment. Rescue drugs (such as steroids) could also be prescribed. We used individualised handouts and a phone call at week 3 of the run-in period to help participants to evaluate and optimise their acute treatment (for example, to adjust the dose to minimise side effects). Trials of preventive drugs generally have not specified a protocol for acute treatment or attempted to optimise acute treatment but permitted the use of acute treatments as rescue drugs. In these trials, participants recorded use of rescue drugs, but these data have not been reported in publications.

### Updated evaluation of IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) for refractory migraine: patient selection and special considerations [^7735b447]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Centers

Patients who do not have adequate at-home treatment options lack access to outpatient infusion centers, or who have intractable nausea and vomiting may present to an emergency department (ED) or urgent care center (UCC) for treatment. There have been few strong studies of DHE use in the EDand none in the UCC setting. In one class 3 study in the ED, patients were randomized to DHE 1 mg SC or sumatriptan 5 mg SC. The outcome favored sumatriptan at 1 and 2 hours though not at 3 hours, suggesting a more durable effect of DHE at aborting a migraine attack. Due to the lack of rigorous studies, however, the use of IV DHE in the ED setting does not garner a strong recommendation. Despite this, it is used commonly in many EDs and UCCs, often as part of a "migraine cocktail" incorporating antiemetic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Further study is warranted to establish best practices with DHE under these circumstances.

Inpatient

Certain populations of patients benefit from inpatient admission for the management of migraine. Among them include patients with status migrainosus, dehydration or intractable nausea/vomiting, dependence on opioids or barbiturates requiring detoxification, medical disease requiring careful observation, outpatient treatment failure, frequent ED visits, and those requiring comprehensive medical or psychiatric co-management.

For patients with a longstanding history of refractory migraine, inpatient treatment improves pain and disability and reduces analgesic overuse. Multiple drugs can be used in the inpatient setting along with DHE to enhance its effects, manage other symptoms of migraine, and mitigate adverse events. Inpatient use was first described by Raskin, in which 55 patients with continuous headache, most of whom were overusing acute medications, received IV DHE at a dose between 0.3 mg and 1 mg every 8 hours for 2 days. At the end of treatment, 89% of patients were headache-free with most reporting lasting benefit.

Step 4: Acute treatment

Acute treatments can be classified as first-line, second-line, third-line and adjunct (Table 3), and should be used in a stepped care approach(Fig. 2). Our recommendations for each line of treatment are outlined below. The medications at each stage were selected on the basis of efficacy, tolerability, safety, cost and availability.

Table 3

Fig. 2
Stepped care across migraine attacks.

Preventive therapy, in addition, may be indicated at any stage. In general, initiation of preventive therapy is indicated in patients who are adversely affected on ≥ 2 days per month despite acute treatment optimized according to the stepped care approach. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

First-line medication

Over-the-counter analgesics are used worldwide for acute migraine treatment. Those with proven efficacy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the strongest evidence supports use of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium as first-line medications –. Paracetamol has less efficacyand should be used only in those who are intolerant of NSAIDs.

Second-line medication

Patients for whom over-the-counter analgesics provide inadequate headache relief should be offered a triptan. All triptans have well-documented effectiveness, but availability of and access to each vary between countries. Triptans are most effective when taken early in an attack, when the headache is still mild. However, no evidence supports the use of triptans during the aura phase of a migraine attack. If one triptan is ineffective, others might still provide relief. When all other triptans have failed or in patients who rapidly reach peak headache intensity or cannot take oral triptans because of vomiting, sumatriptan by subcutaneous injection can be useful.

Some patients can experience relapses, which are defined as a return of symptoms within 48 h after apparently successful treatment. Upon relapse, patients can repeat their triptan treatment or combine the triptan with simultaneous intake of fast-acting formulations of naproxen sodium, ibuprofen lysine or diclofenac potassium. However, patients should be informed that repeating the treatment does not preclude further relapses and ultimately increases the risk of developing MOH.

### Intravenous fluid for the treatment of emergency department patients with migraine headache: a randomized controlled trial [^55e055f2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and necessity of performing a large-scale trial to measure the effect of intravenous fluid therapy on migraine headache pain.

Methods

This was a single-center, pilot randomized controlled trial. We randomized adult emergency department migraine headache patients to receive 1 L of normal saline solution during 1 hour (fluid group) or saline solution at 10 mL/hour for 1 hour (control group). All patients received intravenous prochlorperazine and diphenhydramine at the start of fluid administration. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded; nurses administering the intervention were not. Outcomes were assessed at 60 and 120 minutes, and 48 hours. The primary outcome was the difference in the verbal pain rating (on a scale of 0 to 10) between 0 and 60 minutes. Key secondary outcomes included additional clinical endpoints, the rate of protocol completion, and the effectiveness of blinding.

Results

Fifty patients consented to participate; one withdrew, leaving 25 patients randomized to the fluid group and 24 in the no fluid group. The mean improvement in 0- to 60-minute pain score was 4.5 (95% confidence interval 3.7 to 5.3) in the fluid group and 4.9 (95% confidence interval 3.5 to 6.2) in the control group. Primary outcome data were collected for 49 of 50 enrolled patients, and only one participant correctly identified the group assignment.

Conclusion

This pilot study showed no statistically significant treatment effect from fluid administration, but does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important treatment effect. The study protocol and approach to blinding are both feasible and effective.

### Ubrogepant in the acute management of migraine: a narrative review [^7a89747b]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Coadministration of Ubrogepant with Other Medications

Individualized migraine treatment includes potentially combining different types of acute migraine medications and often providing preventive therapies.

A Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover, single-dose, pharmacokinetic interaction study investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between sumatriptan and ubrogepant. In this study, 30 healthy participants received each of the following three medication regimens – single dose of ubrogepant 100 mg, single dose of sumatriptan 100 mg, and ubrogepant 100 mg plus sumatriptan 100 mg, with a 7–day washout period between treatments. The study showed there were slight changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of ubrogepant when administered with sumatriptan, in that the ubrogepant median time to maximum plasma concentration was delayed (3 hours [range: 1–5 hours] vs 1.5 hours [range: 1–4 hours]), mean maximum plasma concentration was reduced by 24% (coefficient of variation: 37.4%) when ubrogepant was administered with sumatriptan (n = 29) compared with ubrogepant administered alone (n = 30). The authors concluded such changes are expected to have minimal clinical relevance as no changes were seen in sumatriptan area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration when administered with ubrogepant. There was no treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) when ubrogepant was administered with sumatriptan. All adverse events in the study were mild and resolved within 24 hours.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: a position statement of the international headache society [^47f8b729]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparators

The developers of new health technologies typically conduct randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy using placebo as a control. For HTAs in migraine, it is recommended that new technologies be compared with an established treatment in the specific patient population of interest. If head-to-head trials comparing relevant interventions are not available at the time of assessment, HTAs should employ indirect or mixed-treatment comparisons (e.g. network meta-analyses) to estimate relative effectiveness, provided that the trials being analysed have comparable treatment periods, endpoints, assessments, and populations. Whenever required, statistical adjustments for potential confounders of treatment effects should be included. The HTA process should be fully inclusive of relevant stakeholders, particularly patients and/or patient groups (including public hearings by the HTA authorities)

Acute treatment

Appropriate comparators for technologies intended for the acute treatment of migraine include the oral tablet formulations of sumatriptan 50 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, rizatriptan 10 mg, or eletriptan 40 mg and 80 mg. For new technologies intended for patients who do not respond to triptans, do not tolerate them, or have cardiovascular contraindications that preclude their use, appropriate comparators include a different class of medications (e.g. NSAIDs), usual care, or placebo. With usual care as the comparator, real-world data on headache patterns and treatments are required, and patients who have a history of failure with currently available treatments should be analysed. The main challenge with using placebo as a control is that results may lack external validity; placebo is not given as a treatment for migraine in clinical practice.

Preventive treatment

Comparators that may be used for efficacy trials technologies intended for the preventive treatment of migraine include propranolol 80 mg to 160 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg, flunarizine 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, amitriptyline 25 mg to 50 mg, and mAbs against CGRP or the CGRP receptor (e.g. monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg). For populations that include patients with chronic migraine, appropriate comparators include onabotulinumtoxinA 155 IU to 195 IU; topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg; monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg; and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg.

### Tolerability and effectiveness of prochlorperazine for intractable migraine in children [^28a7f273]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effectiveness of prochlorperazine in aborting severe, intractable migraines in children.

Study Design

Patients for this study were drawn from the population seen and evaluated in the Headache Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All patients were diagnosed with migraine headache by both clinical and International Headache Society criteria. The effectiveness of intravenous prochlorperazine in 20 consecutive patients referred to the emergency department for severe, prolonged migraines was retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Patients evaluated in this study presented with a mean headache severity of 8.4 on a 0- to 10-point scale and an average duration of 54 hours. At 1 hour, 90% of the patients reported feeling better with 50% becoming pain-free. A 50% or greater reduction in severity occurred in 75% of patients at 1 hour and in 95% at 3 hours. At 3 hours, 95% of the patients reported feeling better, and 60% were pain-free. Only 1 patient failed to respond to prochlorperazine.

Conclusion

Prochlorperzaine was shown to be highly effective in aborting intractable migraines in children. It was well tolerated with no significant side effects. Additional large, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to further investigate its effectiveness.

### Early intervention in migraine with sumatriptan tablets 50 mg versus 100 mg: a pooled analysis of data from six clinical trials [^81f1a45e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical trials evaluating sumatriptan in the treatment of moderate or severe migraine pain, the 50- and 100-mg doses have been comparably effective and well tolerated.

Objective

To assess the dose-efficacy relationship of sumatriptan tablets given early for mild pain, data from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-intervention studies of sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg (5 of which have been published) were pooled for analysis. These constitute all the studies conducted to date of sumatriptan tablets prospectively given early for mild pain.

Methods

The primary efficacy end point in all the studies was the proportion of patients reporting a pain-free result (ie, mild, moderate, or severe pain reduced to none) 2 hours postdose. Other efficacy end points included the proportion of patients who were migraine free (ie, no pain and no associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia) 2 hours postdose; the proportion reporting worsening of pain (ie, moderate or severe pain) 2 hours postdose; and the proportion with a sustained pain-free result (ie, pain free from 2–24 hours postdose with no use of a second dose of study medication or of rescue medication). Tolerability was assessed by evaluating the incidence of individual adverse events. The investigators assessed each adverse event's relationship to study medication.

Results

The number of patients in the intent-to-treat population was 2297 (771 sumatriptan 50 mg, 759 sumatriptan 100 mg, 767 placebo). Patients' mean age ranged from 39.4 to 39.8 years across groups, and most patients were female (90%-92%) and white (89%-90%). A pain-free result 2 hours post dose was reported by significantly more patients who took either dose of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo and by significantly more patients who took the 100-mg dose compared with the 50-mg dose (50 mg, 49%; 100 mg, 58%; placebo, 24%; P < 0.001, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). A similar pattern was observed for migraine-free results 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 42%; 100 mg, 47%; placebo, 20%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), worsening of pain 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 26%; 100 mg, 21%; placebo, 46%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), and sustained pain-free results from 2 through 24 hours postdose (50 mg, 30%; 100 mg, 35%; placebo, 12%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). Both doses of sumatriptan were well tolerated, and no dose-related trends in the incidence of individual drug-related adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

In this analysis of pooled data from 6 clinical trials, sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg administered early in a migraine attack while the pain was mild were well tolerated and significantly more effective than placebo. The 100-mg dose of sumatriptan was significantly more effective than the 50-mg dose.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For subcutaneous use only. (2.1, 2.2)
Acute treatment of migraine: 4 mg or 6 mg single dose. (2.1)
Acute treatment of cluster headache: 6 mg single dose. (2.1)
Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg. Separate doses by at least 1 hour. (2.1)
Administer dose only to the abdomen or thigh. (2.2)

DO NOT USE SUMAVEL DOSEPRO IF THE TIP OF THE DEVICE IS TITLED OR BROKEN OFF UPON REMOVAL FROM PACKAGING. (2.2)

2.1 Dosing Information

The maximum single recommended dose of Sumavel DosePro for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg given subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, a lower dose (4 mg) may be used [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of a lower dose has not been established.

The maximum cumulative injected dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, with doses of Sumavel DosePro separated by at least 1 hour. Sumavel DosePro may be given at least 1 hour following a dose of another sumatriptan product. A second dose should only be considered if some response to a first dose was observed.

2.2 Administration Using Sumavel DosePro

Sumavel DosePro is available for use as 4 mg or 6 mg needle-free delivery systems. It is intended to be given subcutaneously only. Sumavel DosePro is designed for patient self-administration to sites on the abdomen or the thigh with an adequate subcutaneous thickness to accommodate penetration of sumatriptan injection into the subcutaneous space. Administration should not be made within 2 inches of the naval. Sumavel DosePro is not to be administered to other areas of the body, including the arm.

Instruct patients on the proper use of Sumavel DosePro and direct them to use proper injection sites. Patients should be instructed not to use Sumavel DosePro if the tip of the device is tilted or broken off upon removal from packaging [see Patient counseling Information (17)].

Sumavel DosePro is for single use only. Discard after use.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-mg dose of subcutaneous sumatriptan for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^3e8f3d1b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a single 4-mg dose of sumatriptan SC for the acute treatment of adult patients experiencing a migraine attack with moderate to severe pain.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects included men and women aged 18 to 60 years who had migraine with or without aura, as defined by the 1988 International Headache Society criteria. Subjects received either sumatriptan 4 mg SC or placebo SC for a migraine attack with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity. The primary efficacy measurement was pain relief at 2 hours. Secondary efficacy measures included the severity of headache pain at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 minutes postadministration. Clinical assessments of pain severity and adverse events were made by way of questioning and observation of subjects and were completed at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 minutes postadministration.

Results

Five hundred seventy-seven subjects (87% female and 94% white) participated in this study. Three hundred eighty-four received sumatriptan and 193 received placebo. At 120 minutes postadministration, sumatriptan 4 mg SC was associated with greater proportions of patients who experienced pain relief (70% vs 22%; P < 0.001) or were pain free (50% vs 11%; P < 0.001). In addition, there were statistically significant differences between sumatriptan 4 mg SC and placebo for multiple secondary end points, including pain relief as early as 10 minutes postadministration (11% vs 6%; P = 0.039), pain-free status as early as 30 minutes postadministration (10% vs 3%; P < 0.001), nausea as early as 30 minutes postadministration (39% vs 49%; P = 0.021), and photophobia as early as 10 minutes postadministration (80% vs 87%; P = 0.046). The most common adverse events in the sumatriptan 4-mg SC and placebo groups, respectively, were injection-site reactions (43% and 15%), tingling (12% and 3%), dizziness or vertigo (10% and 5%), and warm or hot sensation (8% and 2%). Treatment groups were not statistically compared for adverse events.

Conclusions

Sumatriptan 4 mg SC was effective for the acute treatment of migraine attacks and was generally well tolerated in these patients.

---

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^8b2f59aa]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy of triptans

Efficacy data at 2 h favour eletriptan, then rizatriptan, followed by zolmitriptan over sumatriptan, almotriptan, naratriptan, and frovatriptan. At 24 h, eletriptan performed best, followed by zolmitriptan and then almotriptan, rizatriptan and sumatriptan (100 mg).

However, the most effective use of a triptan depends partly upon its route of administration. Thus, the most effective sumatriptan preparation for acute relief at 2 h (based on numbers needed to treat) was subcutaneous 6 mg, then intranasal 20 mg and then oral 100 mg formulations. While subcutaneous sumatriptan is most effective, it has more adverse events and costs more than triptans by other routes. The route of administration of the triptan is therefore best tailored to the individual's migraine attack. For example, if the migraine has a rapid onset, patients may try a fast-acting oral triptan such as rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or eletriptan, or nasal preparations that are faster still (zolmitriptan and sumatriptan); alternatively, the subcutaneous sumatriptan, which has the fastest onset of action. Other migraine features necessitate specific strategies (as outlined in figure 1).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling.

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction, Prinzmetal's Angina, Other Vasospasm- R elated Events, Arrhythmias and Cerebrovascular Events

Inform patients that Sumavel DosePro may cause serious cardiovascular side effects such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Although serious cardiovascular events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, significant rise in blood pressure, weakness, and slurring of speech and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precaution s (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8)].

Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions

Inform patients that anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving Sumavel DosePro. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of Sumavel DosePro or other triptans, particularly during combined use with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Migraine recurrence is not associated with depressive or anxiety symptoms. results of a randomized controlled trial [^158c50eb]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

In order to investigate the plausible association of migraine recurrence with anxiety and depressive symptoms, a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted using sumatriptan as a vehicle drug. Migraineurs were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg sumatriptan or placebo for three consecutive migraine attacks, and then cross over to the other treatment for three more migraine attacks. The primary measurements were the observed rate of migraine recurrence in relation to (i) patient's mood condition, measured by the Hamilton rating scales for depression and anxiety and (ii) patient's general health and functioning measured by the Symptom Checklist (SCL)-90-R. Migraine recurrence was defined as any migrainous headache that occurred within 24 h post treatment, only when pain free at 2 h was achieved. The analysis of efficacy was performed on 376 migraine attacks treated with sumatriptan and 373 attacks treated with placebo. Recurrence ratio was 14.1% and 5.1%, respectively (P = 0.045). The number needed to treat for pain free at 2 h post dose was 5.4. Recurrence was not affected by Hamilton scores for depression or anxiety, SCL-90-R scores or treatment. Apparently, depressive or anxiety symptoms do not influence headache recurrence in acute pharmaceutical migraine treatment, but further investigation is required.

### Treatment patterns in patients using triptan and prophylactic medication: an analysis of clinical practice prior to the introduction of CGRP antagonists [^ec8275e5]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triptans (selective 5HT [serotonin] receptor agonist) were recommended as gold-standard therapy in international guidelines for patients with acute migraine attacks. Since the introduction of the triptans in the early nineties, overall seven active ingredients within this therapeutic group are available as prescription drugs in most countries in Europe (including Switzerland) and in the USA: sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan. Numerous persons with acute migraine can be adequately treated by triptans alone, but a relevant proportion need prophylactic interventions, as their attacks are either very frequent or are insufficiently controlled by acute therapy. Several drugs, such as beta-blockers and others, have been shown to reduce attack frequency in some people. However, all these drugs may be connected with adverse effects, contraindications, or intolerances, and patient acceptance of these drugs is limited. Thus, specific patient populations with severe migraine are currently lacking effective therapies, and new approaches for the management of migraine therapy for these patients are needed.

Migraine affects an estimated 10% to 15% of the population with greater or lesser regularity and throughout much of their lifetime. It causes disability, be it often temporary, and strains personal relationships and professional development. Little is known about it scientifically, and its treatment remains mostly empirical. This article describes the pathogenesis of migraine, as well as its management in terms of abortive and preventive treatment.

### Diagnosis… [^979fda19]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that abortive therapy works best if taken soon after the onset of migraine or during aura, before pain progresses. A trial using almotriptan showed that early users had greater relief and lower recurrence rates of pain than non-early users. 19 Nonprescription analgesics have shown comparable effectiveness with triptans if used in adequate doses soon after headache onset. 9 Prophylactic therapy may be appropriate for selected patients. The U. S. Headache Consortium's recommended indications for prophylactic therapy in patients with migraine headache are 20: Contraindications or intolerance to abortive therapies. 8 A post-marketing study of subcutaneous sumatriptan in 12, 339 patients without ischemic heart disease revealed 36 cardiac events, only two of which occurred within 24 hours of sumatriptan use.

27 Nonetheless, if patients taking triptans develop suspected cardiac symptoms, triptans should be discontinued pending further evaluation. Cardiac evaluation is reasonable before triptan initiation in patients with multiple vascular risk factors.
28. COMBINATION TRIPTANS AND NSAIDS A fixed-dose combination of sumatriptan, 85 mg/naproxen, 500 mg is an option for acute treatment. One trial showed that the combination provided superior pain relief compared with either monotherapy. 10 Another trial found similar results in previous nonresponders to triptans. 15 Patients also may take triptans and NSAIDs concurrently. 14 Intranasal butorphanol is effective, but its use should be limited because of these concerns. 14 One study linked opiate or barbiturate use with an increased risk of episodic migraine becoming chronic. 34 Opiates or barbiturate-containing medications should be used only in patients with migraine headaches resistant to other therapies.

MENSTRUAL MIGRAINE Many women report migraine or migraine exacerbations occurring exclusively near the time of menses. Long-acting triptans frovatriptan and naratriptan, taken perimenstrually around-the-clock for short-term prevention, have been found effective in reducing frequency and severity of menstrual migraine. 39 For abortive therapy, the highest-quality evidence supports the use of sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and the NSAID mefenamic acid. 39.

### Serotonin receptor agonists in the acute treatment of migraine: a review on their therapeutic potential [^680d712f]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Current acute treatments

Triptans (5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists)

The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtype 1B/1D agonists (triptans) are nowadays the first-line acute therapy for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Since the introduction of Sumavel DosePro® (sumatriptan) in 1991, other triptan compounds with improved pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and safety were developed. They are more lipophilic than sumatriptan and consequently more capable to penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB), thereby reaching their site of action more readily. Currently, seven triptans are available; in order of release, they are as follows: sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan.

All triptans are superior to placebo and can be considered as effective and safe drugs for the vast majority of migraine patients. Despite a similar molecular structure, each triptan has its own pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Some of them have characteristics similar to sumatriptan, displaying a rapid dose-dependent efficacy with a higher risk of adverse effects (AEs), while others have a slower relieving effect on migraine symptoms but a more prolonged duration of action and less recurrence of migraine attacks.

### Abdominal migraine in adults: a review of pharmacotherapeutic options [^7f586a1d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a 32-year-old woman with abdominal migraine and present a literature review to evaluate abdominal migraine in adults, with particular regard to effective treatment.

Case Summary

A 32-year-old African American female presented with recurrent, severe abdominal pain. The patient had several previous admissions with similar symptoms and an extensive gastrointestinal workup in which findings were normal. Attacks of abdominal pain occurred despite treatment with analgesics and antiemetics. She had a family history of migraine headaches. A diagnosis of abdominal migraine was presumed and prophylactic therapy with topiramate 50 mg twice daily relieved the symptoms.

Discussion

Most published cases of adult abdominal migraine describe females who had a long history of abdominal pain refractory to conventional therapies. The majority of patients had a strong family history of migraine and reported similar episodic abdominal pain. Patients responded to prophylactic migraine therapies, including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, topiramate, and antihistamines; a few responded to abortive sumatriptan therapy.

Conclusions

Abdominal migraine should be considered a possible source of incurable abdominal pain in adults when accompanied by a complete gastrointestinal workup with normal results. We recommend a trial of topiramate as prophylactic therapy if abdominal migraine is the likely source of the pain.

WARNINGS

Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse
Cardiac Events

Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors.

It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sumatriptan PO (also known as Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Zembrace Symtouch, Sumavel Dosepro, Tosymra):
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sumatriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

 Peripheral (Small) Arteries

In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance.

 Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan's development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmaxof 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmaxfollowing a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmaxis similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the Tmaxis slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmaxafter 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose).

 Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the Cmaxand AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state.

Among N = 152 screened, 97 were eligible and 77 randomized; mean NRS changes at 1 h were 5.5 versus 5.2 (difference 0.3; 95% CI –1.0 to 1.6), and findings were similar at 2 h and 24 h; adverse events occurred in 18 of 39 (46%) prochlorperazine versus 12 of 38 (32%) metoclopramide (difference 15%; 95% CI –6% to 36%); preference to receive the same medication in future ED visits was 26 of 34 (77%) versus 27 of 37 (73%) (difference 4%; 95% CI –16% to 24%). Limitations noted imbalances in baseline characteristics with 10% more severe headache in the metoclopramide group and 10% more women, and generalizability concerns as both arms were mostly women (85% prochlorperazine, 95% metoclopramide).

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^2f93b83d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — outpatient treatment of acute episodic migraine: Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP suggests that clinicians add a triptan to acetaminophen to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Supporting evidence notes that combination therapy of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen), compared with triptan monotherapy, resulted in a higher likelihood of sustained pain relief up to 48 hours after initial treatment (130 more events per 1000 treated people) and lower likelihood of using rescue medication at 24 hours (130 fewer events per 1000 treated people).

New formulations and device

Triptans are generally effective for migraine treatment but share one problem common to all oral drugs, the delayed absorption of the drug depending on the gastric stasis that occurs during the migraine attacks. This issue has led to the development of new administration routes and devices. Two Cochrane database systematic reviews have focused on intranasal and suppository sumatriptan. Both the formulations have been effective in treating the attack, alleviating migraine-associated symptoms, and restoring functional disability.

A randomized, active-comparator, double-dummy, crossover, multi-attack study (COMPASS study) compared the efficacy and tolerability of AVP-825, a bidirectional breath-powered intranasal delivery system containing low-dose (22 mg) sumatriptan powder vs. oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Rates of pain relief and pain freedom at 2 hours and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 48 hours were similar, but at earlier time point, measured between 15 and 90 minutes, AVP-825 was superior. Nasal discomfort and abnormal taste were more common with AVP-825, while atypical sensation rates were significantly lower than with conventional sumatriptan 100 mg. A post hoc analysis found that AVP-825, compared to oral sumatriptan, led to a more rapid early reduction in overall nausea rate during the first hour, a reduced odds of nausea from 30 minutes to 2 hours following treatment, and a reduced risk of treatment-emergent nausea.

Until recently, the subcutaneous administration route was dependent upon a needle-based mechanism. A needle-free subcutaneous sumatriptan is a nitrogen pressure subcutaneous delivery system approved for the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache in the US and some European countries. A single dose of needle-free subcutaneous sumat-riptan 6 mg demonstrated bioequivalence to a single dose of traditional, needle-based subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg when delivered into the abdomen or the thigh, but not into the arm, conferring relief as early as 10 minutes after dosing, whereas oral, rectal, and intranasal routes of administration do so iñ1 hour.

In an open-label, multicenter study, sumatriptan was self-administered by patients currently treated with triptans and less than very satisfied with their acute migraine therapy. The efficacy results were consistent with those previously observed with needle-based sumatriptan, but participants experienced a statistically significant and clinically relevant increase in satisfaction with therapy and enhanced confidence in treatment after use.

### Migraine [^ad867d09]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States have migraine attacks in any given year. Migraine is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide for all ages and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians about diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and deciding when to refer the patient to a specialist.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen for acute treatment of migraine… [^20753bdc]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Patients were excluded if they had more than 6 migraine attacks monthly during either of the 2 months before screening; chronic daily headache; uncontrolled hypertension; confirmed or suspected cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease; a history of cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication or clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities that, in the investigator's opinion, contraindicated study participation; or basilar or hemiplegic migraine. Patients were instructed to treat a migraine attack with study medication when pain intensity was moderate or severe. Patients were to treat a migraine within 6 weeks of the screening visit. If a patient failed to treat a migraine within these 6 weeks, he/she was allowed to return for rescreening and given another 6 weeks to treat.

Patients were allowed to rescreen only once. Dosing regimens of migraine prophylaxis could not be changed during the 2 weeks prior to treatment, including the use of calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, β-blockers, or serotonergic medications for any other indication. A secondary efficacy outcome measure 2 hours after dosing was the percentage of patients with pain-free response. No serious adverse events attributed to study medication were reported in study 2. One serious adverse event considered probably attributed to sumatriptan monotherapy was reported in study

1. The serious adverse event was heart palpitations resulting in hospitalization of a 58-year-old woman. The patient had several cardiovascular risk factors.

The medical history included bowel obstruction, diarrhea requiring hospitalization, tension headaches, depression, and anxiety. Concurrent medications included clonazepam, venlafaxine, propoxyphene + acetaminophen, vitamins, and metformin. The screening electrocardiogram was interpreted as showing nonspecific T-wave anterior flattening of no clinical significance. After administration of sumatriptan monotherapy, the patient experienced heart palpitations and was admitted to the hospital, where she received lorazepam, aspirin, and nitroglycerin. The event was reported as resolved several days after hospitalization.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^a3447cde]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.7. Time to pain freedom

Recommendations:

1.3.4.7.1. Speed of onset of therapeutic effect can be evaluated using a survival analysis of pain freedom at time points earlier than 2 hours after treatment.

1.3.4.7.2. Time to pain freedom is a recommended secondary efficacy outcome measure.

Comments:

Time to pain freedom is a more exact measure than time to meaningful relief. Ratings of headache intensity at pre-defined time points before 2 hours (e.g. at 10- to 15-minute intervals) can be used to analyse the speed of onset of treatment response. Investigators should be aware that additional data recordings can complicate headache diaries and potentially lead to missing data.

Time-to-event analysis is the most appropriate statistical method to assess speed of onset of therapeutic effect, using no headache when pain freedom is the outcome and mild or no headache when headache relief is the outcome. The difference between two treatments should be expressed as a percentage, and because p -value calculations alone can be misleading, 95% CIs should be given in order to better inform readers about the significance of the difference. Time-to-headache relief analyses have been used in previous trials, but early response rates were relatively small. Subcutaneous sumatriptan is an exception.

1.3.4.8. Duration of attacks

Recommendation:

Duration of attacks should not be used as an efficacy measure.

Comments:

The duration of a migraine attack can be influenced by the effect of treatment, as well as by physiological factors (e.g. sleep) and external variables (e.g. use of rescue medication beyond 2 hours). Since these variables cannot be controlled for in a clinical trial, they prevent an accurate and scientifically sound interpretation of the independent effect of an investigational intervention. The robustness of the pain freedom and sustained pain freedom outcome measures mitigates the need for attack duration as an efficacy measure.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of the safety and efficacy of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine [^429b0b44]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Zolmitriptan has been formulated for delivery using ADAM as an investigational product for acute migraine treatment. In a Phase 1 study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan delivered with ADAM, the median time to maximum serum concentration (t max) was less than 20 minutes, which was comparable to subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in the same study. Absorption was considerably faster than for oral zolmitriptan, with higher exposure in the first two hours. These data suggested that ADAM zolmitriptan may provide a promising new option for providing rapid migraine relief while circumventing some of the limitations of other routes of administration.

Here we describe a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating ascending doses of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine headache and associated symptoms.
