## Question

pregabalin in trigeminal neuralgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pregabalin's role in trigeminal neuralgia, including its regulatory status, mechanism, efficacy, safety, dosing, place in guidelines, and practical prescribing recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether pregabalin is FDA-approved for trigeminal neuralgia. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and whether it plausibly maps to TN pathophysiology. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for efficacy, including response rates and predictors. After that, I need to examine safety and tolerability, including dose-related adverse effects. Then, I should confirm dosing strategies and titration. Next, I will compare pregabalin's placement in contemporary guidelines relative to first-line agents. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing recommendations and a bottom-line conclusion, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending the indication. Pregabalin is FDA-approved for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures; it is not FDA-approved for trigeminal neuralgia, so any use in TN is off-label and should be framed as such in counseling and documentation [^112WSeSg] [^113G3XNY].

> Now, I will examine the mechanism of action and see if it aligns with TN biology. Pregabalin binds the α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx and presynaptic neurotransmitter release, thereby dampening neuronal hyperexcitability; this calcium-channel modulation is mechanistically relevant to neuropathic pain states, including those with ectopic firing, which is pertinent to TN pathophysiology, though TN's paroxysmal, triggerable attacks also reflect demyelination and ephaptic coupling that sodium channel blockade targets more directly [^115qhXt5] [^113aNB2p].

> Next, I should review the clinical efficacy data in TN specifically, and I need to be careful about study quality. The most informative TN-specific study is a prospective open-label cohort of 53 patients showing that after 8 weeks of pregabalin 150–600 mg/day, 74% improved, with 25% achieving complete pain relief and 49% achieving more than 50% pain reduction; patients without concomitant chronic facial pain responded better than those with it, suggesting comorbid persistent pain predicts poorer outcomes, but I should emphasize the open-label design and lack of placebo control when interpreting these results [^114KxMom]. Observational primary care data in 65 pregabalin-naïve TN patients reported a 59.4% responder rate at 12 weeks with meaningful improvements in sleep, anxiety/depression, and disability, but again, the absence of a control group limits causal inference, so I should not overstate efficacy here [^115Fxp9i]. Broader neuropathic pain literature shows pregabalin's efficacy in PHN and DPN with dose-dependent response and NNTs around 4–5 for 50% pain reduction, which supports biologic plausibility but does not substitute for TN-specific RCTs, and indeed there are no published RCTs of pregabalin in classic TN to date [^111dyx2h] [^112gecri].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and tolerability because this often drives real-world use. Pregabalin commonly causes somnolence and dizziness, with dose-related increases; pooled neuropathic pain trials show somnolence around 16–25% and dizziness around 29–35% at 300–600 mg/day, and discontinuation for adverse events occurs in roughly 18–28% at higher doses, which is clinically relevant when targeting 600 mg/day in TN; additional concerns include peripheral edema, weight gain, blurred vision, cognitive slowing, and rare thrombocytopenia, and dependence risk has prompted scheduling in some regions, so I need to screen for fall risk, renal function, and substance use history before prescribing [^111dyx2h] [^111PTkY9] [^114QS4jS].

> I will now examine dosing and titration, and I should double-check whether flexible dosing improves outcomes. Typical practice is to start at 150 mg/day in divided doses and titrate by 150 mg every 3–7 days based on response and tolerability toward a target of 300–600 mg/day; flexible-dose analyses in neuropathic pain suggest that many apparent nonresponders at lower doses will respond with further titration, so I should avoid prematurely labeling a patient refractory before reaching 600 mg/day if tolerated, while monitoring for sedation and dizziness at each step [^112znau4] [^114XQPwE]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought the FDA-labeled maximum for pregabalin was 300 mg/day, but that is incorrect; for PHN the labeled maximum is 600 mg/day, and while this is not an TN indication, it supports the clinical practice of titrating up to 600 mg/day when appropriate, with renal dose adjustments for CrCl < 60 mL/min [^117CdHoR].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my recommendations align with consensus. Contemporary European Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine as first-line for TN, with lamotrigine or gabapentin as reasonable alternatives; pregabalin is listed among agents that may be used as monotherapy or add-on, but it is not prioritized over lamotrigine or gabapentin, reflecting the weaker evidence base and lack of RCTs in TN; AAFP guidance similarly prioritizes carbamazepine as initial therapy, reinforcing pregabalin's second-line or adjunctive role [^113JHHEi] [^113JHHEi] [^115q3b6S]. I should confirm that this applies to secondary TN as well; EAN notes that secondary TN is generally managed similarly to primary TN, so pregabalin remains a second-line option in that context too [^114N7sXB].

> Let me consider special populations and predictors of response, and I need to check whether any modifiers change the calculus. In carbamazepine-refractory TN, small series suggest pregabalin can still help about half of patients, with older age predicting better response in one analysis, but these are low-quality data and should be framed cautiously. Conversely, in post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain after neuroablative procedures, a retrospective cohort found only about 28% responded to pregabalin monotherapy, with longer disease duration and higher anxiety/depression scores predicting poorer response, so expectations should be tempered in that phenotype [^111PTkY9] [^1156tLXZ]. For patients with MS-related TN, EAN includes pregabalin among second-line options alongside lamotrigine and gabapentin, acknowledging limited direct evidence and the need to individualize based on comorbidities and tolerability [^1157rHb8].

> I should now translate this into practical prescribing steps, and I will double-check each element against the evidence. Before initiating pregabalin, confirm the diagnosis of TN with appropriate imaging to exclude secondary causes and document baseline pain scores and triggers; start at 150 mg/day in two or three divided doses, increase by 150 mg every 3–7 days toward 300–600 mg/day as tolerated, with earlier reassessment at 1–2 weeks to capture early responders; monitor for dizziness, somnolence, gait instability, edema, weight gain, and visual symptoms; adjust dose for renal impairment; and if partial response occurs, consider combination with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine rather than switching abruptly, given the frequent need for polytherapy in refractory cases [^113aNB2p] [^112znau4] [^117CdHoR]. But wait, what if the patient is on a sedative regimen already? I need to ensure additive CNS depression is anticipated and managed, sometimes by slower titration or bedtime dosing, to mitigate falls and cognitive effects [^111dyx2h].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Pregabalin is a reasonable off-label option for TN when first-line sodium channel blockers are ineffective or poorly tolerated, with expected response rates around 50–60% in open-label TN cohorts and meaningful improvements in sleep and function, but it lacks TN-specific RCTs and carries dose-related CNS adverse effects that limit titration in some patients; therefore, it should be positioned after carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, alongside lamotrigine and gabapentin, with shared decision-making about uncertain magnitude of benefit and the need for careful monitoring during dose escalation [^114KxMom] [^115Fxp9i] [^113tor51] [^111dyx2h].

---

Pregabalin is a **second-line option** [^113tor51] for trigeminal neuralgia when carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are ineffective or not tolerated [^112gecri]. It reduces neuronal excitability via α2δ-1 calcium channel blockade [^115qhXt5], with typical dosing of 150–600 mg/day in divided doses [^117CdHoR]. Clinical studies show **moderate efficacy** [^114KxMom], with about 50–60% of patients achieving ≥ 50% pain reduction, but high-quality RCTs are lacking [^112znau4]. Common adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, and edema; monitor for CNS effects, suicidal ideation, and renal impairment [^111dyx2h] [^111PTkY9]. Pregabalin is not first-line and should be considered after carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, with surgery if medical therapy fails [^113JHHEi].

---

## Mechanism of action

Pregabalin binds the α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx and **neurotransmitter release** (glutamate, norepinephrine, substance P), thereby decreasing neuronal excitability and hyperalgesia [^115qhXt5].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in trigeminal neuralgia

- **Open-label study**: 53 patients; 74% improved after 8 weeks (25% complete relief, 49% > 50% reduction); mean dose 269.8 mg/day [^114KxMom].
- **Primary care study**: 65 patients; 59.4% achieved ≥ 50% pain reduction; significant improvements in sleep, anxiety/depression, and quality of life [^115Fxp9i].
- **Carbamazepine-refractory TN**: 33 patients; 48.5% improved; older age predicted response [^111PTkY9].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Initial dose**: 75 mg twice daily (150 mg/day) [^117CdHoR].
- **Titration**: Increase to 150 mg twice daily (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on response and tolerability [^notfound].
- **Maximum dose**: 600 mg/day in divided doses [^117CdHoR].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose for creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, weight gain, dry mouth, blurred vision [^notfound].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Suicidal ideation, angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions, renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Discontinuation**: Taper gradually to minimize withdrawal seizures and anxiety [^notfound].

## Comparison with other anticonvulsants

| **Attribute** | **Carbamazepine** | **Oxcarbazepine** | **Pregabalin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | High (first-line) [^113tor51] | High (first-line) [^113tor51] | Moderate (second-line) [^115VS6Q2] |
| Adverse effects | Serious (hepatotoxicity, hyponatremia) [^113afwB2] | Moderate (hyponatremia, dizziness) [^113afwB2] | Moderate (dizziness, somnolence, edema) [^111dyx2h] |
| Monitoring | CBC, LFTs, sodium | Sodium | Renal function, mood |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

EAN 2019 recommends carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine as **first-line**; pregabalin is a **second-line** option when first-line agents are ineffective or not tolerated [^113tor51] [^113JHHEi]. AAFP 2025 similarly recommends carbamazepine as **initial therapy**, with pregabalin as an alternative when needed [^115q3b6S].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Pregabalin is appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, including those with **multiple sclerosis** [^1157rHb8] or **secondary trigeminal neuralgia** [^113JHHEi]. It is also useful as **add-on therapy** for partial responders to first-line agents [^113JHHEi].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **RCTs**: High-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking [^112znau4].
- **Long-term data**: Limited evidence on durability and relapse [^115VS6Q2].
- **Comparative studies**: Head-to-head trials with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine are needed [^114Mgqoe].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Start low**: Begin at 75 mg twice daily and titrate to effect [^117CdHoR].
- **Monitor**: Watch for dizziness, somnolence, edema, mood changes, and renal function [^111dyx2h].
- **Combine**: Consider add-on therapy if monotherapy is insufficient [^113JHHEi].
- **Refer**: Consider surgery if medical therapy fails or is not tolerated [^111xxBZQ].

---

Pregabalin is a **moderately effective second-line option** for trigeminal neuralgia, useful when first-line agents fail or are not tolerated. It offers a favorable safety profile but requires monitoring for CNS and renal effects; high-quality RCTs are still needed to define its role more precisely [^112gecri].

### The evidence for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^114BTr2o]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on neuropathic pain treatment are accumulating, so an updated review of the available evidence is needed. Studies were identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) values were used to compare the efficacy and safety of different treatments for a number of neuropathic pain conditions. One hundred and seventy-four studies were included, representing a 66% increase in published randomized, placebo-controlled trials in the last 5 years. Painful poly-neuropathy (most often due to diabetes) was examined in 69 studies, postherpetic neuralgia in 23, while peripheral nerve injury, central pain, HIV neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia were less often studied. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, and opioids are the drug classes for which there is the best evidence for a clinical relevant effect. Despite a 66% increase in published trials only a limited improvement of neuropathic pain treatment has been obtained. A large proportion of neuropathic pain patients are left with insufficient pain relief. This fact calls for other treatment options to target chronic neuropathic pain. Large-scale drug trials that aim to identify possible subgroups of patients who are likely to respond to specific drugs are needed to test the hypothesis that a mechanism-based classification may help improve treatment of the individual patients.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^114QS4jS]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, a review and meta-analysis of Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin were conducted to assess the benefits and harms of pregabalin. The rationale for the analysis was based on increasing evidence of pregabalin's potential for abuse and reports of increased mortality, leading the UK government to reclassify the drug as a class C controlled substance. While pregabalin was associated with significant benefits on pain reduction and sleep interference, it was also associated with a significant increase in the risk of adverse events (AEs) compared with placebo (relative risk 1.33 [95% CI 1.23–1.44]; p < 0.00001), translating into an absolute effect of 145 more AEs per 1000 patients treated with pregabalin. Although 23 of the 28 studies included in the meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of pregabalin for the treatment of PNP, there are still insufficient good-quality randomized controlled trials of pregabalin in PNP.

Regarding surgical interventions for trigeminal neuralgia, more specifically with respect to surgical interventions, EAN 2019 guidelines recommend to offer surgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia after medical management. Offer surgery for patients with trigeminal neuralgia if the pain is not sufficiently controlled medically or if medical treatment is poorly tolerated and inform of the possibility at an early stage.

### Outcomes and predictors of response to pregabalin for the treatment of post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain following neuroablative procedures: a retrospective observational study [^1156tLXZ]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain (PTNP) following trigeminal neuralgia (TN)-related neuroablative procedures is relatively rare. Due to the fear of debilitating complications, its treatment has been generally suboptimal. Pregabalin (PGB) has been reported to relieve neuropathic pain. However, the potential role of PGB and the predictors of response of PGB use as a strategy in the treatment of PTNP following TN-related neuroablative procedures have not been identified yet.

Objectives

To report the efficacy and safety of PGB and the identification of predictors of PGB for PTNP following TN-related neuroablative procedures.

Study Design

Monocentric, retrospective, observational study.

Setting

This study consecutively enrolled patients with PTNP following TN-related neuroablative procedures who were prescribed PGB at Beijing Tiantan Hospital.

Methods

From January 2018 to June 2022, a total of 112 patients were included in this study, of whom 10 were excluded because of incomplete follow-up data and side effects immediately after taking PGB. Final analysis included 102 patients. Demographic data, pain-related baseline data, efficacy of patients with PTNP after one month of PGB evaluated by the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) scores for pain, and side effects of PGB were extracted and analyzed. The predictors of pain-relieving effects of PGB were identified by logistic regression analysis.

Results

Within one month after the use of PGB alone, 29 out of the 102 (28.4%) patients achieved pain relief with a significant reduction in the BNI scores (P < 0.01). All of the 73 patients who did not respond to PGB monotherapy either switched to other medications (n = 8) or combined additional oral medications to the existing PGB therapy (n = 65). The main side effect of PGB in our study was dizziness. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that longer disease durations (Adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.72, P = 0.000) and higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores (Adjusted OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.87, P = 0.022) were poor predictors of response to PGB.

Limitations

This was a retrospective observational study. Long-term efficacy and safety of PGB in the treatment of PTNP patients were not evaluated.

Conclusions

This study confirms that PGB monotherapy is not a very effective treatment for PTNP following TN-related neuroablative procedures. PGB was more beneficial in patients with shorter disease durations and lower HADS scores.

Key Words

Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain, efficacy, safety, predictor of response, pregabalin.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^117B1nY4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms which last from a few seconds to 2 minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, gabapentin, lamotrigine, microvascular decompression, nerve block, oxcarbazepine, peripheral acupuncture, phenytoin, proparacaine eye drops, sodium valproate, stereotactic radiosurgery, tizanidine, and topiramate.

### Efficacy and safety of crisugabalin (HSK16149) in adults with postherpetic neuralgia: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^111TkwCw]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

This randomized clinical trial lacks an active comparator arm and does not reflect the standard of care in the US or Europe where an oral tricyclic antidepressant, pregabalin, and the lidocaine, 5%, patch are recommended as first-line therapies. Caution should be exercised to interpret how these results would guide the standard of care. It also remains to be investigated whether these findings are applicable to the global population given that the current study population is limited to Chinese patients. Future trials that include patient populations of different countries or ethnicities and with head-to-head comparators for crisugabalin in monotherapy or combination therapy are required to provide robust evidence for the role of crisugabalin in the global management of NPN. This trial also excluded patients who did not respond to prior treatment with pregabalin (≥ 300 mg/d) or gabapentin (≥ 1200 mg/d). Therefore, the benefit observed with crisugabalin for PHN may not apply to this subset of patients. Furthermore, the study only provided short-term (26 weeks) efficacy and safety data of crisugabalin. An open-label, single-arm study of the long-term (52 weeks) safety and efficacy of crisugabalin for peripheral NPN was completed and the results are to be reported. The results of the phase 2/3 trial on diabetic peripheral NPN will also be available soon. The findings from these trials are expected to provide greater granularity in guiding the management of NPN with crisugabalin.

### Patient-reported outcomes in subjects with neuropathic pain receiving pregabalin: evidence from medical practice in primary care settings [^113k5Gmb]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of pregabalin on different patient-reported outcomes in subjects with neuropathic pain treated under usual medical practice conditions in primary care settings.

Patients and Methods

Secondary analysis of a 12-week, multicenter, naturalistic, and prospective study on 18 years of age or older patients of both genders with chronic pain (of at least 6 months) due to diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic, or trigeminal neuralgia refractory to the previous analgesic treatment (at least one drug).

Subjects

Assessed at baseline and end of the study visits by the following questionnaires: Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sheehan Disability Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and EQ-5D.

Results

The analysis included 1,354 patients not previously exposed to pregabalin; 598 patients (44%) received monotherapy with pregabalin as a substitute of the previous treatment, in 589 patients (44%) pregabalin was added to the existing therapy, and the treatment schedule of the other 167 patients (12%) did not include pregabalin. After 12 weeks of treatment, significant improvements in all effectiveness assessments were observed in all of the three groups, these being significantly greater in the groups receiving pregabalin, with large effect sizes in most health outcome measures.

Conclusion

Under usual medical practice conditions, patients with chronic pain of peripheral neuropathic origin receiving pregabalin both in monotherapy and as add-on therapy showed substantial improvements in severity of pain and in the spectrum of associated symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, mood disorders, disability, and health-related quality of life. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### EFNS guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain: 2010 revision [^114Ngvak]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This second European Federation of Neurological Societies Task Force aimed at updating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain since 2005.

Methods

Studies were identified using the Cochrane Database and Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed; lower class studies were considered only in conditions that had no top-level studies. Treatments administered using repeated or single administrations were considered, provided they are feasible in an outpatient setting.

Results

Most large RCTs included patients with diabetic polyneuropathies and post-herpetic neuralgia, while an increasing number of smaller studies explored other conditions. Drugs generally have similar efficacy in various conditions, except in trigeminal neuralgia, chronic radiculopathy and HIV neuropathy, with level A evidence in support of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), pregabalin, gabapentin, tramadol and opioids (in various conditions), duloxetine, venlafaxine, topical lidocaine and capsaicin patches (in restricted conditions). Combination therapy appears useful for TCA-gabapentin and gabapentin-opioids (level A).

Conclusions

There are still too few large-scale comparative studies. For future trials, we recommend to assess comorbidities, quality of life, symptoms and signs with standardized tools and attempt to better define responder profiles to specific drug treatments.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for postherpetic neuralgia in Chinese and international patients [^112tm3WL]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain condition that arises in response to acute herpes zoster infection. The reported incidence of PHN ranges from 5% to 30% of infected adults–and increases with age.–PHN-related pain negatively affects sleep as well as reducing quality of life, physical and social functioning, and psychological well-being.–

Pregabalin is an α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligand indicated globally for the treatment of PHN-related pain, including in the USAand across Europe. The efficacy and safety of pregabalin for PHN have been demonstrated in multiple international clinical trials.–In these trials, pregabalin statistically significantly improved pain and disrupted sleep versus placebo, and patients were more likely to report a 30% or 50% improvement in pain, and global improvement, with pregabalin over placebo.–However, few patients in these international trials were Asian or of Asian origin. More recently, clinical trials on pregabalin efficacy and safety for PHN have been conducted specifically in Chinese patients. In these Chinese trials, pregabalin also statistically significantly improved pain and disrupted sleep versus placebo, and patients were more likely to report a 30% improvement in pain, or global improvement, with pregabalin over placebo. Pregabalin is also indicated for PHN-related pain in China. Although pregabalin is minimally metabolized and therefore there is no reason to anticipate that its effectiveness would be different in different patient populations, whether the efficacy and safety profiles of pregabalin are similar in Chinese and international patient populations has not been tested. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in Chinese patients with PHN with an international patient population with PHN. The impact of baseline pain severity on efficacy responses in the two patient groups was also examined.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115ZxHJz]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain.

Purpose

To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?

Methods

Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

Conclusions

In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain.

### Pregabalin and gabapentin in matched patients with peripheral neuropathic pain in routine medical practice in a primary care setting: findings from a cost-consequences analysis in a nested case-control study [^113D5yM9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pregabalin and gabapentin are marketed to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, but head-to-head comparison is lacking.

Objectives

The aims of this work were to compare the effects of pregabalin and gabapentin on different patient-reported health outcomes and to analyze health care and nonhealth-care resource consumption and their related costs among patients treated for peripheral neuropathic pain in primary medical care.

Methods

A cost-consequences comparison in subjects with refractory (suboptimal response to ≥ 1 previous analgesic treatment for > 6 months) chronic peripheral neuropathic pain was carried out using data extracted from two 12-week, observational, prospective studies in primary medical care. Patients were eligible if they were aged ≥ 18 years, had a score of ≥ 4 on the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire, and were able to complete health questionnaires written in Spanish. A nested-paired case-control design was chosen to perform the comparison with 2 controls (pregabalin) per case (gabapentin) matched by age, sex, peripheral neuropathic pain condition, time since diagnosis, number of previous treatments, pain intensity, depressive and anxiety symptom scores, and health state. Adult subjects with refractory chronic pain because of diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic or trigeminal neuralgias, or cervical or lumbosacral radiculopathies were included. Epidemiologic statistical methods were applied for comparing health effects (pain intensity, sleep, anxiety and depressive symptoms, disability, and health state), resources utilization, and related cost variations after 12 weeks. Indirect costs were measured by means of lost-workday equivalent calculations multiplied by the mean national daily salary.

Results

Analysis included 44 patients treated with gabapentin (cases) and 88 patients treated with pregabalin (controls) who were matched for age, sex, and other parameters. The mean (SD) gabapentin and pregabalin doses were 1263 (540) and 202 (119) mg/d, respectively. Although there was a greater reduction in last-week mean pain intensity with pregabalin (visual analog scale: 39.1 [22.5] vs 28.0 [22.2] mm; P = 0.008), as well as more patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in pain rate (60.9% vs 40.5%; P = 0.029), there were no significant differences between groups for sensory, affective, total, or present pain intensity. The significantly higher drug cost associated with pregabalin was offset by a greater reduction in productivity costs compared with gabapentin, yielding similar cost reduction (-euro1254 [1479] vs -euro1384 [2874], respectively; P = NS).

Conclusion

Pregabalin appeared to be associated with greater reduction in mean weekly intensity of pain, but there were no significant differences in cost.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^116zHo7R]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The 30 and 50% responder status was defined for each patient based on the percentage change in the MPS from baseline to each week, 1–15. Overall, there were more pregabalin 30% and 50% pain responders when compared with the placebo group. The incidence of responders generally increased over the first 3 weeks of treatment for both 30 and 50% responders. Responder data for weeks 1–3, 14, and 15 are summarized for brevity (responder percentage [week, number responders/number observed at week, p value pregabalin vs placebo]). Pregabalin 30% responders were 11.9% (week 1, 31/260; p = 0.0028), 27.2% (week 2, 69/254; p = 0.0360), 38.9% (week 3, 98/252; p = 0.0235), 57.4% (week 14, 128/223; p = 0.4245), and 57.7% (week 15, 113/196; p = 0.8464). Placebo 30% responders were 5.0% (week 1, 13/258), 20.1% (week 2, 49/244), 30.2% (week 3, 74/245), 54.3% (week 14, 113/208), and 58.3% (week 15, 109/187). Pregabalin 50% responders were 4.6% (week 1, 12/260; p = 0.1633), 11.4% (week 2, 29/254; p = 0.0652), 22.6% (week 3, 57/252; p = 0.0039), 37.7% (week 14, 84/223; p = 0.0314), and 39.8% (week 15, 78/196; p = 0.1889). Placebo 50% responders were 2.3% (week 1, 6/258), 7.0% (week 2, 17/244), 13.5% (week 3, 33/245), 29.8% (week 14, 62/208), and 34.2% (week 15, 64/187). Differences were statistically significant for pregabalin compared with placebo (p < 0.05, generalized linear model) for 30% responders at weeks 1–3, and for 50% responders at weeks 3–5, 7, 9, and 11–14. In the BPI-sf mean pain severity index, a statistically significant change from baseline to week 15 favored pregabalin over placebo (p = 0.0050; ANCOVA). The LS mean (standard error) change was − 2.40 (0.13) in the pregabalin group and − 1.95 (0.13) in the placebo group. In the mean pain interference index, a statistically significant change from baseline also favored pregabalin over placebo (p = 0.0168) (Table 2).

### Pharmacologic management part 1: better-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114Mgqoe]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain impacts millions of people in the United States and around the world. Patients experience one of many symptoms, such as pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, for many years because of unavailable or inadequate treatment. One of the major challenges in treating patients with neuropathic pain syndromes is a lack of consensus concerning the appropriate first-line treatment options for conditions associated with neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia. This review summarizes the published results of randomized trials involving treatment for neuropathic pain conditions. Anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, and tricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline and desipramine, have demonstrated efficacy in relieving pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia, in several studies. However, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies of these agents limits the conclusions that can be reached. Clinicians who must make decisions regarding the care of individual patients may find some guidance from the number of randomized trials with a positive outcome for each agent. Using quality-of-life study outcomes, treatment strategies must encompass the impact of therapeutic agents on the comorbid conditions of sleep disturbance and mood and anxiety disorders associated with neuropathic pain. Looking to the future, emerging therapies, such as pregabalin and newer N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor blockers, may provide physicians and patients with new treatment options for more effective relief of pain.

### Drug treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: a systematic review of the literature [^112N27UJ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study undertook a systematic review of the literature on drug treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

Methods

An electronic search was carried out for articles published between January 1960 to February 2005. Studies with high level of evidence were included. The levels of evidence of the articles were classified after the guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Results

Of 770 publications, only 21 publications showed a high level of evidence (6 randomized controlled trials and 15 clinical trials/controlled clinical trials), with a total of 348 patients. A total of 749 publications were not included in the review as they showed a low level of evidence.

Conclusions

Anticonvulsants are effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia; however, few studies with high levels of evidence were found. It is quite difficult to compare or even combine their outcomes in a scientifically meaningful manner. Due to insufficient research data, there is a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials in this area of medicine.

14.1 Management of Postherpetic Neuralgia (Study PHN CR)

Support for efficacy of LYRICA CR for the management of PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was based on the efficacy of LYRICA for these indications along with an adequate and well‑controlled study in adults with PHN. This 19‑week randomized withdrawal study compared daily doses of LYRICA CR 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 247.5 mg, 330 mg, 495 mg, or 660 mg with placebo. Those enrolled were required to have pain present for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash and a baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on the numeric rating scale (NRS)‑Pain (assessed over a 1 week recall period). The baseline mean pain scores were 6.83 for LYRICA CR‑treated patients vs. 6.85 for placebo‑treated patients. A total of 82.4% of patients completed the single‑blind phase of the study. Patients were considered responders if they had at least a 50% reduction in pain in the single‑blind phase. Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double‑blind phase to treatment with either the LYRICA CR dose achieved in the single‑blind phase or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 months following randomization. A total of 87.5% of LYRICA CR‑treated patients and 78% of placebo‑treated patients completed the double-blind phase of the study.

LYRICA CR treatment demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the endpoint change in mean pain score from baseline compared to placebo. For a range of levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. In the LYRICA CR group, 79.8% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 73.6% at least 50% improvement in pain intensity. In the placebo group, 64.9% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 54.6% at least a 50% improvement in pain intensity.

14.2 Management of Fibromyalgia (Study FM CR)

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of LYRICA CR in adults with fibromyalgia failed to demonstrate efficacy.

Pregabalin

Pregabalin is similar to gabapentin in that it is also a GABA analog that inhibits the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and reduces neurotransmitter release. Compared to gabapentin, however, pregabalin exhibits improved absorption and pharmacokinetic profiles. Hamasaki et al studied pregabalin in 33 patients with carbamazepine-refractory TN, with 48.5% of patients reporting improved pain. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated that among all the clinical variables considered, older age was significantly associated with effectiveness of pregabalin treatment. Obermann et al studied 53 patients with TN with or without chronic facial pain and found that 39 (74%) patients improved after 8 weeks. Patients without chronic facial pain were statistically more likely to respond, p = 0.02. Rustagi et al demonstrated in a trial of 22 patients that uses pregabalin or lamotrigine in addition to carbamazepine had equal improvement in pain control; however, patients on pregabalin had fewer side effects. Side effects of pregabalin are similar to those of gabapentin, including sedation and dizziness, and lower extremity edema. In rare cases, patients have been seen to develop thrombocytopenia.

Clonazepam

Clonazepam is a highly potent and long-acting benzodiazepine that acts as a positive allosteric modulator on GABA-A receptors. Trialed in 30 patients that were refractory to carbamazepine in 1975, 40% had complete control of neuralgia and 23.3% were significantly helped by the drug. Dosing, however, averaged 6 mg to 8 mg per day, and 80–88% of the patients experienced somnolence and unsteady gait. Side effects of clonazepam include sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and risk for dementia with long-term use. Patients can also experience a paradoxical reaction and become agitated and behave aggressively.

Valproate

Valproate is an anticonvulsant that mediates its effects through blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased levels of GABA. Peiris et al administered valproate to 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Six out of 20 patients had no attacks for 6–18 months while, in 3 patients, the frequency and severity of attacks were reduced by at least 50%. In the United States, valproate contains black box warnings for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and fetal malformations. Most commonly people experience weight gain, hair loss, and nausea. Patients may also develop thrombocytopenia or abnormal ammonia levels and elevated liver function tests.

Results

Patient population

A total of 889 patients were treated with flexible-dose pregabalin; 761 of which met the inclusion criteria (≥ 80% compliance on pregabalin, had remained in their study for ≥ 28 days, and receiving a stable dose of pregabalin for ≥ 4 days) and were included in the descriptive analysis. Of these, 717 could be grouped into one of the six established dose response pathways. The demographic characteristics and baseline clinical characteristics of patients were broadly similar regardless of treatment compliance (Table 1).

Anticonvulsants

Gabapentin, a first-line agent for neuropathic pain, exerts its effect by inhibiting the α 2 δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, thereby reducing neuronal excitability. However, studies evaluating gabapentin's role in CRPS are limited. Van de Vusse et al conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 58 patients with CRPS I. They found that gabapentin produced mild pain relief and significantly improved sensory deficits in the affected limb. In a prospective study by Tan et al, 22 patients with CRPS received an initial gabapentin dose of 600 mg/day, which was titrated until adequate pain control was achieved. The results confirmed gabapentin's efficacy in pain reduction, although it did not affect other CRPS symptoms. Pregabalin, sharing a mechanism similar to gabapentin, is widely used in clinical settings; however, its effectiveness in CRPS is supported only by case reports.

Carbamazepine, a first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels to prevent repetitive neuronal firing. In an RCT by Harke et al, 22 patients with CRPS I who had previously responded to spinal cord stimulation were administered 600 mg/day of carbamazepine for 8 days while stimulation was paused. The results suggested modest analgesic benefits. Oxcarbazepine, a derivative of carbamazepine with a similar mechanism but fewer adverse effects, has not yet been evaluated in patients with CRPS.

Clinical evidence supporting the use of anticonvulsants in CRPS remains limited, underscoring the need for further robust research to establish their efficacy.

Drugs Enhancing Descending Inhibitory Activity

Antidepressants, including TCAs and SNRIs, enhance descending inhibitory pain pathways by inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake at the presynaptic membrane. However, research on their effectiveness in CRPS is limited. Brown et al conducted an RCT including 34 patients aged 7–18 years with CRPS I or neuropathic pain, randomly assigning them to receive either 10 mg amitriptyline or 300 mg gabapentin. Both drugs significantly reduced pain intensity and improved sleep, with no significant difference between them in pain relief or sleep outcomes.TCAs and SNRIs are established agents in neuropathic pain management. Moreover, antidepressants can offer dual benefits in CRPS, as psychiatric comorbidities are common in these patients. The α2-adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine, enhance descending inhibition by stimulating presynaptic α2-receptors in the central nervous system. This inhibitory action reduces excitatory neurotransmitter release and attenuates pain signal transmission at the spinal cord level.

Cation-Channel Blockers

Drugs that block entry of sodium or calcium into neurons reduce their action potentials. Most often used as anticonvulsants, several have efficacy in neuropathic pain documented in large RCTs, meta-analysis and systematic reviews (level 1 evidence). Gabapentin, first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, came to the attention of pain specialists in an anecdotal report of efficacy for CRPS. It works at the alpha(2)-delta auxiliary subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels and well-powered large RCTs have demonstrated its efficacy, in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (level 2 evidence). A case series in adults and one pediatric case report suggest efficacy in CRPS (level 4 evidence). The only RCT of gabapentin in CRPS (level 2) was "negative", however it used a sub-maximal dose (1800 mg/day). As gabapentin neared the end of its patent-protection a large pharmaceutical firm developed a closely-related compound, pregabalin, with essentially the same mode of action. Its major advantage is that some patients can manage with twice-daily dosing, but relative cost should be considered when deciding between the two [level 2] There are no clinical trial data evaluating pregabalin for CRPS.

Carbamazepine has a traditional place in the treatment of neuropathic pain, and is FDA-approved for trigeminal neuralgia. One preliminary RCT with an experimental design that included several patients with CRPS responsive to spinal cord stimulator treatment (and the SCS off) indicated that 600 mg/day of carbamazepine, taken over 8 days, had some analgesic efficacy. Oxcarbazepine is a similar anticonvulsant that often replaces carbamazepine because it has fewer serious adverse effects (specifically bone-marrow suppression or liver failure); headaches, dizziness, and nausea are the most common adverse effects of oxcarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine has not been studied specifically in CRPS. Phenytoin is an older agent (with many side effects) sometimes considered in neuropathic pain especially in cases that involve "ectopic nerve firing" (level 2), but there are no reported outcomes in CRPS. RCTs for lamotrigine have studied its effects on other neuropathic conditions, but not CRPS. There is anecdotal evidence (level 4) for efficacy of a variety of other anti-convulsants/neuro-modulators (levetiracetam, topiramate) in CRPS, but no compelling clinical trial evidence supporting their use at this time.

VAS Score, PSQI Score and Pregabalin Dosage

The initial visual analog scale (VAS) scores at T0 for the six patients were recorded as (8.5 ± 0.2). After a 24-week follow-up, the patients' VAS scores had decreased to 2.67. In addition, there were significant reductions in VAS scores at all postoperative periods (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) compared to the preoperative period T0 (P < 0.01), indicating a noteworthy decrease in pain intensity (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Changes in PSQI and VAS scores of patients over different periods. Repeated-measures ANOVA test, P < 0.01.

Furthermore, the patients' preoperative Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score was reported as (13.7 ± 1.0). At the final 24-week postoperative follow-up, the PSQI score had decreased to (5.2 ± 1.0) for the six patients. Moreover, there was a consistent downward trend in PSQI scores at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively, with significant differences compared to the preoperative period (P < 0.01). This indicates a substantial improvement in sleep quality (Figure 3).

In this study, the dosages of pregabalin administered to patients were examined. The average preoperative dosage of pregabalin was 300 mg per day, and there was no alteration in medication dosage at the 1-week postoperative stage. However, notable reductions in pregabalin dosage were observed during the postoperative periods T2, T3, T4, and T5, indicating significant disparities in comparison to the preoperative phase T0 (P < 0.01). Further information can be found in Figure 4.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^115qhXt5]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of action of pregabalin is not completely understood, but it is an antagonist of voltage-gated calcium ion channels and is thought to bind to the alpha-2-delta subunit. This action is thought to reduce the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P, reducing neuronal excitability and alleviating allodynia and hyperalgesia. Pregabalin is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed from the intestines, with ~90% bioavailability. It is excreted almost exclusively via the kidneys. It is also known to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia [^114KxMom]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

This prospective, open-label study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin treatment in patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia with and without concomitant facial pain. Fifty-three patients with trigeminal neuralgia (14 with concomitant chronic facial pain) received pregabalin (PGB) 150–600 mg daily and were prospectively followed for 1 year. The primary outcome was number of patients pain free or with reduction of pain intensity by > 50% and of attack frequency by > 50% after 8 weeks. Secondary outcome was sustained pain relief after 1 year. Thirty-nine patients (74%) improved after 8 weeks with a mean dose of 269.8 mg/day (range 150–600 mg/day) PGB: 13 (25%) experienced complete pain relief and 26 (49%) reported pain reduction > 50%, whereas 14 (26%) did not improve. Patients without concomitant facial pain showed better response rates (32 of 39, 82%) compared with patients with concomitant chronic facial pain (7 of 14, 50%, P = 0.020). Concomitant chronic facial pain appears to be a clinical predictor of poor treatment outcome. PGB appears to be effective in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

Conclusions

Recent advances in TN have led to an improvement in its classification on the basis of the neuroimaging findings. Better understanding and description of other neuralgiform disorders such as SUNCT and SUNA have made the differential diagnosis clearer. Improved care pathways involving multidisciplinary teams and potentially new medications is resulting in improved outcomes for patients with TN.

Key points

Trigeminal neuralgia is currently classified into three subgroups: idiopathic, classical and secondary, based on imaging findings; MR brain imaging with trigeminal sequences is therefore essential in the diagnostic work-up.
An accurate diagnosis is crucial because the clinical management differs among the various forms of facial pain.
Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine remain the medications of choice; lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used as second-line treatments in monotherapy or polytherapy.
In pharmaco-resistant cases, trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia, whereas neuroablative surgical treatments and microvascular decompression can be considered in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
Pharmaco-resistant cases as well as cases where diagnosis is unclear should be referred to multidisciplinary facial pain teams led by neurologists specialising in headache disorders, where dedicated teams may confirm the diagnosis and offer advanced treatments.

### Non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia [^115USqbx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used in trigeminal neuralgia management since the 1970s.

Objectives

The objective was to review systematically the efficacy of non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (all to August 2005) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System, the database of the Chinese Cochrane Center (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2005), conference paper databases and checked bibliographies. We handsearched ten Chinese journals.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria and graded methodological quality independently.

Main Results

Nine trials of different non-antiepileptic drugs involving 223 participants were included. Each trial investigated one non-antiepileptic drug. Two trials tested baclofen. In one, more people gained 50% reduction from baseline than with placebo (relative risk 15.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 231.84, P value = 0.05). In the other, slightly more participants on baclofen had a 75% reduction in attacks on the 10th day compared with carbamazepine (relative risk 2.38, 95% CI 0.83 to 6.85, P value = 0.11). One trial showed no significant difference in reduction in average daily frequency of attacks with L-Baclofen compared with racemic baclofen. Tizanidine was investigated in two trials. In one, the proportion of people with reduction in the average number of paroxysms per day increased with tizanidine compared with placebo (relative risk 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69, P value = 0.03). In the other, one of five participants improved in visual analog scale score with tizanidine and four of six with carbamazepine (relative risk 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.89, P value = 0.20). One study showed that the improvement in mean values of pain scores with tocainide was similar to that of carbamazepine. In one study more participants improved during the pimozide than the carbamazepine period (relative risk 1.78, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.28). In one study, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% instillation into the eyes was not significantly different from placebo (relative risk 1.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.99, P value = 0.92). In another, there was moderate or marked improvement in seven of nine participants treated with clomipramine and three of nine with amitriptyline after a 12-week treatment (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 6.27).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed.

Trigeminal neuralgia

TN is a chronic paroxysmal neuropathic pain condition that is described as a severe, lancinating, and electric-like unilateral pain. It is localized most often to the second and third distributions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3) intraorally and extraorally and can present in both distributions at the same time. There is usually a trigger zone in the trigeminal distribution which, when stimulated, can result in an excruciatingly painful attack. The pain attacks last seconds to minutes and numerous pain episodes can be present daily. TN commonly goes through periods of remission where the pain can remit for months or even longer.

The etiology of TN is often related to vascular compressionthat may result in focal demyelination. The superior cerebellar artery compression on the trigeminal root has been shown to be responsible for attacks of TN pain; however, nonvascular compression by a cerebellopontine angle neoplasm, such as acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, cholesteatomas, and neurofibromas, have also been shown to result in TN attacks. A cranial nerve exam can demonstrate other neural deficits that may be present due to a mass pressing on the trigeminal root. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain should be requested in order to rule out any intracranial pathology. Furthermore, myelin loss due to multiple sclerosis has been shown to be a causative disorder related to the paroxysmal pain firing of TN attacks.

Antiepileptic medications are the drugs of choice for the management of TN. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and gabapentin are commonly used as first-line medications. Carbamazepine, evaluated in a systematic review, has been shown to be the most effective treatment. If these medications are not effective, or if the therapeutic range cannot be achieved due to side effects, then doses should be lowered and second-line drugs, such as baclofenand lamotrigine, may be added to reduce the pain attacks. It is best to reduce the pain attacks completely with multiple medications if necessary. After achieving pain-free status and monitoring for pain attacks for a minimum of 3–6 months, a slow taper off of medication will demonstrate if the TN has gone into remission. If pain attacks recur, then pharmacologic management should immediately be reinstituted. If medications are no longer effective or if unmanageable side effects develop, then neurosurgical options, such as microvascular decompression or gamma knife radiosurgery, may be considered.

### Phenytoin and carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia: marketing-based versus evidence-based treatment [^114xiZLU]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most review articles support carbamazepine as a first-line pharmacotherapy for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.–However, the empirical support for this recommendation is somewhat suspect. Phenytoin, as the prototype for all anticonvulsants, was already positioned as an analgesic compound 70 years ago. Since these initial findings, the data that have been gathered have supported the use of anticonvulsants as painkillers – from phenytoin up to and including more recent anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Since 1942, a number of papers supported phenytoin's therapeutic effects in trigeminal neuralgia (Table 1). The introduction of carbamazepine in 1962 by Geigy shifted the interest of neurologists from phenytoin as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia to carbamazepine, without sound scientific evidence. To date, no convincing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published supporting the role of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia, and we could not identify a single study comparing the effects of phenytoin with those of carbamazepine. Accordingly, phenytoin should probably be considered more often as a viable therapy for (treatment-resistant) trigeminal neuralgia.

Trigeminal neuralgia: one of the first repositioning indications of phenytoin

The exploration of phenytoin as an analgesic in neuralgic pain started 5 years after Putnam and Merritt identified the compound in 1937 as a treatment for convulsions. In 1942, a French otolaryngologist reported that 200–300 mg phenytoin daily was effective in reducing pain in three patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia. In 1944, a case study of a patient suffering from paroxysmal abdominal pain but responding well to phenytoin was presented; the pain attacks in his case were (perhaps erroneously) interpreted as a form of focal symptomatic epilepsy. The first indication in the field of pain that was explored intensively as a new indication (repositioning) for phenytoin was trigeminal neuralgia, most likely due to its paroxysmal character – reminiscent of epileptic discharges.

### Design of phase 3 studies evaluating vixotrigine for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia [^111CH7P4]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of both studies is the proportion of participants classified as responders at Week 12 of the double-blind period, where a responder is a participant who has ≥ 30% reduction in weekly mean pain score at Week 12 of the double-blind period from baseline, has not discontinued randomized study treatment before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period, and has not taken prohibited pain medication before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period (Figure 2). The 3 secondary endpoints relate to the proportion of participants who meet the definition of responder based on 1) a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) response of "much improved" or "very much improved"; 2) ≥ 50% reduction in mean number of paroxysms from baseline; and 3) ≥ 50% reduction in mean pain score from baseline (Figure 2). For all responder-based endpoints, nonresponders will be classified as participants who did not meet all the criteria that define a responder. Other secondary endpoints will include the incidence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), quality of life, and evaluation of vixotrigine population pharmacokinetics (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum concentration at steady state [C max]). Additional endpoints include proportion of responders based on the following criteria (Figure 2): 1) ≥ 30% reduction in mean worst pain score from baseline and 2) ≥ 30% reduction in mean number of paroxysms from baseline; change from baseline in mean pain score, mean worst pain score, and mean number of paroxysms at double-blind Week 12; change from baseline in mean pain score, mean worst pain score, and mean number of paroxysms by week during the dose-optimization/open-label and double-blind periods; average amount (dose in mg) of 1) acetaminophen, 2) pregabalin, and 3) immediate-release oxycodone used for TN pain per week while receiving randomized treatment; change from baseline to double-blind Week 12 in the Penn Facial Pain Scale-Revised (PENN-FPS-R) score, EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level version (EQ-5D-5L) score, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Neuropathic Pain v2.0 score; and change from baseline in PENN-FPS-R score by week and change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L and WPAI: Neuropathic Pain v2.0 scores by visit, during the dose-optimization/open-label and double-blind periods.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): current therapies and topical treatment option with high-concentration capsaicin [^111eTvn4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticonvulsants

I. Gabapentin/pregabalin

Although both gabapentin and pregabalin have been shown to be effective in the treatment of polyneuropathies, only limited scientific evidence for CIPN treatment exists. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of gabapentin in patients with CIPN (n = 115) revealed no improvement in either pain intensity or sensory neuropathy. Pregabalin was shown to be superior to amitriptyline und gabapentin (as well as placebo) in a randomized cancer study with respect to neuropathic pain and side effects. Common adverse reactions to pregabalin and gabapentin include dizziness, drowsiness, and somnolence; pregabalin is also more frequently associated with weight gain.

Similar to tricyclic antidepressant, gabapentin and pregabalin may be considered for CIPN treatment based on the limited therapeutic options and the demonstrated efficacy of these agents in other neuropathic pain conditions.
II. Carbamazepine

Carbamazepine cannot be recommended for treatment of neuropathic pain in general due to low evidence and frequent side effects. However, administration can be considered in single cases and is generally recommended in trigeminal neuralgia.

Opioids

Overall, the response of neuropathic pain to opioid therapy is low. Administration of oxycodone during chemotherapy was associated with a lowered incidence of CIPN. According to the German Society for Neurology, low- as well as high-potency opioids might be considered for treating neuropathic pain of any origin as third-line option, although side effects, development of tolerance, and misuse might be limiting.

Non-opioid analgesics

Non-opioid analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), metamizole, or paracetamol display low efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain and are considered to be associated with a variety of potential side effects. However, peripheral nerve damage and neuropathic pain may arise from tissue pressure increase due to swelling of the feet and/or hands and has been described as a result of chronic venous insufficiency. In these cases, NSAID therapy may be effective in reducing swelling and corresponding pain.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115Vk6Ri]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — first-line pharmacotherapy and evidence gaps: The two drugs to consider as first-line therapy in TN are carbamazepine (CBZ) (200–1,200 mg/day) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) (600–1,800 mg/day). Although the evidence for CBZ is stronger than for OXC, the latter may pose fewer safety concerns. There is little evidence to guide the clinician after the treatment of patients with TN who fail first-line therapy, the effect of other drugs commonly used in neuropathic pain is unknown, and there are no published studies directly comparing polytherapy with monotherapy.

Figure 1: Patients Achieving Various Levels of Improvement in Pain Intensity – Study DPN 1

Study DPN 2: This 8-week study compared pregabalin 100 mg three times a day with placebo. Treatment with pregabalin 100 mg three times a day statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. For various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 2 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

14.2 Postherpetic Neuralgia

The efficacy of pregabalin for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. These studies enrolled patients with neuralgia persisting for at least 3 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Seventy-three percent of patients completed the studies. The baseline mean pain scores across the 3 studies ranged from 6 to 7. Patients were permitted up to 4 grams of acetaminophen per day as needed for pain, in addition to pregabalin. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: treatment of diabetic neuropathy [^117VSeG9]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

UA: So the two commonest anticonvulsants used and the ones with the greatest amount of evidence is gabapentin and pregabalin. So gabapentin has an effect. It's a GABAergic drug that actually binds to the alpha 2 delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and it's thought to cause an inhibition through this pathway. Pregabalin has a similar effect and also binds to the alpha 2 delta ligand. The other two medications which were previously used in the anticonvulsant class were carbamazepine and phenytoin; however, they've really fallen out of favour now and they're rarely used. Carbamazepine tends only to be used in trigeminal neuralgia. The other anticonvulsant which has found some favour, although the level of evidence is not so great, is sodium valproate and there was a recent Cochrane review [for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia] which suggests that sodium valproate did not have any specific advantages over placebo.

VG: Which medications in the class of tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy?

UA: So the tricyclic antidepressant that's most commonly used is amitriptyline and one of the reasons for this is the trade-off with side effects that you get with the tricyclic antidepressants and the actual efficacy itself. In terms of the tricyclic antidepressant that has the lowest number needed to treat for benefit, this is actually imipramine. [However, the quality of evidence for imipramine in neuropathic pain is considered poor.] However, imipramine does cause greater side effects than amitriptyline, so we tend to find that amitriptyline is more commonly used. Now amitriptyline generally requires a dose titration; patients are initiated on lower doses and subsequently a dose titration required to gain maximal efficacy. Overall, studies of tricyclics in diabetic neuropathy are small and are likely to have bias but the decades of use in painful diabetic neuropathy means that tricyclics have a robust standing within the international guidelines. Interestingly, tricyclics may have some modulatory effects on the opioid receptor but one thing we have to consider is their use is generally cautioned in people with cardiovascular disease and elderly people, and tricyclics need to be avoided in people with a prolonged QT or underlying cardiac arrhythmias.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^1124Yi6s]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3–4 weeks of the trial if each patient's dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient's needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice–than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.

### AAN-EFNS guidelines on trigeminal neuralgia management [^112b9EK7]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Several issues regarding diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are still unsettled. The American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies launched a joint Task Force to prepare general guidelines for the management of this condition. After systematic review of the literature the Task Force came to a series of evidence-based recommendations. In patients with TN MRI may be considered to identify patients with structural causes. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful to disclose symptomatic TN, whereas younger age of onset, involvement of the first division, unresponsiveness to treatment and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials are not useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN. Carbamazepine (stronger evidence) or oxcarbazepine (better tolerability) should be offered as first-line treatment for pain control. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy early surgical therapy may be considered. Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife and microvascular decompression may be considered. Microvascular decompression may be considered over other surgical techniques to provide the longest duration of pain freedom. The role of surgery versus pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis remains uncertain.

### A retrospective evaluation of the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with postherpetic neuralgia in usual-care settings [^116YddF9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Both gabapentin and pregabalin are approved for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), although dosing and pharmacokinetic differences between these medications may affect their use in actual practice.

Objectives

This study was conducted to characterize the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in the management of PHN in clinical practice, with a specific focus on the doses actually prescribed and changes in the use of other neuropathic pain-related medications after the initiation of gabapentin or pregabalin.

Methods

The PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database was used to identify patients with PHN who were newly prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin between September 1, 2005, and March 31, 2006. The out-comes of interest were the prevalence of comorbidities, exposure to neuropathic pain-related medications (ie, the proportions of patients receiving ≥ 1 prescription for these medications in the 6-month periods before and after the date of the first gabapentin or pregabalin prescription), and attainment of therapeutic dose levels (gabapentin, ≥ 1800 mg/d; pregabalin, ≥ 150 mg/d).

Results

The database search identified 151 patients with PHN who were newly prescribed gabapentin (57.0% female; mean [SD] age, 55.8 [11.3] years) and 100 patients who were newly prescribed pregabalin (62.0% female; mean age, 52.8 [9.4] years). The prevalence of comorbidities did not differ significantly between recipients of prescriptions for gabapentin or pregabalin, with the exception of hyperlipidemia, which was more prevalent in those prescribed gabapentin (33.8% vs 22.0%, respectively; P = 0.044), and depression, which was more prevalent in those prescribed pregabalin (12.0% vs 4.6%, respectively; P = 0.031). In the pretreatment period, those who were prescribed pregabalin had significantly greater use of long-acting opioids (P = 0.005), anticonvulsants (P < 0.001), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (P < 0.001), and the lidocaine 5% patch (P = 0.005) compared with those prescribed gabapentin. Use of any opioid increased from pretreatment to follow-up in those prescribed gabapentin, significantly so in those who received ≥ 2 opioid prescriptions (P = 0.016). Use of any opioid decreased significantly from pre-treatment to follow-up in those prescribed pregabalin (P = 0.005), particularly in those who received ≥ 2 opioid prescriptions (P = 0.004). Tramadol use decreased significantly in those prescribed gabapentin (P = 0.045), and anticonvulsant use decreased significantly in those prescribed pregabalin (P = 0.004). Among patients prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin who received 1 prescription, 2 consecutive prescriptions, and ≥ 3 consecutive prescriptions, a greater proportion of those prescribed pregabalin attained therapeutic dose levels by their first, second, and third consecutive prescriptions compared with those prescribed gabapentin (69.0% vs 3.5%, respectively [P < 0.001]; 71.4% vs 21.7% [P < 0.001]; and 89.3% vs 46.2% [P < 0.001], respectively).

Conclusions

In these patients with PHN in the usual-care setting, opioid use increased after the initiation of gabapentin and decreased after the initiation of pregabalin. Few of those prescribed gabapentin received a prescription for a therapeutic dose, whereas a greater proportion of patients who were prescribed pregabalin received a prescription for a therapeutic dose.

### Role of the neurologist in the evaluation and treatment of patients with trigeminal neuralgia [^117R8GBX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2005). Low credibility.

The neurologist, although not usually the first healthcare provider to evaluate a patient with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), is often involved in confirming the diagnosis and managing the patient's pain with medications. The neurologist has several other important roles for patients with TN: assessing and reducing the individual's pain, patient and family education, and encouraging referral to a neurosurgeon for pain-reducing procedures when appropriate. In general, surgical procedures for TN should be considered when the patient does not attain pain relief after adequate trials of two or three medications, or when pain relief is attained but the patient requires medication dosing at levels that result in significant drug toxicity. There is emerging evidence that surgical procedures for TN are more effective if performed earlier in the course of the patient's pain.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^114av2CV]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a highly disabling disorder characterised by very severe, brief and electric shock like recurrent episodes of facial pain. New diagnostic criteria, which subclassify TN on the basis of presence of trigeminal neurovascular conflict or an underlying neurological disorder, should be used as they allow better characterisation of patients and help in decision-making regarding medical and surgical treatments. MR imaging, including high-resolution trigeminal sequences, should be performed as part of the diagnostic work-up. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used either alone or as add-on therapy. Surgery should be considered if the pain is poorly controlled or the medical treatments are poorly tolerated. Trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with trigeminal neurovascular conflict while neuroablative surgical treatments can be offered if MR imaging does not show any neurovascular contact or where patients are considered too frail for microvascular decompression or do not wish to take the risk.

### Anticonvulsant drugs for acute and chronic pain [^114uTH9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anticonvulsant drugs have been used in the management of pain since the 1960s. The clinical impression is that they are useful for chronic neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning. Readers are referred to reviews of carbamazepine and gabapentin in the Cochrane Library which replace the information on those drugs in this review. Other drugs remain unchanged at present in this review

Objectives

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of anticonvulsant drugs for pain management in clinical practice. Migraine and headache studies are excluded in this revision.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of anticonvulsants in acute, chronic or cancer pain were identified by MEDLINE (1966–1999), EMBASE (1994–1999), SIGLE (1980–1999) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 1999). In addition, 41 medical journals were hand searched. Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. Date of most recent search: September 1999.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of anticonvulsant drugs in patients, with subjective pain assessment as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and trials were quality scored. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse effects and drug-related study withdrawal, for individual studies and for pooled data.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials of six anticonvulsants were considered eligible (1,074 patients). The only placebo-controlled study in acute pain found no analgesic effect of sodium valproate. Three placebo-controlled studies of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia had a combined NNT (95% confidence interval (CI)) for effectiveness of 2.5 (CI 2.0–3.4). A single placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin in post-herpetic neuralgia had an NNT of 3.2 (CI 2.4–5.0). For diabetic neuropathy NNTs for effectiveness were as follows: (one RCT for each drug) carbamazepine 2.3 (CI 1.6–3.8), gabapentin 3.8 (CI 2.4–8.7) and phenytoin 2.1 (CI 1.5–3.6). Numbers-needed-to-harm (NNHs) were calculated where possible by combining studies for each drug entity irrespective of the condition treated. The results were, for minor harm, carbamazepine 3.7 (CI 2.4–7.8), gabapentin 2.5 (CI 2.0–3.2), phenytoin 3.2 (CI 2.1–6.3). NNHs for major harm were not statistically significant for any drug compared with placebo. Phenytoin had no effect in irritable bowel syndrome, and carbamazepine little effect in post-stroke pain. Clonazepam was effective in one study of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Authors' Conclusions

Although anticonvulsants are used widely in chronic pain surprisingly few trials show analgesic effectiveness. Only one studied considered cancer pain. There is no evidence that anticonvulsants are effective for acute pain. In chronic pain syndromes other than trigeminal neuralgia, anticonvulsants should be withheld until other interventions have been tried. While gabapentin is increasingly being used for neuropathic pain the evidence would suggest that it is not superior to carbamazepine.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^114Dv8AD]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Comparisons Between Capsaicin 179 mg Patch and Pregabalin

To our knowledge, only one head-to-head comparative trial in patients with PNP has been completed to date and is therefore described here in more detail. ELEVATE, a Phase IV, 8-week, multicenter, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority study in 568 patients with PNP, was the first clinical trial to compare the capsaicin 179 mg patch with pregabalin. The capsaicin 179 mg patch offered non-inferior pain relief compared with an optimized dose of pregabalin, as measured by the proportion of patients in each arm who achieved ≥ 30% decrease in the 'average pain for the past 24 hours' Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score by week 8. The capsaicin 179 mg patch also demonstrated a faster onset of action (median time to onset was 7.5 days vs 36.0 days with pregabalin [p < 0.001]) and was associated with fewer systemic side effects and greater treatment satisfaction. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with the capsaicin 179 mg patch were mainly application site reactions versus CNS effects with pregabalin.

### Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults [^1174DjWC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis. Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia. With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo. Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^113Q6Pp5]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication use and sex differences

At baseline, medication use was similar across both cohorts (80%, p > 0.99) (Table 3). At 5 years, fewer MVD patients remained on medical treatment compared to the medical cohort (23% vs 62%, p < 0.001).

Table 3
Medication use at baseline and 5-year follow-up

Proportions and 95% confidence intervals are shown for each medication type, stratified by treatment group and time point. First-line medications include carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine; second-line include gabapentin, pregabalin, and lamotrigine. Comparison of medication-free status and first-line vs. second-line drug use between groups at each time point was assessed using Pearson's χ² test with Yates' continuity correction

MVD microvascular decompression, CI confidence interval

In the MVD cohort, baseline medication use did not differ by sex (p = 0.64), but by 5 years, a higher proportion of men had discontinued treatment (91% vs 65%, p = 0.003). Use of second-line drug remained more common in women (0% vs 50%, p = 0.01) (Supplementary Table 2 a).

In the medical cohort, baseline medication use was slightly higher among men (89% vs 76%, p = 0.10), and they more often used first-line drugs (73% vs 50%, p = 0.05). At follow-up, men were more likely to remain on medication (84% vs 54%, p = 0.003), but second-line drug use did not differ significantly between sexes (42% vs 53%, p = 0.43) (Supplementary Table 2 b).

Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine has been reported to be helpful as an add-on therapy in a small randomised cross-over trial. Lamotrigine can be used in patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, or as add-on therapy to increase efficacy. It is generally associated with fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The dose of lamotrigine should be escalated slowly as the incidence of lamotrigine-induced rash is well recognised to be dose and titration dependent. About 10% of people taking lamotrigine develop benign adverse cutaneous reactions. However life-threatening conditions, like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can rarely occur. Since the introduction of a slow-dose titration protocol, the rate of severe rashes has reduced to 0.1%–0.01%. In view of the need for this slow-dose titration, lamotrigine is not appropriate for managing severe TN exacerbation to those who need rapid pain control.

Gabapentin and pregabalin

There are 16 randomised controlled trials for gabapentin, all published in Chinese, comparing it with carbamazepine. However, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions as the inclusion criteria, endpoints and dosage are either not clarified or very varied. There are no such trials for pregabalin, but a long-term study suggests that it may be effective.

Clinical experience shows that gabapentin and pregabalin are less effective but have fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. They can therefore be used in place of or in addition to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. However, there is a risk of dependency and they are controlled drugs in the UK.

Baclofen

Baclofen can help in TN especially in people with multiple sclerosis who may be using the drug for spasticity.

### EFNS guidelines on pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^115Qk8L2]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools.

Materials and methods

Studies included in the post-hoc analysis

In total, 13 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials were considered for inclusion in the current study. Two trials were specifically conducted in Chinese patients (identifiers: NCT00301223 and NCT01455428), and both were included in the analysis. Of the remaining 11 trials under consideration for inclusion in the international patient group, seven were excluded for the following reasons: did not complete (one trial); tested a controlled release formulation of pregabalin (one trial); duration shorter than 8 weeks (three trials); patient populations ethnically similar to Chinese patients (Japan and Korea, one trial each). As a result of exclusions, four trials were included in the international patient group. These trials were conducted in patients from Australia, Europe, and North America.–The international trials were conducted before trial registration was required, so no ClinicalTrials. gov identifiers are available. All six of the trials included in this post-hoc analysis were originally approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee for each participating investigational center, and were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Each patient provided written informed consent to participate in the trial. No new patients were recruited for this post-hoc analysis.

Treatment Strategies for TN

First-line treatment therapies for TN involve medical management with anticonvulsant medications (Table 1). Patients who fail medical management due to persistent pain or unacceptable side effects have transcutaneous, percutaneous, radiotherapy, and open surgical options available to them (Figure 1). Patient selection criteria, as well as the pros and cons of each procedure option are summarized in Table 2. In general, percutaneous, radiosurgical, and open surgical therapies for TN are most effective in patients with type 1 TN. Patients with type 2 TN are more likely to have pain recurrence and a shorter pain-free interval compared with patients with type 1 TN. Patients with secondary TN (eg, tumors), should undergo treatment for the underlying pathology (eg, tumor resection and decompression) in order to achieve pain relief. In patients who are not surgical candidates, medical management of secondary TN may be offered for symptomatic control.

Practice parameter — diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, or microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of patients with TN remains uncertain.

### Treatment patterns of postherpetic neuralgia patients before and after the launch of pregabalin and its effect on medical costs: analysis of Japanese claims data provided by Japan medical data center [^115hzU9r]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Except for neurotrophin, no drug had an indication for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in Japan prior to pregabalin approval. This approval might have changed PHN treatment patterns. This study aimed to compare PHN treatment patterns and medical costs between patients who started treatment before and after pregabalin approval. Japanese claims data were used to identify patients aged 18 years or more with PHN, postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia or postherpetic polyneuropathy who were initiated on their first PHN-associated prescription through May 2010 (before approval) or from June 2010 (after approval). From these claims, 6-month treatment patterns from first prescription were compared for the periods before and after approval. These patterns included pain-related medications and the frequency of pain-relief procedures. All-cause and pain-related medical costs were also compared for these periods. The number of PHN patients who were initiated on treatment before and after approval were 107 (mean age, 47.4 ± 13.0 years) and 505 (45.9 ± 13.0), respectively. Post-approval, significant reductions were observed for prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants and neurotrophin relative to before approval. Excluding pregabalin acquisition costs, mean costs per patient for medications associated with PHN for 6 months from the first prescription were significantly lower after approval, ¥2882 vs ¥4185. Total medical costs were similar in both periods. Approval of pregabalin appeared to result in a treatment paradigm toward use of an approved therapy with demonstrated efficacy.

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^115VS6Q2]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a severe facial pain disorder characterized by recurrent, shock-like paroxysms affecting one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. It significantly impacts quality of life, with up to 45% of patients missing daily activities and more than 50% experiencing anxiety. Trigeminal neuralgia also poses a substantial economic burden through direct medical costs and productivity loss. The management traditionally involves several specialties, including neurology, neurosurgery, radiology, and dentistry. Yet very few high-quality prospective studies evaluate treatment efficacy and side effects, and none compare medical and surgical outcomes.

First-line treatment consists of the sodium channel blockers carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, while second-line options include gabapentin, pregabalin, and lamotrigine. In a prospective study of 103 medically treated patients, 51% achieved more than 50% pain reduction after 2 years. However, side effects are common, affecting 85%, with 44% discontinuing treatment due to intolerance. Women may experience higher pain recurrence and lower tolerability to first-line drugs, though the impact of sex on long-term outcomes remains unclear.

When medical treatment fails, international guidelines recommend procedures, such as microvascular decompression (MVD), balloon compression, or radiofrequency thermocoagulation. These options carry surgical risks, particularly MVD, which is the preferred option for classical trigeminal neuralgia where neurovascular contact (NVC) causes morphological changes of the trigeminal nerve, such as displacement, indentation, or atrophy. MVD may also benefit some patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and NVC without morphological changes.

Long-term prospective data on medical and surgical outcomes, including prognostic factors, are essential to guide treatment decisions. Building on previous research, this study aims to evaluate 5-year outcomes of medical treatment and MVD in trigeminal neuralgia patients managed within the same clinical setting. Objectives are to assess pain relief, medication use, and patient-reported outcomes, identify predictors of treatment success or failure, and, for the first time, directly compare long-term medical and surgical outcomes under standardized care.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic pain condition characterized by recurrent episodes of brief, usually unilateral, very severe pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve.TN is a relatively rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1.08 per 10,000 in the European Union and < 200,000 cases in the USA, and is more common in women. Population-based prevalence studies are limited in the USA, but a medical record–based study identified an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 4.7 per 100,000 person-years. Disease onset is typically after the age of 40 years and increases with age. A single episode or "paroxysm" usually lasts from less than a second and up to a few minutes, followed by a refractory period of several minutes. Symptomatic paroxysms typically occur in "bouts" lasting weeks to months, with periods of remission of up to 6 months. It has been assumed that the natural history of TN shows that paroxysms typically increase in severity, duration, and frequency, and periods of remission become shorter; however, this does not occur in all patients. When patients with TN are in a severe "bout", their quality of life is significantly affected, as they are unable to work or carry out usual activities of daily living. A hallmark of TN is that although patients may report spontaneous pain, paroxysms are almost always triggered by seemingly innocuous stimuli.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^112znau4]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Abortive treatments are not useful in the management of TN due to the brevity of the attacks. The mainstay of management is pharmacological preventive treatments. However, acute treatments that work rapidly have to be used occasionally for severe exacerbation. Surgical interventions are reserved for patients who fail to respond to or adequately tolerate medical therapies.

Pharmacological preventive treatments

The arsenal of preventive treatments for TN has now been in use for several decades but the quality of the evidence base is poor and there are few high-quality randomised controlled trials. Though these treatments are not supported by good quality randomised controlled trials, the clinical experience with some of these drugs (particularly carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen and botulinum toxin type A) is good, resulting in meaningful pain control although with still a substantial unmet need for more effective and better tolerated drugs. Table 4 summarises the available data on the commonly used drugs. Table 5 outlines the preventive treatments, recommended doses, and titration and tapering regimens we use. While monotherapy is preferred, up to one-third of patients require polytherapy, emphasising these patients' unmet therapeutic need. Patients should be encouraged to keep pain diaries to enable monitoring of response to treatments.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on trigeminal neuralgia [^113JHHEi]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an extremely painful condition which can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In Europe, TN patients are managed by many different specialities. Therefore, there is a great need for comprehensive European guidelines for the management of TN. The European Academy of Neurology asked an expert panel to develop recommendations for a series of questions that are essential for daily clinical management of patients with TN.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed and recommendations was developed based on GRADE, where feasible; if not, a good practice statement was given.

Results

The use of the most recent classification system is recommended, which diagnoses TN as primary TN, either classical or idiopathic depending on the degree of neurovascular contact, or as secondary TN caused by pathology other than neurovascular contact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a combination of three high-resolution sequences, should be performed as part of the work-up in TN patients, because no clinical characteristics can exclude secondary TN. If MRI is not possible, trigeminal reflexes can be used. Neurovascular contact plays an important role in primary TN, but demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of TN. Rather, it may help to decide if and when a patient should be referred for microvascular decompression. In acute exacerbations of pain, intravenous infusion of fosphenytoin or lidocaine can be used. For long-term treatment, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are recommended as drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, botulinum toxin type A, pregabalin, baclofen and phenytoin may be used either alone or as add-on therapy. It is recommended that patients should be offered surgery if pain is not sufficiently controlled medically or if medical treatment is poorly tolerated. Microvascular decompression is recommended as first-line surgery in patients with classical TN. No recommendation can be given for choice between any neuroablative treatments or between them and microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic TN. Neuroablative treatments should be the preferred choice if MRI does not demonstrate any neurovascular contact. Treatment for patients with secondary TN should in general follow the same principles as for primary TN. In addition to medical and surgical management, it is recommended that patients are offered psychological and nursing support.

Conclusions

Compared with previous TN guidelines, there are important changes regarding diagnosis and imaging. These allow better characterization of patients and help in decision making regarding the planning of medical and surgical management. Recommendations on pharmacological and surgical management have been updated. There is a great need for future research on all aspects of TN, including pathophysiology and management.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^1138rwFB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of ongoing treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen; carbamazepine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; oxcarbazepine; microvascular decompression; and destructive neurosurgical techniques (radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery).

### Pregabalin as mono-or add-on therapy for patients with refractory chronic neuropathic pain: a post-marketing prescription-event monitoring study [^113vxQVY]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This observational study examined the outcome of two different therapeutic strategies in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain by including pregabalin (PGB) as mono- or add-on therapy in one of two treatment options. Patients with a pain score of ≥ 4, refractory to usual care for neuropathic pain for at least 6 months, were allocated consecutively to one of two treatment strategies according to the decision of the physician: complete switch to a flexible-dosage, monotherapeutic or add-on therapy with pregabalin (PGB group), or change established doses and combinations of pre-existing mono- or combination therapy without pregabalin (non-PGB group). After 4 weeks (primary endpoint) a significant improvement in pain reduction was documented in both intention-to treat (ITT) analysis (PGB group, n = 85: mean pain score reduction of 3.53, SD 2.03, p < 0.001; non-PGB group, n = 102; mean pain score reduction of 2.83, SD 2.23, p < 0.001) and per-protocol (PP) analysis (PGB group, n = 79: mean pain score reduction 3.53 vs. 2.83, p < 0.05; non-PGB group, n = 81; 3.5 vs. 2.9, p < 0.05) compared to baseline. Comparison of the results observed in the two groups shows that patients in the PGB group achieved significantly greater pain reduction. These results demonstrate that PGB administered twice daily is superior to treatment regimes without PGB in reducing pain and pain-related interference in quality of life.

### Patient-reported outcomes in subjects with painful trigeminal neuralgia receiving pregabalin: evidence from medical practice in primary care settings [^115Fxp9i]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Effects of pregabalin (PGB) on patient-reported health outcomes were assessed in 65 PGB-naive subjects with trigeminal neuralgia refractory to previous analgesic therapy in a prospective, multicentre observational study carried out in primary care. Twelve weeks' monotherapy with PGB (n = 36) or add-on (n = 29), reduced baseline intensity of pain by a mean ± S.D. of -40.0 ± 22.1 mm [-55.4%, effect size (ES) 2.32; P < 0.0001] with 59.4% of responders (pain reduction ≥ 50%), and produced 34.6 ± 29.3 additional days with no/mild pain. Anxiety/depression symptoms decreased by -3.8 ± 3.5 and -4.5 ± 4.2 points (ES 0.95 and 1.02; P < 0.0001), respectively. PGB improved sleep by -17.9 ± 19.6 points (ES 1.18; P < 0.0001) and improved patient functioning (Sheehan Disability Index) by decreasing overall scoring by -8.6 ± 5.9 points (ES 1.59; P < 0.0001). Health state (EQ-5D) increased by 31.6 ± 22.2 mm (ES 1.67; P < 0.0001), with 0.0388 ± 0.0374 gained quality-adjusted life-years. In spite of the small sample size, results support the effectiveness of PGB for the improvement in pain and related health symptoms.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113Mht98]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of patients with PTNP did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect with pregabalin on mean pain intensity scores at the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of the study, week 15. However, the primary efficacy parameter (change in mean pain intensity scores) was statistically significant at most other time points, and several secondary outcomes related to analgesic efficacy and quality of life improved with pregabalin compared with placebo treatment. Pregabalin was superior to placebo in reducing pain severity and interference with daily function as measured by the BPI-sf. A significantly greater number of patients in the pregabalin group described their overall status as very much improved or much improved when comparing their assessment on the PGIC during the last week of treatment (i.e. week 15) to that at study outset. Finally, there was a consistent and significant reduction in pain interference with sleep over the course of the study.

### Advances in diagnosis, classification, pathophysiology, and management of trigeminal neuralgia [^113aNB2p]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful neurological condition with severe, stimulus-evoked, short-lasting stabbing pain attacks in the face. The past decade has offered new insights into trigeminal neuralgia symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment, leading to a change in the classification of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is crucial because neuroimaging interpretation and clinical management differ among the various forms of facial pain. MRI using specific sequences should be a part of the diagnostic workup to detect a possible neurovascular contact and exclude secondary causes. Demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm a diagnosis but rather to facilitate surgical decision making. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice for long-term treatment, whereas microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in medically refractory patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and animal models will provide further insight into the causes of trigeminal neuralgia and its pathophysiology. Development of more efficacious treatment options is highly warranted.

### Perioperative pregabalin administration does not prevent chronic postoperative pain: systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112SLfw7]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

The efficacy of perioperative pregabalin treatment for preventing chronic pain remains a matter of debate. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane, and Clinical Trial Register databases, and other sources, for randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of pregabalin and placebo. The primary outcome was the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) at 3 months. The secondary endpoints were CPSP at 3, 6, and 12 months and the incidence of chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain at the same time points. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed on the combined data. Evidence quality was rated by the GRADE method. We included 18 studies (2485 patients) in the meta-analysis. Overall, 60% of the trials reporting the primary outcome at 3 months were unpublished; the unpublished trials corresponded to 1492/1884 (79%) of the patients included in these studies. No difference in CPSP incidence between pregabalin and placebo was found at any time point; the risk ratio was 0.87 (0.66, 1.14), I = 57% at 3 months. The evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. Subgroup analysis by publication status, daily dose, type of administration, and type of surgery did not highlight any differences between subgroups. Insufficient data concerning the incidence of chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain were available for any firm recommendation to be made. Pooled data from published and unpublished studies provide no support for the efficacy of pregabalin for preventing CPSP.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^116UAULM]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

When there is no evidence of trigeminal neurovascular contact or there are significant comorbidities, ablative procedures are the preferred choice. The least invasive procedure is stereotactic radiosurgery. However, pain relief can be delayed by up to 6 months and sensory loss occurs frequently. Emerging evidence suggests that trigeminal internal neurolysis is highly effective in the long term but has a high complication rate (facial hypoaesthesia 96%, anaesthesia dolorosa 3.9%). The percutaneous neuroablative procedures (radiofrequency thermocoagulation, balloon compression, glycerol rhizolysis) provide on average 3–4 years of pain relief and repetitive ablative procedures are commonly required. Complication rates are high, especially with repetitive procedures. There is no evidence for preference of one procedure over another.

There is no clear guidance on the number of medical treatments that a patient has to fail before surgical approaches should be offered. It is important to make patients aware of the management options available, including both the medical and surgical approaches, early in the treatment pathway. We have outlined an algorithm of our practice (see figure 3). In patients with classical TN, we consider microvascular decompression when patients report a poor quality of life and there is either failure to respond or significant adverse effects with up to three groups of drugs. Carbamazepine and/or oxcarbazepine followed by lamotrigine and a gabapentinoid (gabapentin or pregabalin) can be tried. These can be used in combination. If these patients fail to respond to microvascular decompression, then we offer trials of other drugs not tried until then before considering neuroablative procedures. In both idiopathic and secondary TN (without evidence of neurovascular conflict), we tend to try more pharmacological treatments before considering neuroablative procedures, mainly because of the risk of long-term complications particularly with repetitive percutaneous neuroablative procedures. Patients who develop superimposed severe trigeminal neuropathy secondary to the neuroablative procedures can be very challenging to manage in the long term.

### Differential effects of pregabalin and morphine on the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms in mice with neuropathic pain [^112YURep]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's Perspective

Neuropathic pain, caused by nerve injury, is frequently associated with sleep disturbance, significantly impairing health-related quality of life. Neuropathic pain conditions, such as postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and diabetic neuropathy, can severely disrupt sleep quality. In turn, insufficient sleep increases pain intensity, creating a vicious cycle of chronic pain and sleep disorders.

Previous studies highlight the profound effects of neuropathic pain on sleep patterns in animal models. Rats with chronic constriction injury exhibit reduced sleep efficiency and increased arousals, while sciatic nerve-ligated mice show more wakefulness and reduced rapid eye movement (REM)and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Additionally, neuropathic pain is linked to circadian disruption, affecting the body's natural 24-h cycle of biological processes, including sleep–wake patterns, hormone release, and body temperature regulation. Patients with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia frequently report peak pain severity during the evening hours. Furthermore, both pain and sleep are under circadian regulation at the molecular level. These findings suggest a strong inter-relationship between neuropathic pain and circadian rhythms, raising the question of whether analgesics could also alleviate circadian disruptions.

Pregabalin, a structural analog of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that shares structural similarities with gabapentin, is a first-line drug for treating neuropathic pain. Pregabalin exerts its analgesic effects by binding to the α 2 δ 1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing pronociceptive substance release. – Pregabalin reduces sleep interference scores compared with placebo in adults with neuropathic pain, and enhances sleep quality in mice with partial sciatic nerve ligation. However, while evidence supports pregabalin's role in improving sleep quality, the mechanisms and extent to which it alleviates sleep and circadian disturbances associated with neuropathic pain remain unclear.

Morphine, an opioid analgesic commonly used for cancer pain, is recommended as a third-line drug for neuropathic pain treatment. Its analgesic mechanism involves binding to μ-opioid receptors, inhibiting the release of excitatory transmitters into synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and stimulating the production of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the descending pain pathway. – Notably, opioids have been shown to adversely affect sleep and circadian rhythms. Morphine reduces deep sleep and REM sleep in healthy human adults, and promotes wakefulness in healthy rodents, – while fentanyl induces phase shifts of circadian rhythmsand disrupts diurnal activity in rodents. However, it remains unclear whether morphine exacerbates or alleviates sleep and circadian abnormalities in neuropathic pain.

Efficacy of Pregabalin in pDPN: Evidence from RCTs

RCTs of pregabalin in pDPN, including NCT number, primary outcome measures and study population details, are summarised in Table 3.

Table 3
Randomised controlled trials of pregabalin in patients with pDPN

NCT ID clinicaltrials.gov registry number, LOCF last observation carried forward, MPS mean pain score; DPRS = daily pain rating scale, PRSI pain-related sleep interference, PGIC patient global impression of change, NNT number needed to treat

The efficacy of pregabalin in pDPN is proven through numerous RCTs (Table 3) and systematic reviews. Pregabalin is the first drug to receive an approved labelling from the Food and Drug Association (FDA) for the treatment of pDPN and post-herpetic neuralgia. It is the recommended first-line treatment in all five major international clinical guidelines for pDPN. In an early RCT of pregabalin in pDPN in 2004, Rosenstock et al. showed significant improvement in the mean pain scores, sleep interference, mood disturbance and tension anxiety over 8 weeks on pregabalin 300 mg/day (n = 146). Pregabalin was well tolerated despite the mild-to-moderate adverse events of increased dizziness and somnolence. A shorter 5-week double blind multi-centre RCT (n = 338) randomised patients to receive 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day or 600 mg/day of pregabalin or placebo. Participants in the 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day subgroups showed an improvement in mean pain score, sleep interference score, patient global impression of change, short-form (SF) McGill Questionnaire and multiple domains for the SF-36 Health Survey. There was a > 50% reduction in pain compared with baseline in 45% on 300 mg/day and 48% on 600 mg/day of pregabalin compared with 18% on placebo. In both studies, improvement in pain and sleep began at 1 week and continued throughout the titration and maintenance phase.

### Interventions for neuropathic pain: an overview of systematic reviews [^113EmLEC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Numerous interventions for neuropathic pain (NeuP) are available, but its treatment remains unsatisfactory. We systematically summarized evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials on interventions for NeuP. Five electronic databases were searched up to March 2015. Study quality was analyzed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. The most common interventions in 97 included SRs were pharmacologic (59%) and surgical (15%). The majority of analyzed SRs were of medium quality. More than 50% of conclusions from abstracts on efficacy and approximately 80% on safety were inconclusive. Effective interventions were described for painful diabetic neuropathy (pregabalin, gabapentin, certain tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), postherpetic neuralgia (gabapentin, pregabalin, certain TCAs, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, opioids, sodium valproate, topical capsaicin, and lidocaine), lumbar radicular pain (epidural corticosteroids, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS], and discectomy), cervical radicular pain (rTMS), carpal tunnel syndrome (carpal tunnel release), cubital tunnel syndrome (simple decompression and ulnar nerve transposition), trigeminal neuralgia (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and pimozide for refractory cases, rTMS), HIV-related neuropathy (topical capsaicin), and central NeuP (certain TCAs, pregabalin, cannabinoids, and rTMS). Evidence about interventions for NeuP is frequently inconclusive or completely lacking. New randomized controlled trials about interventions for NeuP are necessary; they should address safety and use clear diagnostic criteria.

Prognosis

TN is characterised by recurrences and remissions. Many people have periods of remission with no pain lasting months or years but in many, TN becomes more severe and less responsive to treatment over time, despite increasing pharmacological intervention. Most patients with TN are initially managed medically, and at our tertiary referral centre approximately 50% eventually have a surgical procedure.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^112djRzq]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Key points

Question Is pregabalin efficacious and tolerable for the treatment of chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain?

Findings In a double-blind, randomized international study of 542 evaluable patients (pregabalin n = 274) of whom approximately half had post-surgical neuropathic pain, the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo in change from baseline to week 15 (p = 0.1823). However, comparisons for key secondary outcome measures yielded p values < 0.05 favoring pregabalin. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile of pregabalin.

Meaning Additional studies are needed to characterize the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin for chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

CTN pharmacotherapy — carbamazepine (CBZ) demonstrates robust efficacy with defined tolerability, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) yields comparable pain reduction. Four placebo-controlled studies totaling 147 patients showed CBZ efficacy, with CBZ doses 300 to 2,400 mg a day and responses of 58 to 100% versus 0 to 40% on placebo; the number needed to treat to attain important pain relief was less than 2, while numbers needed to harm were 3 for minor and 24 for severe adverse events. Two Class II masked RCTs including 130 patients compared OXC 600–1,800 mg a day to CBZ, and reduction in pain was equally good for CBZ and OXC with 88% achieving a reduction of ≥ 50%. Conclusions state that "carbamazepine is established as effective" for controlling CTN pain, "oxcarbazepine is probably effective", "baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective", "topical ophthalmic anesthesia is probably ineffective", and "there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of clonazepam, gabapentin, phenytoin, tizanidine, topical capsaicin, and valproate" for CTN.

Figure 3
Proposed algorithm for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. *Microvascular decompression (MVD) appears effective even in idiopathic TN and may be more effective than stereotactic radiosurgery. **If any of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin or pregabalin have not been tried then trials of these agents should be considered. **Internal neurolysis is best avoided after MVD as there is a suggestion that there is a higher risk of anaesthesia dolorosa. Consider MVD if the secondary cause is optimally treated and there is evidence of neurovascular conflict; exercise caution in MS with ipsilateral pontine plaque. MS, multiple sclerosis; TN, trigeminal neuralgia.

Other considerations

Patients with TN, especially those whose symptoms are proving refractory to pharmacotherapy, are best managed in multidisciplinary team setting with a neurologist specialising in headache disorders, pain specialist, neurosurgeon, nurses and psychologists. In particular, we suggest that neurosurgical procedures for TN should only be done by experts with a high volume of cases to maintain the neurosurgical experience. Patients may benefit from a pain management programme to help them live well with pain and uncertainty.

Due to the rarity of the condition, patients feel isolated and patient groups such as Trigeminal Neuralgia Association TNA UK provide further invaluable support. Patients need to be provided with evidence-based written information such as provided by the Brain and Spine Foundation and advice from skilled teams.

Atypical odontalgia

AO is a centralized trigeminal neuropathy often localized in a tooth or tooth area that is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary dental treatments in attempts to relieve the pain. AO is described as a persistent idiopathic pain that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for cranial neuralgias and which is not attributed to another disorder, and can be throbbing and burning in nature. The pharmacological management of AO may include topical and systemic medications. If the pain is localized to a peripheral origin and the diagnostic block gives an equivocal response but a decrease in pain, a topical medication can be used and a neurosensory stent can be fabricated. Systemic approaches, such as tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers (pregabalin and gabapentin), sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine), and antiepileptics such as topiramate, can be used for the management of this condition. The management of AO is very challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary, which should include orofacial pain specialists and neurologists in addition to psychiatric and psychological evaluations in order to identify comorbidities with depression and anxiety.

### WITHDRAWN. anticonvulsant drugs for acute and chronic pain [^111xLzSg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anticonvulsant drugs have been used in the management of pain since the 1960s. The clinical impression is that they are useful for chronic neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning. Readers are referred to reviews of carbamazepine and gabapentin in T he Cochrane Library which replace the information on those drugs in this review. Other drugs remain unchanged at present in this review

Objectives

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of anticonvulsant drugs for pain management in clinical practice. Migraine and headache studies are excluded in this revision.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of anticonvulsants in acute, chronic or cancer pain were identified by MEDLINE (1966–1999), EMBASE (1994–1999), SIGLE (1980 to 1999) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 1999). In addition, 41 medical journals were hand searched. Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. Date of most recent search: September 1999.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of anticonvulsant drugs in patients, with subjective pain assessment as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent review authors, and trials were quality scored. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse effects and drug-related study withdrawal, for individual studies and for pooled data.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials of six anticonvulsants were considered eligible (1074 patients). The only placebo-controlled study in acute pain found no analgesic effect of sodium valproate. Three placebo-controlled studies of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia had a combined NNT (95% confidence interval (CI)) for effectiveness of 2.5 (CI 2.0 to 3.4). A single placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin in post-herpetic neuralgia had an NNT of 3.2 (CI 2.4 to 5.0). For diabetic neuropathy NNTs for effectiveness were as follows: (one RCT for each drug) carbamazepine 2.3 (CI 1.6 to 3.8), gabapentin 3.8 (CI 2.4 to 8.7) and phenytoin 2.1 (CI 1.5 to 3.6). Numbers-needed-to-harm (NNHs) were calculated where possible by combining studies for each drug entity irrespective of the condition treated. The results were, for minor harm, carbamazepine 3.7 (CI 2.4 to 7.8), gabapentin 2.5 (CI 2.0 to 3.2), phenytoin 3.2 (CI 2.1 to 6.3). NNHs for major harm were not statistically significant for any drug compared with placebo. Phenytoin had no effect in irritable bowel syndrome, and carbamazepine little effect in post-stroke pain. Clonazepam was effective in one study of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Authors' Conclusions

Although anticonvulsants are used widely in chronic pain surprisingly few trials show analgesic effectiveness. Only one study identified considered cancer pain. There is no evidence that anticonvulsants are effective for acute pain. In chronic pain syndromes other than trigeminal neuralgia, anticonvulsants should be withheld until other interventions have been tried. While gabapentin is increasingly being used for neuropathic pain the evidence would suggest that it is not superior to carbamazepine.

### Botulinum toxin – A for the treatment of neuralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CLbyv]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical examples of neuropathic pain include trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and postsurgical neuralgia. Of note, neuropathic pain is often difficult to treat and can lead to anxiety and depression, which seriously compromise patients' quality of life.

Over the years, the pharmacotherapies used for neuropathic pain include pregabalin, gabapentin, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, opioids, and so on. However, the evidence for these interventions is often inconclusive. In addition, side effects associated with the medications such as dizziness, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and rash can be troublesome and debilitating.

Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A), a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions and causes muscle relaxation. Animal studies have indicated several possible mechanisms for the analgesic effects of BTX-A: 1) it inhibits the release of pain mediators from both motor and sensory neurons, and blocks the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and other neuropeptide;2) it reduces chronic inflammation and acute injury by inhibiting neurotransmitter release; and 3) it deactivates the sodium channel in central nerve system neurons.

Recent studies have shown promising analgesic effects of BTX-A on postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and other types of neuralgia.–However, sample sizes of the previous studies are relatively small. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BTX-A in the treatment of neuralgia based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Assessments

Clinical efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments are the same for both studies. Clinical efficacy assessments include pain score, worst pain score, and number of paroxysms over the last 24 hrs (recorded daily in the evening through the LTE [if participating]) using an 11-point numerical rating scale in which participants rate pain from no pain (0) to worst pain imaginable (10); PGIC (relative to Day 1) and PENN-FPS-Rscore (recorded weekly through the LTE [if participating]); EQ-5D-5L and WPAI: Neuropathic Pain v2.0 scores (recorded at Day 1 and Week 4 of the dose-optimization/open-label periods and [for nonresponders receiving 150 mg TID in Study 1 only] Week 6 visits of the dose-optimization period; Week 4, 8, 12, and 14 visits of the double-blind period; upon premature treatment discontinuation; and at Day 1 through Week 52 of the LTE [if participating]); and amount of acetaminophen, pregabalin, immediate-release oxycodone, and immediate-release oxycodone/acetaminophen combination used for TN pain (recorded daily).

Clinical safety assessments will be conducted at screening and every subsequent visit in the full protocol and include physical examinations; 12-lead electrocardiograms; vital signs including temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate while sitting; Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS); and concomitant therapy and procedure review and recording of AEs and SAEs (monitoring and recording from the point of signing informed consent through end of LTE [if participating]).

Laboratory safety assessments will be conducted at screening and at subsequent visits, and will include pregnancy tests, standard hematology and chemistry parameters, and urinalyses.
