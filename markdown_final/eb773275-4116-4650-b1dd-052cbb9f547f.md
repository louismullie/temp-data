## Question

U waves

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about U waves on ECG, specifically their definition, physiology, normal variants, pathological patterns, measurement pitfalls, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and electrophysiologic basis. Then, I should verify normal variants and rate dependence. Next, I will examine pathological U waves by etiology, including ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, drugs, and genetic syndromes. After that, I need to check measurement and reporting pitfalls, especially QT/QU confusion. Finally, I will integrate prognostic data and outline practical management and follow-up steps, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or peer-reviewed evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and basic physiology. The U wave is a low-amplitude, low-frequency deflection that follows the T wave, most often seen in the right precordial leads V2–V3, and is generally thought to reflect a mechanoelectric phenomenon occurring after ventricular repolarization rather than a simple extension of repolarization itself, although mechanistic debates persist [^116xnEUd] [^1176NBJp]. Wait, let me verify the mechanistic nuance: while some modeling work suggests U waves can arise from small repolarization gradients even without M-cell dominance, contemporary consensus still frames the U wave as a late, mechanoelectric event linked to terminal repolarization dynamics and mechanical coupling, which aligns with clinical observations of U waves coinciding with aortic valve closure and isovolumic relaxation in short QT syndrome cohorts [^111RCaJZ] [^113fGSC4].

> I need to check normal variants and rate dependence. U waves are heart-rate dependent, typically absent at rates above about 95 bpm and present in roughly 90% of tracings when the heart rate is below 65 bpm, which explains why they are often overlooked in tachycardic recordings [^115cMy8Z]. Hold on, I should verify amplitude expectations: normal U waves are small, often cited around 0.33 mV or about 11% of T-wave amplitude, and are best appreciated in V2–V3; they are frequently absent in limb leads, which can lead to under-recognition if one relies on limb-lead tracings alone [^115cMy8Z] [^116xnEUd].

> Next, I should review when U waves become pathological. I need to ensure I distinguish increased amplitude, inverted morphology, and TU fusion. An inverted U wave in V2–V3 is abnormal and warrants explicit mention in the ECG report; large U waves that exceed T-wave amplitude are also abnormal and may indicate electrolyte derangement or drug effects; and U waves fused with the T wave can complicate interval measurement and mask repolarization abnormalities [^115cMy8Z].

> I will now examine ischemia-related U waves. Exercise-induced U-wave inversion in the anterior precordial leads is a recognized marker of inducible ischemia and can be the first and only ischemic sign on ECG in some patients, often reflecting proximal LAD disease physiology rather than classic ST depression alone [^1178UkLf] [^115eGk9E]. Let me consider broader prognostic data: negative U waves in population cohorts are uncommon (about 3.5%) yet carry adverse prognostic associations in men, including higher all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and cardiac hospitalizations independent of traditional risk factors, reinforcing the need to report and investigate them when present [^111bkSsW].

> But wait, what if the U-wave changes reflect hemodynamics rather than fixed ischemia. I should double-check for reversible factors: initial U-wave inversion has been described in hypertensive patients with impaired early relaxation and may resolve with acute or chronic blood pressure lowering, supporting a mechanoelectric link to diastolic mechanics rather than fixed infarction in some cases [^114KUh7g].

> Now, electrolyte disturbances. Hypokalemia classically produces prominent U waves, often with T-wave flattening and ST depression. When the U wave exceeds the T wave, potassium is typically less than 2.7 mmol/L, which is a critical threshold for arrhythmia risk and should trigger urgent potassium repletion and cause correction [^115cMy8Z] [^111QJpsS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought hyperkalemia would obliterate U waves entirely, but there are case reports of discordant U waves in chronic kidney disease with hyperkalemia, suggesting adaptation phenomena; still, the canonical teaching remains that hyperkalemia tends to blunt or suppress U waves, so I should flag any coexistence as atypical and contextual [^1148A9Ly].

> Let me review drug effects. Quinidine-class agents, amiodarone, and other QT-prolonging drugs can augment U waves and cause TU fusion, complicating interval measurement and signaling heightened torsade risk when combined with bradycardia or electrolyte shifts [^115cMy8Z] [^113EMYDX]. I should confirm the newer mechanistic data: methadone not only inhibits IKr but also potently blocks IK1, which slows terminal repolarization and augments U-wave integrals on surface ECG, providing a plausible explanation for its disproportionate torsade risk beyond IKr blockade alone [^111RgzBY] [^1123qYaP] [^114VhQjk]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the absence of dose–U-wave magnitude correlation in some patient series means U-wave prominence is a qualitative marker of repolarization instability rather than a dose-dependent surrogate, so I should treat any methadone-associated U-wave augmentation as a red flag even without a clear dose relationship [^111P28mF].

> I need to check genetic syndromes with characteristic U-wave phenotypes. Andersen–Tawil syndrome due to KCNJ2 mutations produces a distinctive T–U pattern with prolonged terminal T downslope, wide T–U junction, and biphasic/enlarged U waves; notably, QTc may be normal or only mildly prolonged, so recognizing the pattern can prevent mislabeling as long QT syndrome and guide genotype-directed care [^113aA568]. Let me verify: this syndrome often shows bidirectional VT and adrenergic triggers, and the U-wave signature is sufficiently specific to aid diagnosis and direct genetic testing, which is clinically actionable [^113aA568] [^116QovXb].

> Next, I should review measurement pitfalls. U waves that fuse with T waves can lead to overestimation of QT if the end of repolarization is taken at the nadir between T and U rather than at true T-wave offset; when T and U are indistinct, measuring QT in leads without U waves or using a tangent method helps, though both approaches risk underestimating true repolarization duration, so manual validation and lead selection are essential [^116rE22j]. Hold on, I should verify a common trap: including the U wave in QT measurement is a frequent cause of LQTS overdiagnosis; proper exclusion of U waves and attention to T-wave termination are necessary to avoid false-positive prolonged QT calls [^113dBztT] [^116rE22j].

> I should confirm prognostic implications of abnormal U waves. Beyond ischemia, large or inverted U waves can herald torsade in acquired or congenital long QT syndromes, particularly when they distort after pauses; giant T–U waves often precede torsade initiation and correlate with early afterdepolarization–triggered activity, underscoring their arrhythmic significance even outside overt ischemia [^116jWiP8] [^111L7C2T]. Let me reconsider the methadone signal: augmentation of U-wave integrals and lengthening of Tpeak–Tend after methadone initiation reflect loss of repolarization reserve and should prompt closer QT surveillance, electrolyte optimization, and consideration of alternatives when feasible [^111RgzBY] [^1123qYaP].

> Now, management implications. I need to ensure that any abnormal U wave triggers a systematic evaluation: check electrolytes, review QT-prolonging drugs, assess for structural disease or ischemia, and, when appropriate, perform exercise or pharmacologic stress testing if ischemia is suspected. If drug-induced, discontinue the offending agent and correct potassium/magnesium to the high-normal range, and use intravenous magnesium and overdrive pacing strategies if torsade risk emerges with QT–U distortion after pauses [^112qnTUo] [^1139UEzN]. Hold on, I should verify the specifics: potassium 4.5–5.0 mEq/L and magnesium repletion are reasonable targets in at-risk patients, and a short-long-short sequence with post-pause T–U distortion warrants immediate intervention rather than observation [^112qnTUo] [^1139UEzN].

> Let me think about reporting and documentation. I should explicitly report the presence of U waves when they are inverted, when they merge with the T wave, or when their amplitude exceeds the T wave, and I should note the leads involved. This aligns with AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendations and helps downstream clinicians recognize repolarization instability patterns that carry prognostic weight [^115cMy8Z]. I should double-check that the report distinguishes primary repolarization abnormalities from secondary changes due to altered depolarization, because that distinction influences interpretation and follow-up planning [^111YSeV3].

> Finally, I need to ensure I do not conflate entities. Wellens' pattern with deep anterior T-wave inversion is distinct from isolated negative U waves, though both may reflect anterior ischemia. Careful timing relative to the T wave and lead selection help differentiate terminal T inversion from true U inversion and avoid misclassification on serial ECGs [^113Wx7v5] [^115eGk9E]. If I initially misread a terminal T inversion as a negative U wave, I should correct that interpretation on review, documenting the T-wave offset and U-wave onset clearly to maintain diagnostic precision [^116rE22j].

U waves are small, positive deflections after the T wave, best seen in V2–V3 at slow heart rates, and reflect late repolarization of Purkinje fibers or mechanoelectric coupling during ventricular relaxation [^1176NBJp] [^116xnEUd]. Prominent U waves (> 1–2 mm or > T wave) suggest hypokalemia, bradycardia, or QT-prolonging drugs; **inverted U waves indicate ischemia or LV hypertrophy** and warrant evaluation for coronary disease or structural heart disease [^115cMy8Z] [^113kqeHR] [^1178UkLf]. U waves can precede torsades de pointes in long QT syndromes, so **large or distorted U waves** should prompt electrolyte correction, drug review, and ECG monitoring [^111L7C2T] [^1139UEzN] [^116jWiP8].

---

## Physiological basis and genesis

- **Late repolarization hypothesis**: U waves reflect delayed repolarization of Purkinje fibers or mid-myocardial M cells, creating a transmural gradient that generates the deflection [^1148A9Ly].

- **Mechanoelectric coupling hypothesis**: U waves coincide with early diastolic ventricular relaxation and aortic valve closure, supporting a mechanoelectric origin linked to mechanical stretch and afterload changes [^113fGSC4].

- **Heart rate dependence**: U waves are more prominent at slower rates (< 65 bpm) and often absent at faster rates (> 95 bpm), consistent with mechanoelectric coupling during diastole [^115cMy8Z].

---

## Normal U wave characteristics

- **Morphology**: Small, rounded, positive deflection after the T wave.

- **Amplitude**: Typically 0.5–2 mm; normally < 1/3 of T-wave amplitude.

- **Lead distribution**: Most visible in V2–V3; often absent in limb leads.

- **Heart rate**: More prominent at slower rates; less visible with tachycardia [^115cMy8Z].

---

## Clinical significance of prominent U waves

Prominent U waves (> 1–2 mm or exceeding T-wave amplitude) are **clinically significant** and often reflect underlying pathophysiology:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypokalemia | Delayed repolarization and increased transmural dispersion | - Arrhythmias <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - Torsades de pointes [^notfound] |
| Bradycardia | Enhanced mechanoelectric coupling during prolonged diastole | - Benign in healthy hearts <br/> - May indicate conduction disease |
| QT-prolonging drugs | Prolonged repolarization and increased dispersion | - Torsades de pointes <br/> - Sudden cardiac death [^113EMYDX] [^111L7C2T] |
| Left ventricular hypertrophy | Increased ventricular mass and repolarization heterogeneity | - Structural heart disease <br/> - Hypertension [^114ixpHD] |

---

## Clinical significance of inverted U waves

Inverted U waves are **abnormal** and strongly suggest underlying pathology:

- **Ischemic heart disease**: Inverted U waves are associated with myocardial ischemia, particularly of the anterior wall, and may precede ST-segment changes [^113kqeHR] [^115eGk9E].

- **Left ventricular hypertrophy**: Pressure overload (e.g. hypertension, aortic stenosis) can cause inverted U waves due to repolarization abnormalities [^114KUh7g].

- **Valvular heart disease**: Aortic regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse have been linked to inverted U waves.

- **Prognostic significance**: Inverted U waves independently predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization, particularly in men [^111bkSsW].

## U waves in specific cardiac conditions

### Long QT syndrome (LTS)

In long QT syndrome, **prominent U waves** are common and reflect prolonged repolarization and increased dispersion; they often precede torsades de pointes, especially after pauses or with QT–U distortion [^111L7C2T] [^116jWiP8]. Genetic LQTS (e.g. KCNQ1, KCNH2) shows characteristic U-wave patterns, and drug-induced LQTS features exaggerated U waves with QT prolongation [^115cMy8Z] [^113EMYDX].

---

### Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)

In Andersen-Tawil syndrome, **characteristic T–U patterns** include prolonged terminal T downslope, wide T–U junction, and biphasic/enlarged U waves; these patterns are highly specific for KCNJ2 mutations and help distinguish ATS from LQTS [^113aA568].

---

### Short QT syndrome (SQTS)

In short QT syndrome, the **U wave coincides with aortic valve closure**, supporting a mechanoelectric origin and suggesting a role for mechanical stretch in arrhythmogenesis [^113fGSC4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of abnormal U waves

When abnormal U waves are identified, **evaluate for underlying causes**:

- **Electrolytes**: Check serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium; correct hypokalemia promptly [^112qnTUo].

- **Drugs**: Review for QT-prolonging agents (e.g. antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, antipsychotics) [^112qnTUo].

- **Structural heart disease**: Assess for LV hypertrophy, valvular disease, and ischemia with echocardiography and stress testing [^113kqeHR].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider in suspected LQTS or ATS [^111xGNEZ].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Electrolyte correction**: Restore potassium and magnesium to normal/high-normal ranges [^112qnTUo].

- **Drug withdrawal**: Stop QT-prolonging agents; use alternatives when possible [^1139UEzN].

- **Monitoring**: Use continuous ECG in high-risk patients (e.g. drug-induced LQTS, torsades) [^1139UEzN].

- **Pacing**: Overdrive pacing or isoproterenol for bradycardia-mediated torsades [^112qnTUo].

- **ICD therapy**: Consider in high-risk LQTS or recurrent torsades despite medical therapy [^112qnTUo].

---

U waves are a marker of late repolarization and mechanoelectric coupling; **prominent or inverted U waves** indicate underlying disease and warrant targeted evaluation and management.

### U-waves and T-wave peak to T-wave end intervals in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, effects of β-blockers [^114zFETV]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is characterized by risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (pVT) and sudden death during stress. Experimental CPVT models show that delayed afterdepolarization (DAD)-induced triggered activity is the initiating mechanism of pVT, whereas an increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) controls degeneration of pVT to ventricular fibrillation. U-wave and T-wave peak to T-wave end interval (TPE) are regarded as electrocardiographic counterparts of DAD and TDR, respectively.

Objective

We tested hypotheses that patients with CPVT might show abnormal U-waves and TPE intervals and that beta-blockers could suppress appearance of these repolarization abnormalities.

Methods

We reviewed Holter recordings from 19 CPVT patients with a RyR2 mutation (P2328S or V4653F) and from 19 healthy unaffected subjects to record U-waves and TPE intervals as well as to measure beta-blockers' effects on ventricular repolarization by use of an automated computerized program.

Results

The maximal U-wave to T-wave amplitude ratio was 0.8 ± 0.6 in CPVT patients and 0.4 ± 0.3 in unaffected subjects (P = 0.009). Patients with most ventricular extrasystoles had a higher U-wave to T-wave amplitude ratio than those with fewest extrasystoles. Treatment with beta-blockers decreased U-wave amplitude at high heart rates. CPVT patients had longer TPE intervals than unaffected subjects at high heart rates, and beta-blocker treatment shortened their TPE intervals.

Conclusion

Present data support the hypothesis that U-waves associate with the DAD-triggered extrasystolic activity in CPVT patients. Patients with a RyR2 mutation show increased TPE at high heart rates. Beta-blocker treatment suppresses observed repolarization abnormalities in CPVT patients.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Procainamide hci [^113HML3Z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Complete Heart Block: Procainamide should not be administered to patients with complete heart block because of its effects in suppressing nodal or ventricular pacemakers and the hazard of asystole. It may be difficult to recognize complete heart block in patients with ventricular tachycardia, but if significant slowing of ventricular rate occurs during PA treatment without evidence of A-V conduction appearing, PA should be stopped. In cases of second degree A-V block or various types of hemiblock, PA should be avoided or discontinued because of the possibility of increased severity of block, unless the ventricular rate is controlled by an electrical pacemaker.

Idiosyncratic Hypersensitivity: In patients sensitive to procaine or other ester-type local anesthetics, cross sensitivity to PA is unlikely. However, it should be borne in mind, and PA should not be used if it produces acute allergic dermatitis, asthma, or anaphylactic symptoms.

Lupus Erythematosus: An established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is a contraindication to PA therapy, since aggravation of symptoms is highly likely.

Torsades de Pointes: In the unusual ventricular arrhythmia called "les torsades de pointes" (twistings of the points), characterized by alternation of one or more ventricular premature beats in the directions of the QRS complexes on ECG in persons with prolonged Q-T and often enhanced U waves, Group 1A antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Administration of PA in such cases may aggravate this special type of ventricular extrasystole or tachycardia instead of suppressing it.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part IV: the ST segment, T and U waves, and the QT interval: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^111ZfAGp]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary repolarization abnormalities — recognition and vector relationships — are characterized by directions opposite to depolarization vectors: In left bundle-branch block, the ST-segment and T-wave vectors are generally directed opposite to the mean QRS vector; in right bundle-branch block they are directed opposite to the slow terminal component of the QRS complex; and in ventricular preexcitation, ST-T changes are directed opposite to the delta wave of the QRS complex. When the direction of the QRS axis is normal, an abnormal direction of the T-wave axis is generally an indication of primary repolarization abnormalities. The practical utility of the ventricular gradient in differentiating primary from secondary repolarization abnormalities has not been demonstrated. With transiently altered ventricular conduction from ectopic ventricular complexes or transient bundle-branch blocks, secondary ST- and T-wave changes usually revert promptly to the prior pattern, whereas some secondary repolarization changes take longer (hours or days) to develop and to dissipate, such as those associated with prolonged ventricular pacing.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Type 1 myocardial infarction — spontaneous is described as a spontaneous clinical syndrome related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus and ensuing myocyte necrosis, and requires a detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cTn) with at least 1 value > 99th percentile of the URL and at least 1 of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia; new or presumed new significant ST-segment T wave changes or new LBBB on the ECG; development of pathological Q waves on the ECG; imaging evidence of new loss of myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality; or identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy. Additional notes state that cTn — I or T — is the preferred biomarker, if a cTn assay is unavailable the best alternative is CK-MB, and the definition does not require a severe underlying coronary stenosis; myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries (MINOCA) is often used to describe this clinical finding.

### Automated and interpretable patient ECG profiles for disease detection, tracking, and discovery [^111ajHiM]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

A Novel Machine Learning-Based Approach to ECG Segmentation

To develop novel models with the goal of expanding ECG clinical utility, we needed an efficient way to derive patient-specific ECG profiles consisting of vectors of uniform length that capture the variation in ECG voltage over different leads. This first required a method to segment ECGs into their standard, interpretable components.

We first trained a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to delineate individual segments within the ECG. As training data, we downloaded raw ECG voltage data from 2 sources: 112 ECGs from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic databaseand 58 ECGs from the UCSF database. For each ECG, we extracted a 2-second strip and manually assigned to each 1 ms block 1 of 6 possible labels: P wave, PR segment (termination of P wave to start of QRS), QRS complex, ST segment, T wave, and TP segment. Before manual labeling, we performed linear interpolation so that, regardless of the initial ECG sampling frequency, 2 seconds corresponded to an input vector of length 2000.

We then trained a multilayered neural network to detect these segments within an ECG. The architecture of our network was based on the U-net network(Figure 2 A). Our network accepted a 12×2000 input array and was composed of sequential contracting and expanding paths with a total of 32 convolutional layers, 5 max pool layers, and 3 deconvolutional layers. The output of this CNN is a 6×2000 array of ECG segment classes, identical in length to the input vector, and including a probability for each potential segment label at each position along the ECG trace (Note I in the).

### The negative U wave: a pathogenetic enigma but a useful, often overlooked bedside diagnostic and prognostic clue in ischemic heart disease [^113kqeHR]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of U-wave inversion and its clinical value are still not clear, although the U wave was described by Einthoven together with the other electrocardiographic (ECG) waves. Not considered a useful diagnostic clue, it is not usually mentioned in ECG reports. In recent years, stimulated by the long QT syndromes and by the discovery of U-wave changes in some pathologic, mostly cardiac states, this neglected wave has attracted new interest. This review focuses on the negativity of the U wave in ischemic heart disease. The discovery of M cells and their electrophysiology has established the cellular basis for repolarization and has contributed to our knowledge of U-wave genesis. Hemodynamic changes during diastole in acute ischemia also furnish interesting elements for the interpretation of U-wave changes, and some experimental and clinical studies, besides designating stretch as a cause of U-wave changes, have also proved their value for more accurate bedside diagnosis and prognosis. They may indicate the extent of myocardial ischemia, the presence of collateral circulation, and the possible territory and vessel involved. When U-wave changes are the first and only sign of ischemia, they may contribute to a decision regarding the hospital admission of a patient without typical ischemic symptoms. Furthermore, U-wave changes during exercise tests increase their sensitivity.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT correction for gender and age — adult and pediatric limits: It is recommended that, in addition to rate, an adjustment for gender and age be incorporated into QT adjustment, with practical clinical limits that the adjusted QT of 460 ms or longer in women and 450 ms or longer in men be considered a prolonged QT interval and that QT 390 ms and shorter be considered a short QT interval; as a practical compromise for adults, prolonged QT is suggested as women, 460 ms or longer, men, longer than 450 ms, and short QT as women and men, 390 ms or shorter; reported gender differences vary from 6 to 10 ms in older age groups and from 12 to 15 ms in younger adults, becoming small after 40 years of age; in children, the 98th percentile limit for rate-adjusted QT was approximately 450 ms in those younger than 12 years, and a gender difference of 8 ms appeared in the 12- to 16-year age group.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^114ixpHD]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendations — electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy — outline the importance of detecting hypertrophy and the characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. The report states that detection and assessment of cardiac chamber hypertrophy has long been an important objective of clinical electrocardiography and notes that hypertrophy can be reversed with therapy, with adverse clinical outcomes prevented or delayed. Terminology is clarified by using hypertrophy rather than enlargement, explaining that enlargement may imply increased chamber dimension that may not be present in concentric hypertrophy, and noting that distinctive P-wave abnormalities may occur even without atrial hypertrophy or dilation. The principal ECG changes associated with ventricular hypertrophy include increases in QRS amplitude and duration, changes in instantaneous axes and mean QRS vectors, abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves, and abnormalities in the P wave, and these ECG changes have been correlated with direct or indirect assessments of ventricular size or mass to establish diagnostic criteria. Historically, measurement of ventricular mass at autopsy or clinical features served as the reference standards to establish ECG criteria.

T-wave abnormalities — normal polarity by age and quantitative amplitude thresholds are detailed: in children older than 1 month, the T wave is often inverted in V1, V2, and V3; in adolescents 12 years old and older and in young adults less than 20 years of age, the T wave may be slightly inverted in aVF and inverted in V2; in adults 20 years old and older, the normal T wave is inverted in aVR, upright or inverted in aVL, III, and V1, and upright in I, II, and V3 through V6. In lateral chest leads V5 and V6, the T wave is slightly negative (less than 0.1 mV) in 2% of white men and women 60 years of age and older and in 2% of black men and women 40 years of age and older, and it is negative by 0.1 mV or more in 5% of black men and women 60 years of age and older. In normal adults, the T-wave amplitude is most positive in V2 or V3, with upper normal thresholds for V2 from 1.0 to 1.4 mV in men (up to 1.6 mV in the 18- to 29-year age group) and from 0.7 up to 1.0 mV in women. Quantitative descriptors propose reporting T waves in I, II, aVL, and V2 to V6 as inverted when the T-wave amplitude is from −0.1 to −0.5 mV, as deep negative from −0.5 to −1.0 mV, and as giant negative when less than −1.0 mV; additionally, a T wave may be called low when its amplitude is less than 10% of the R-wave amplitude and flat when the peak T-wave amplitude is between 0.1 and −0.1 mV (with an R wave taller than 0.3 mV).

### Amiodarone-induced T-U fusion [^1164UXYF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug for various atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It has the potential to cause prolongation of the QT interval, which, in turn, can increases the incidence of torsade de pointes. Amiodarone is also one of the causes of prominent U waves. The presented case exemplifies the phenomenon of amiodarone-induced T-U fusion and QT prolongation. Other causes of QT prolongation as electrolyte abnormalities or administration of other drugs that prolong the QT interval were excluded. Awareness of this phenomenon and method of calculation of QT interval in this scenario is of utmost importance.

### Procainamide hydrochloride [^111QBcyx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Complete Heart Block: Procainamide should not be administered to patients with complete heart block because of its effects in suppressing nodal or ventricular pacemakers and the hazard of asystole. It may be difficult to recognize complete heart block in patients with ventricular tachycardia, but if significant slowing of ventricular rate occurs during PA treatment without evidence of A-V conduction appearing, PA should be stopped. In cases of second degree A-V block or various types of hemiblock, PA should be avoided or discontinued because of the possibility of increased severity of block, unless the ventricular rate is controlled by an electrical pacemaker.

Idiosyncratic Hypersensitivity: In patients sensitive to procaine or other ester-type local anesthetics, cross sensitivity to PA is unlikely. However, it should be borne in mind, and PA should not be used if it produces acute allergic dermatitis, asthma, or anaphylactic symptoms.

Lupus Erythematosus: An established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is a contraindication to PA therapy, since aggravation of symptoms is highly likely.

Torsades de Pointes: In the unusual ventricular arrhythmia called "les torsades de pointes" (twistings of the points), characterized by alternation of one or more ventricular premature beats in the directions of the QRS complexes on ECG in persons with prolonged Q-T and often enhanced U waves, Group 1A antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Administration of PA in such cases may aggravate this special type of ventricular extrasystole or tachycardia instead of suppressing it.

### Appearance of electrocardiographic initial U-wave inversion dependent on pressure-induced early diastolic impairment in patients with hypertension [^114KUh7g]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

ECG U-wave inversion can be classified as initial and terminal U inversion according to the phasic relationship to positive U-wave deflection. Initial U inversion is occasionally observed in hypertensive patients while terminal U inversion frequently appears during severe myocardial ischemia.

Hypothesis

The genesis of initial U inversion may be related to pressure-induced diastolic dysfunction.

Methods

In order to clarify the genesis of initial U-wave inversion we studied 11 consecutive hypertensive patients with both initial U inversion and impaired left ventricular early relaxation who were evaluated using Doppler echocardiography.

Results

The U inversion disappeared during acute pressure lowering by sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. The U inversion also disappeared and relaxation improved significantly after chronic blood pressure lowering. Initial U inversion reappeared during a cold pressor test.

Conclusion

The appearance of initial U inversion was dependent on the pressure-induced impaired left ventricular early relaxation in hypertensive patients.

### Contribution of fetal magnetocardiography to diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of fetal arrhythmia [^112zgcyN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Fetal Tachycardia

Tachycardias that are slower than 200 beats/min were more likely to be referred for fMCG, because of less perceived need for immediate treatment; thus atrial ectopic tachycardia was overrepresented. It was often difficult by echocardiography/Doppler to differentiate sinus tachycardia from atrial ectopic tachycardia. Rapid re‐entrant tachycardias are more recognizable echocardiographically. Tachyarrhythmias may coexist, making the diagnosis even more difficult, such as SVT and atrial flutter, or TdP and atrial flutter. Likewise, they can be paroxysmal and brief like junctional ectopic tachycardia, and some TdP, requiring continuous recording to detect. fMCG demonstrated drug effect on fetal cardiac time intervals during transplacental therapy. This allowed modification of dosing and abandonment of toxic, ineffective, or proarrhythmic therapies.

–RelatedProlongation

In this series, QTc prolongation (QTc > 500 ms) not only accompanied familial and de novo LQTS but was also seen in other conditions. QTc prolongation may accompany myocarditis, maternal nutritional deficiency states, or maternal use of QT‐prolonging medications. Since many of these risks are modifiable, knowing the QTc in association with an arrhythmia is advantageous, though in the case of sinus bradycardia, or fetuses with prominent U waves producing QTUc prolongation, it can be a source of overdiagnosis of LQTS. We recently reported our method for distinguishing benign U waves from pathologic U waves.

Limitations

It is likely that pregnancies with more severe arrhythmias were referred for fMCG. The perceived clinical need for referral may also have been higher in certain categories (familial LQTS). Fetal echocardiography and fMCG are complementary and synergistic techniques, each having strengths and limitations in the diagnosis of fetal arrhythmias.

### Does glycemic control reverse dispersion of ventricular repolarization in type 2 diabetes? [^112AUrZc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

ECG recordings and measurements

Standard resting 12-lead ECGs were recorded at 25 mm/s paper speed and 10 mm/mV amplitude. The beginning of the QT interval was defined as first deflection of the QRS complex. The end of the T wave was defined as the intersection of the tangent to the down slope of the T wave and the isoelectric line when not followed by a U wave or if distinct from the following U wave. If a U wave followed by the T wave, T wave offset was measured as the nadir between the T and U waves. In case of a flat T wave or TU merge without nadir, the end of the T wave could not be determined and the lead was excluded from measurements. The QT intervals were measured in all 12 leads and corrected for heart rate (QTc) by Bazett's formula, together with a sex-specific method described by Rautaharju and Zhang according to AHA/ACCF/HRS guidelines. QT dispersion and QTc dispersion were calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum QT interval and QTc interval, respectively, among the 12 leads. Tpeak-Tend was defined as the interval from the peak of positive T wave and the end of the T wave and was measured in lead V5.

Statistical analysis

Numeric variables are expressed as means ± SD. Differences between two groups were tested by Student's t -test. Relationships between parameters were examined by the use of simple linear regression analyses. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between clinical parameters, QT dispersion and Tpeak-Tend. Changes in clinical and electrocardiographic variables and medication during follow-up periods within the type 2 diabetes group (36 patients) were compared by the paired t -test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. Statistical analyses were carried out using JMP (version11 SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). To calculate statistical power for differences in QT dispersion and Tpeak-Tend, we used "Power and Sample Size Calculation version 3.0.43, 2011". All statistical tests were two-tailed and differences were considered to be statistically significant if p was less than 0.05.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^114VhQjk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Methadone is associated with a disproportionate risk of sudden death and ventricular tachyarrhythmia despite only modest inhibition of delayed rectifier K + current (I Kr), the principal mechanism of drug‐associated arrhythmia. Congenital defects of inward rectifier K + current (I K1) have been linked to increased U‐wave amplitude on ECG and fatal arrhythmia. We hypothesized that methadone may also be a potent inhibitor of I K1, contributing to delayed repolarization and manifesting on surface ECGs as augmented U‐wave integrals.

Methods and Results

Using a whole‐cell voltage clamp, methadone inhibited both recombinant and native I K1 with a half‐maximal inhibitory concentration IC50) of 1.5 μmol/L, similar to that observed for I Kr block (half‐maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.9 μmol/L). Methadone modestly increased the action potential duration at 90% repolarization and slowed terminal repolarization at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, action potential duration at 90% repolarization lengthening was abolished, but its effect on terminal repolarization rose steadily and correlated with increased fluctuations of diastolic membrane potential. In parallel, patient ECGs were analyzed before and after methadone initiation, with 68% of patients having a markedly increased U‐wave integral compared with premethadone (lead V3; mean +38% ± 15%, P = 0.016), along with increased QT and T Peak to T End intervals, likely reflective of I Kr block.

Conclusions

Methadone is a potent I K1 inhibitor that causes augmentation of U waves on surface ECG. We propose that increased membrane instability resulting from I K1 block may better explain methadone's arrhythmia risk beyond I Kr inhibition alone. Drug‐induced augmentation of U waves may represent evidence of blockade of multiple repolarizing ion channels, and evaluation of the effect of that agent on I K1 may be warranted.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of QT intervals in sequential tracings — serial electrocardiogram (ECG) comparisons are essential for identification of drug‑induced QT prolongation and are helpful as an adjunct to ST analysis for detecting active ischemia; when comparing tracings, time of day, recording systems, measurement programs, and QT‑rate formulas can differ, there is significant interreader variability, and rigorous standardization should be followed. The FDA guide for industry suggests reporting two levels of change in the rate‑corrected QT from baseline in serial ECGs: an increase of greater than 30 ms and an increase of greater than 60 ms. It is recommended that for serial comparisons ECG recorders meet specific performance standards and, if possible, be of the same type; that uniform, carefully standardized ECG acquisition and QT‑measurement procedures be used; and that, whenever possible, a single reader be responsible for overreading sequential tracings of an individual patient or research subject.

T-wave alternans — definition, measurement, and clinical significance: T-wave alternans signifies T-wave amplitude variations that alternate every second beat and is typically observed as microvolt-level variation; it indicates latent instability of repolarization predictive of malignant arrhythmias; it is generally not present at the resting state even in high-risk patients, and a stress test (exercise or pharmacological stress or pacing), requiring special equipment and analysis software, is needed to provoke it; although its clinical utility has not been fully defined, it holds substantial potential in identifying patients at high risk of serious arrhythmic events.

Exercise stress testing for detecting inducible ischaemia was first introduced in the 1950s and remained one of the only methods of stressing the heart for years to come. The presence of inducible ischaemia was assessed by ECG changes during exercise apart from other factors, namely, duration of exercise, blood pressure and heart rate response, metabolic equivalents achieved, etc. With the emergence of other tests to look for inducible ischaemia, for example, dobutamine stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning and also as the threshold for invasive evaluation has decreased, unusual and infrequently encountered ECG changes are not looked for during exercise stressing with the same degree of diligence. The authors describe below the case of a 49-year-old male whose left anterior descending artery stenosis was diagnosed on exercise stress test on the basis of a negative U wave.

U Wave in Drug‐Associated Arrhythmia Risk Assessment

In our study of ECG changes in humans, methadone induction resulted in significantly prolonged terminal repolarization as manifested by U‐wave augmentation and lengthening of the T Peak to T End interval. The current study therefore introduces proof‐of‐concept for a potentially new paradigm for understanding the mechanism of methadone's distinct arrhythmia risk. Additionally, the data strengthen the proposed association between I K1 blockade and U‐wave amplitude, which suggests that the U‐wave integral could serve as a novel tool for the evaluation of drug‐induced loss of repolarization reserve when assessing drug safety.

The International Conference on Harmonization guidance for assessing the proarrhythmic potential for nonantiarrhythmic drugs recommends reporting changes in U‐wave morphology, but not their magnitude or duration, during new drug development. This lack of emphasis was attributed to uncertainty regarding the predictive value of the U wave. This document, released in 2005, reflected the prevailing belief that U waves are a normal finding of unclear provenance. Using clinical data from individuals having either gain‐ or loss‐of‐function variants in KCNJ2, however, Postema et alshowed that a genetically determined reduction in I K1 resulted in an increase in U‐wave magnitude, while an increase in I K1 had the opposite effect. When combined with our findings, the totality of experimental and clinical data support the contention that the U wave represents a voltage gradient persisting in the terminal phase of repolarization, ie, beyond 90% repolarization of the ventricles, and that its amplitude reflects the time course of the terminal portion of phase 3. Whether inclusion of the U wave in future arrhythmic prediction models is justified will depend on the results of studies employing quantitatively precise methods similar to those presented here.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. We did not measure serum methadone levels in patients undergoing methadone induction, as this is not routinely performed in clinical practice. Therefore, we cannot precisely correlate pharmacokinetics with either the QT interval or the degree of suppression of I K1 or I Kr in the heart. Published values of the maxium concentration for methadone in patients undergoing opioid replacement therapy are 5‐ to 10‐fold lower than the IC 50 for suppression of I K1 and I Kr as reported here; however, cardiac tissue levels of methadone may be significantly higher than measured blood levels. Indeed, we observed QT prolongation in patients following methadone induction, indicative of significant suppression of I Kr, and likely I K1 as well. However, we observed no cardiac arrhythmias or arrest in patients involved in the study. Additionally, the ECGs were obtained under clinical conditions and not as part of a focused QT study. We observed an increase in the mean number of DADs in a dose‐dependent manner. While the appearance of DADs is not pathognomonic for membrane instability, the confluence of APD prolongation, increased beat‐to‐beat variability of APD, increased diastolic variance, and increased DADs promote phase 4 instability and enhanced arrhythmogenicity. Finally, we did not examine methadone's effects in a whole‐heart or intact animal model of chronic use, which would permit the induction of sustained arrhythmias.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that methadone blocks both the inward rectifier and rapid component of the delayed rectifier K + currents, resulting in the slowing of terminal repolarization and an increase in U‐wave integral on the surface ECG. This dual inhibitory action may figure importantly in methadone's evident and unique association with lethal arrhythmia. Neither the inward rectifier current nor the U wave are currently interrogated in drug development. We believe that consideration should be given to the addition of these complementary in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic targets in the evaluation of proarrhythmic liability.

AHA/ACCF/HRS electrocardiogram (ECG) repolarization segments and waves — The ST segment corresponds to the plateau phase of the ventricular transmembrane action potential, with slow voltage change and only small voltage gradients; the absence of significant gradients during the ST and TP segments explains why they are normally nearly flat and at approximately the same level, that is, isoelectric. Electric diastole corresponds to the TP segment when ventricular myocardial cells are at their resting transmembrane potential of approximately −85 mV. The T wave corresponds to the phase of rapid ventricular repolarization (phase 3) of the ventricular action potential. Abnormalities in the ST segment, T wave, and duration of the QT interval reflect abnormalities in ventricular repolarization, and the U wave most likely represents an electromechanical phenomenon that occurs after repolarization is completed.

ATP1A3 Genotype Is Not Associated With Other Significant ECG Parameter Changes

To determine whether repolarization was the only electrocardiographic parameter impacted by the ATP1A3 genotype, we compared other ECG measurements among subgroups. The QRS duration did not significantly differ between any of the groups. Individuals with typical AHC had a slightly left‐shifted QRS axis compared with those with atypical AHC (63.1 ± 3.6 versus 80.7 ± 7.3; P = 0.03). There were no other differences in ECG parameters. Additionally, when comparing the ECG parameters of patients who were genotype‐positive with those who were genotype‐negative, there were no significant differences in any of the examined ECG parameters. Finally, when the ATP1A3 genotype–positive individuals were compared with ATP1A3 genotype–negative individuals, there were no significant differences in any ECG parameters except a modest change in P‐wave axis (54.6 ± 2.3 versus 43.3 ± 4.3; P = 0.01).

Other repolarization characteristics were assessed and were rarely abnormal without a clear association with genotype. Marked J‐point elevation was not seen. Mild ST elevation, which was consistent with early repolarization, was occasionally observed, most often with 1‐mV elevation in the anterolateral leads. Specifically, 2 out of the 9 patients (22%) with the ATP1A3‐D801N variant were found to have early repolarization in the anterolateral leads. When analyzing the inferior leads, 1 out of 9 patients (11%) with the ATP1A3‐D801N variant were found to have early repolarization. None of these patients had early repolarization in the septal leads. No septal lead J‐point elevation was observed in general. Abnormal T‐wave morphology was rare and found in 3 patients (4.8%) who demonstrated isoelectric T waves in inferior and anterolateral leads. U waves were not a common feature and were observed in 2 patients (3.2%). A summary of the ECG parameters can be found in Table 2. Overall, these findings suggest that repolarization timing (QT/QTc) is the predominant ECG difference when comparing AHC and ATP1A3 status.

### Comparison of two highly automated ECG algorithms for detection of drug-induced cardiac ion channel block [^116FGphx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Contrary to the J‐T peak c results, the presence of outliers among the FDA‐measured T peak –T end values resulted in a longer average. Analysis of waveforms and annotations in outlier cases (Figure 3) indicated that the FDA algorithm may estimate a longer T peak –T end for two reasons. First, selecting the first peak on a notched T‐wave as the T‐peak results in longer T peak –T end. Second, T‐offset detection by the FDA algorithm seemed to be biased by the presence of U‐waves, especially when the T‐wave was flat (Figure 3 b). The same bias also resulted in longer QTcF values. The alternative software consistently excluded the U‐wave from offset of the T‐wave.

While this study corroborates the FDA methods and findings, the observation of differences between the two methods is also helpful. Although there is no gold standard by which the correctness of findings by one or the other algorithm can be judged, the consistency of the interval readings is important. Reductions in variability can improve confidence in study interpretation, increase specificity (i.e. reduce false positives), reduce the sample study size required for endpoint determination, and potentially reduce cost. While it is possible that the smaller variance in intervals measured with the alternative technique might have been due to measurement error, the analysis of the repeatability standard deviation within the 5‐min timepoints suggests that improved consistency of measurements contributed to the reduction in CI. ECGs recorded in individual resting subjects during a 5‐min interval would be expected to be nearly identical. Thus, variation of those values is a more precise test of measurement repeatability than the assessments done on the whole population over all timepoints, because those assessments include intersubject variability and drug‐ and circadian‐related intertimepoint variability, in addition to measurement variability.

### Calmodulin inhibitor W-7 unmasks a novel electrocardiographic parameter that predicts initiation of torsade de pointes [^114MK99x]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

We have shown that the calmodulin inhibitor W-7 suppresses torsade de pointes (TdP) without shortening the QT interval, which is consistent with other findings that QT prolongation, per se, is insufficient to generate TdP. ECGs were analyzed from a well-characterized animal model of TdP to identify more reliable predictors of this life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.

Methods and Results

TdP was induced using methoxamine and clofilium in 12 of 14 rabbits pretreated with vehicle control, whereas pretreatment with W-7 (50 micromol/kg), an inhibitor of the intracellular Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin, significantly suppressed TdP induction (1 of 11 rabbits with TdP, P < 0.001). W-7 did not affect heart rate, increases in QT intervals, or dispersion compared with measurements in vehicle-treated control animals. However, a progressive and significant increase in the ratio of U-wave to T-wave amplitude (UTA) occurred before TdP onset in control animals, and this was prevented by W-7.

Conclusions

Selective suppression of TdP inducibility by W-7, without shortening the duration of cardiac repolarization, allowed identification of the UTA ratio as a new electrocardiographic index for predicting TdP onset. These findings are consistent with the idea that prolonged repolarization is not the proximate cause of arrhythmia initiation, and they suggest that an increased UTA ratio reflects activation of intracellular Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes that are required for triggering TdP in this model.

Correction for QRS duration — use of JT interval and automated formulas: The QT interval prolongs in ventricular conduction defects, and an adjustment for QRS duration becomes necessary, which can be accomplished best by incorporating QRS duration and RR interval as covariates into the QT-adjustment formula or by using the JT interval (QT duration–QRS duration), and if the JT interval is chosen, normal standards established specifically for the JT interval should be used; QT- and JT-adjustment formulas have recently been introduced for prolonged ventricular conduction and, with confirmation, may be incorporated into automated algorithms to provide appropriate correction factors.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^114WJd7L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

U Waves

Characterization of U waves was determined by extracting individual ECG lead signals (500 Hz sampling rate, 0.5–150 Hz band‐pass filter) from exported XML files. The mean single‐cycle ECG complex for a given lead was extracted from each 10.6‐second ECG record. The time course of late T‐ and U‐wave components of the mean complex, y T+U, was reproduced using a nonlinear least‐squares fit of the function:where A T and A U are scaling constants for the T‐ and U‐wave components, respectively, τ T and τ U are time constants for the T and U components, and t P is a time delay. The first term corresponds to a declining exponential representing the terminal phase of the T wave. The second term is an approximation to a time‐dependent normal distribution representing the U‐wave component of the ECG signal. A fitting routine based on the Levenberg‐Marquardt minimization algorithm optimized the 5 parameters A T, A U, τ T, τ U, and t P to minimize the sum of the squared residuals of the fit. Parameters were constrained to be > 0.

Statistical Analysis

Paired ECG samples (n = 77) were evaluated for statistically significant differences using a paired, 2‐tailed Student t test. Samples were tested (Shapiro‐Wilk test) and found to be normally distributed. Correlations were calculated using Spearman r coefficient. Because of the expected diminution of the U‐wave integral magnitude at higher heart rates, we prespecified a constrained analysis of ECG pairs limited to a heart rate < 85 beats per minute (n = 41). We compared pre‐post changes with a 2‐tailed paired Student t test. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons as appropriate. A paired t test was used to compare the use of prescription and illicit QTc‐prolonging drug proportions before and after methadone induction and stabilization. All statistical analyses were performed using IDL software (L3Harris Geospatial). A P < 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.

### Prominent U-waves without QT prolongation in X-linked creatine transporter deficiency caused by SLC6A8 variants [^117MNCNG]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is a rare X-linked disease caused by SLC6A8 variants, which impair ATP-dependent energy metabolism in neurons and myocytes. While the neurological and muscular manifestations are well characterized, the cardiac phenotype remains poorly understood. Early clinical reports and a transgenic mouse model have raised concerns about possible associations with QTc prolongation and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Objective

To characterize the cardiac phenotype of male CTD patients.

Methods

This cross-sectional study prospectively included male CTD patients with confirmed SLC6A8 pathogenic variants. A systematic cardiological evaluation was performed, including 12-lead resting ECG, ambulatory ECG (Holter monitoring), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and biological analysis.

Results

Twenty-three male CTD patients (median [IQR] age, 17.1 [13.5–20.5] years) with 20 distinct SLC6A8 variants were included. Prominent U-waves were observed in 82.6% of resting ECGs and 95% of ambulatory ECGs; biphasic T-waves in 30.4% and 90%, respectively. No patient had a prolonged QTc interval (median [IQR] QTc, 431 [411–443] ms) when the U-waves were excluded. Repolarization abnormalities were not secondary to electrolyte disorders. No sustained arrhythmias or conduction disorders were observed. No patient reported syncope or cardiac arrest. TTE revealed no cardiomyopathy or congenital heart defects. Two patients had mildly elevated NT-proBNP with no clinical or imaging abnormalities.

Conclusion

This study highlighted an atypical ventricular repolarization pattern in CTD patients (prominent U-waves and biphasic T-waves) without QTc prolongation. Long-term follow-up data are needed to establish its prognosis, but it must be distinguished from long-QT syndrome. No patient met diagnostic criteria for cardiomyopathy or congenital heart defect.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^117Eu9Rw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

A negative T‐wave in ECG registered at 50 years of age in asymptomatic individuals from a randomized observational cohort carried an increased risk of all‐cause and CV death during lifetime follow‐up. The enhanced risk remained after adjustment for other ECG abnormalities and other CV risk factors. A major T‐wave inversion conveyed a higher risk than minor and a negative T‐wave carried enhanced risk also in the absence of other risk factors.

### The arrhythmogenic cardiotoxicity of the quinoline and structurally related antimalarial drugs: a systematic review [^111DyLpn]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This work has highlighted important methodological issues which confounded a standardised assessment of the cardiovascular effects of the quinoline and structurally related antimalarial drugs. There is considerable variation in the recording and measurement of the QT interval in antimalarial drug trials. The QT interval is technically difficult to measure, even by experts, and the process of measurement introduces further confounding factors and systematic error. There is also substantial variation in the interpretation and reporting of the QT interval in a clinical context.

Automated measurements are considered not as accurate or reliable compared with manual measurements. Many machines have problems with identifying U waves which can be mistaken for the T wave: a recent trial assessing high-dose DP was stopped because of apparent QT prolongation when the machine read the QU interval as the QT interval. T and U wave morphology can be difficult to identify even manually, and readings are subject to a high degree of inter-user variability. For paper recordings, a slower speed of recording, at 25 mm/s rather than 50 mm/s, makes the interval more difficult to measure if manual readings are employed. Some recent studies have used computer-aided ECG interpretation by specialist personnel at centralised laboratories. Whilst some investigators take multiple QT interval measurements across different leads and calculate an average, there is no agreement over this method. There are also many definitions of the end of the T wave used by trials.

Another source of potential confusion is the heart rate correction. This is necessary because the QT interval has an inverse relationship with heart rate. Several correction formulae are used, but the choice of the best formula is the subject of ongoing debate. The most widely used are Bazett's and Fridericia's formulae. In a healthy population, Bazett's formula overestimates at higher heart rates (lengthens the QTc interval) and underestimates at lower heart rates (shortens the QTc interval). In healthy subjects, Fridericia's provides better, although still imperfect correction at heart rates < 60 and > 100 beats per minute. Where possible, the QT correction formula used should be derived for the study population, but this requires a large study and sufficient variation in heart rates.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^115bmhrP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this translational investigation combining the study of recombinant ion channels, freshly isolated cardiac myocytes, and human patients, several novel observations emerge that could explain a disproportionate occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia among methadone‐treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate methadone blockade of I K1 at clinically relevant concentrations comparable to its effect on I Kr current. In agreement with this inhibitory action on I K1, higher doses of methadone caused progressive slowing of terminal repolarization and increased the incidence of delayed afterdepolarizations consistent with reduced cardiac membrane stability. On ECG analysis, methadone induction resulted in significantly prolonged terminal repolarization as manifested by U‐wave augmentation and lengthening of the T Peak −T End interval. Pursuing parallel tracks of investigation, the current study therefore offers new insight into the potential mechanism of methadone's distinct arrhythmia risk, strengthens the proposed association between I K1 blockade and U‐wave augmentation, and, more broadly, suggests that the U‐wave integral could serve as a novel parameter for evaluation of drug‐induced loss of repolarization reserve.

### Assessment of the ECG T-Wave in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116oEiUn]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolongation of the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave (Tp-Te) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to clarify associations between Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/rate-corrected QT (QTc) with clinical severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and clinical outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective study included 222 patients with acute SAH (group S) and 306 patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms (group U). Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/QTc were manually measured in standard 12-lead ECG recordings on admission and comparisons made between patients in groups S and U. The relationships of these ECG parameters with Hunt and Hess grade and Glasgow outcome scale were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for confounding factors.

Results

Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/QTc were significantly greater in group S than in group U (group S: 109 ± 30, 0.26 ± 0.07, and 0.24 ± 0.06ms; group U: 84 ± 12, 0.22 ± 0.03, and 0.21 ± 0.03ms, respectively; P < 0.0001). In addition, in the multiple logistic regression analyses these variables were positively correlated with the Hunt and Hess grade (Tp-Te odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.414 [1.375–4.238], P = 0.002; Tp-Te/QT, 1.886 [1.085–3.277], P = 0.024; Tp-Te/QTc, 1.873 [1.07–3.278], P = 0.028, and negatively correlated with Glasgow outcome scale Tp-Te odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 4.168 [2.409–7.209], P < 0.001; Tp-Te/QT, 2.434 [1.413–4.192], P = 0.001; Tp-Te/QTc 2.953 [1.703–5.123], P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/QTc are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome in patients with SAH.

### An open label, adaptive, phase 1 trial of high-dose oral nitazoxanide in healthy volunteers: an antiviral candidate for SARS-CoV-2 [^117FwsMF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety results

Nitazoxanide was safe with acceptable tolerance at 1,500 mg twice daily for 7 days with no significant AEs (Table 3). Moderate GI disturbance (sufficient to interfere with daily activities) was seen in three participants (21.4%) with a further eight participants (57.1%) experiencing mild GI symptoms (covering a spectrum of nausea, bloating, constipation, diarrhea or loose stools, and/or abdominal pain). Yellow discoloration of the urine and sclera was observed in 12 (85.7%) and 9 (64.3%) participants, respectively, without clinically significant elevation in bilirubin. This was self‐limiting and resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. No grade 3 or 4 AEs were documented.

Table 3
AEs and SAEs

Minor, self‐resolving, postdose elevation in creatine kinase (CK) was identified in 5 of 14 participants (maximum 869 U/L at D5 postdose; Table S4). One of the participants reported mild localized myalgia without muscle tenderness at D5 (CK 508 U/L), which was recorded as an AE. All other elevations were not considered clinically significant.

In one participant, tachycardia (heart rate 112 bpm) developed shortly after the second dose administration on day 1, with an ECG recorded 7 minutes following the second dose showing a corrected QTcB (using Bazett's formula) of 468 msec, an apparent increase of 73.5 msec above the mean baseline (394.5 msec; Figure S2). Treatment was discontinued in all being dosed. Following overnight admission for observation and serial ECGs (SAE; Table 3), an apparent prolongation recurred at 5 hours and 44 minutes following the second dose, 460 msec (65.5 msec above baseline mean, heart rate 87 bpm) and resolved fully thereafter. Independent cardiology review of all ECGs with manual QT and QTcB calculations confirmed an artifactual QTcB increase due to the presence of a prominent U‐wave fused with the end of the T wave, causing the ECG machine to calculate the QU interval instead of the QT interval. Following formal review by the trial SRC and in consultation with the UK medicines regulator, the trial (which had been temporarily suspended) was reopened at the same dose level with replacement of 2 participants who discontinued dosing after only 1 full day. Additional ECGs were obtained at 14 hours post first‐dose on day 1 and day 5 for subsequent participants, with no significant changes observed.

### Redefinition of the Q wave – is there a clinical problem? [^117NaXvz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the potential consequences of the redefined joint European/American electrocardiographic criteria for an established myocardial infarction (MI). New and previous diagnostic Q-wave criteria were used in patients with stable angina pectoris. Seventy-nine patients with and 77 patients without a documented previous MI were compared using the results of myocardial perfusion imaging at rest as a reference. With the new Q-wave criteria, 71% of the former group and 40% of the latter had evidence of established MI compared with 33% and 3% when using the previous criteria (p < 0.0001). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 71%, 60%, 64%, and 67% for the new criteria versus 33%, 97%, 93%, and 59% with the previous criteria. These data suggest that that the new Q-wave criteria may be too nonspecific, resulting in an inappropriately high number of false-positive results.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT correction for rate — preferred methods and reporting thresholds: It is recommended that linear regression functions rather than the Bazett's formula be used for QT-rate correction and that the method used for rate correction be identified in ECG analysis reports, and rate correction of the QT interval should not be attempted when RR interval variability is large or when identification of the end of the T wave is unreliable; Bazett's formula leaves a strong positive residual correlation (r = 0.32) and Fridericia's formula leaves a negative correlation (r = −0.26 to −0.32) with heart rate, and the adjusted QT values may be substantially in error, particularly when the heart rate is high; FDA guidelines for industry recommend that 3 severity levels for rate-corrected QT be reported when considering possible QT-prolonging effects of drugs: longer than 350 ms, longer than 480 ms, and longer than 500 ms.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^111L7C2T]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Premonitory ECG signs of torsade de pointes (TdP) — risk increases with corrected QT interval (QTc), as each 10‑ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% exponential increase in risk; a patient with a QTc of 500 ms has a 63% to 97% higher risk than a patient with a QTc of 440 ms, and data from congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) indicate that a QTc > 500 ms is associated with a 2‑ to 3‑fold higher risk, with similar increased risk in drug‑induced TdP when QTc > 500 ms is exceeded. There is no threshold of QT prolongation at which TdP is certain to occur; before onset, a short‑long‑short R‑R sequence is associated with marked QT prolongation and T‑U–wave distortion, TdP is especially likely when QT prolongation reflects an increase in Tpeak–Tend, and exaggerated QT‑interval prolongation with T‑U distortion after a pause should be considered a strong marker of risk for TdP.

### Severe hypokalemia, paralysis, and AIDS-associated isospora belli diarrhea [^112wEqRF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia of clinical significance, severe enough to cause paralysis and cardiac dysrhythmias, is an uncommon life-threatening medical disorder. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP), where an abrupt intracellular shift of potassium has occurred, must be distinguished from hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (non-HPP), where a total body potassium deficit exists. The challenge for emergency physicians is to swiftly and accurately differentiate disease etiology and institute prompt treatment. Aggressive potassium repletion, required in non-HPP etiologies, may predispose HPP patients to dangerous and potentially fatal rebound hyperkalemia as the intracellular potassium shift resolves.

Objectives

Describe the process by which HPP and non-HPP can be differentiated on clinical and laboratory grounds leading to appropriate resuscitation from severe and clinically relevant hypokalemia. Chronic diarrhea syndromes and possibly normal alkaline phosphatase levels alert the clinician to the potential for non-HPP.

Case Report

A case of HIV/AIDS-associated isospora belli diarrheal illness with severe hypokalemia of the non-HPP type is presented. Historical, laboratory, and clinical findings, which assisted in the differentiation from HPP, are emphasized. Clinical progression and treatment strategies, as well as electrocardiogram findings with T-U-P fusion waves, are described in detail.

Conclusion

The history, especially the time course of disease, is essential in differentiating HPP and non-HPP, allowing treatment to proceed without overcorrection and rebound hyperkalemia. Although other infectious diseases have been linked to non-HPP, to our knowledge this is the first report linking non-HPP to isospora belli diarrheal illness.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^1139UEzN]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) prevention in hospital settings — among patients who receive QT-prolonging drugs in hospital units with continuous ECG monitoring, TdP should be avoidable if there is an awareness of individual risk factors and the ECG signs of drug-induced LQTS. Key ECG risk factors include marked QT prolongation to > 500 ms (with the exception of amiodarone- or verapamil-induced QT prolongation), marked QT-U prolongation and distortion after a pause, onset of ventricular ectopy and couplets, macroscopic T-wave alternans, or episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that are initiated with a short-long-short R-R cycle sequence (typically, PVC–compensatory pause–PVC). Recognition of these ECG harbingers of TdP allows for treatment with intravenous magnesium, removal of the offending agent, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities and other exacerbating factors, including the prevention of bradycardia and long pauses with temporary pacing if necessary.

### Electromechanical reciprocity and arrhythmogenesis in long-QT syndrome and beyond [^115Ypj1F]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to this evidence of mechanically induced arrhythmia formation, the above-discussed hypothesis for the mechano-electric origin of the U wave (coinciding with the end of mechanical systole) may also suggest a potential role of intrinsic mechanical alterations/stretch for arrhythmia initiation. If the end of the mechanical systole causes the electrical phenomenon of a U wave, then it can be reasoned that in certain conditions, when mechanically induced electrical changes reach a certain threshold, these may also cause abnormal impulse formation and even VT. Is there any clinical evidence that abnormal impulse formation with a similar (late) timing after the T wave may initiate VT/VF in SQTS? In a comprehensive analysis of VT/VF initiation in 73 SQTS patients, two different types of coupling intervals that initiated the arrhythmia were identified: very short coupling intervals of around 230 ms with PVCs falling into the T wave, and longer coupling intervals of around 350 ms with PVCs that appeared after the end of the T wave — around the time when a U wave could be appreciated on the surface ECG of SQTS patients - suggesting mechanically induced ectopy. Interestingly, in transgenic SQTS rabbits, spontaneous couplets and triplets selectively emerged with a longer coupling interval well after the end of the T wave. Thus far, no mechanical assessments were made at the time of PVC occurrence. These would be important to elucidate a potential temporal relation between mechanical alterations and PVCs.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part IV: the ST segment, T and U waves, and the QT interval: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^116rE22j]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT interval measurement and interpretation — definition, interlead variability, lead selection, handling U waves, automation, and validation: The QT interval is defined from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave, with key challenges including recognizing the onset and end points, selecting appropriate lead(s), and adjusting for QRS duration, gender, and rate. The onset of the QRS complex tends to occur up to 20 ms earlier in V2 and V3 than in the limb leads, and interlead QT differences of up to 50 ms have been regarded as normal, with others suggesting up to 65 ms, and this value is reported to be less in women than in men. When measuring QT in individual leads, the lead showing the longest QT should be used, usually V2 or V5; if the longest value differs by more than 40 ms from other leads, the measurement may be in error and adjacent leads should be considered. If T and U waves are superimposed or cannot be separated, it is recommended that the QT be measured in leads not showing U waves (often aVR and aVL) or by extending a tangent to the steepest proportion of the T-wave downslope to the TP segment, although defining the end of the T wave in these ways might underestimate the QT interval. Automated simultaneous-lead recordings often yield a longer QT than any single lead and may invalidate older normal values, and in view of the clinical importance of the QT-interval prolongation, it is essential to visually validate QT-interval prolongation reported by a computer algorithm. QT prolongation can result from conditions such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, and its presence on an ECG report should call for a careful clinical evaluation of possible causes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome — clinical features and risks include that marked QT prolongation with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs and most cases display a "short-long-short" sequence before tachycardia. QT intervals, uncorrected for rate, are generally greater than 500 ms, prominent U waves are common, and marked QTU prolongation may be evident only on postpause beats. Genetic susceptibility may contribute, with commoner DNA variants having frequencies ranging up to 15% of some populations. Presentations include incidental detection, palpitations, syncope due to prolonged episodes of torsades de pointes, or sudden cardiac death. The QT-prolonging agent d-sotalol increased mortality in a large randomized clinical trial, and in the DIAMOND trial, 3.3% of patients with severe heart failure (HF) had torsades de pointes during the first 72 h of dofetilide therapy.

### Sympathomimetic infusion and cardiac repolarization: the normative effects of epinephrine and isoproterenol in healthy subjects [^111HMxZF]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catecholamines are known to affect cardiac repolarization, and provocation with either isoproterenol or epinephrine has been proposed as a tool for uncovering latent repolarization abnormalities. This study systematically compares the effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine infusions on QT interval (QT), T waves and U waves in normal subjects.

Methods and Results

Twenty-four normal subjects (29 ± 8 years) were evaluated during graded infusions of up to 0.30 microg/kg/minute epinephrine and 5.0 microg/minute isoproterenol. Heart rates at peak doses were 81 ± 13 bpm at 0.28 ± 0.04 microg/kg/minute epinephrine and 104 ± 5 bpm at 2.4 microg/minute isoproterenol. The longest absolute QT increase was 4 ± 5 msec above baseline during isoproterenol (P < 0.001) and 12 ± 23 msec during epinephrine (P = 0.07), while the longest corrected QT interval (QTc) increase was 67 ± 28 msec (P < 0.0001) and 79 ± 40 msec (P < 0.0001) above baseline during isoproterenol and epinephrine, respectively (P = 0.12 for difference). There was a 2-fold increase in U-wave amplitude during each intervention (P < 0.001). The specificity of paradoxical QT prolongation (≥ 30 msec at 0.05 microg/kg/minute or ≥ 35 msec at 0.10 microg/kg/minute epinephrine) and an increase in QTc ≥ 600 msec at any dose epinephrine were 100%. However, the specificity of other proposed criteria that utilized QTc measurement (≥ 30 msec at 0.10 microg/kg/minute or ≥ 65 msec at any dose) was poor whether all leads or only lead II were assessed.

Conclusion

Both epinephrine and isoproterenol are associated with QTc prolongation and amplification of the U wave in normal subjects. The specificity of proposed criteria for epinephrine provocation in diagnosis of the long-QT syndrome is variable; however, paradoxical QT prolongation at low-dose epinephrine or a QTc ≥ 600 msec is highly specific.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^113DWx7r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful and easily available tool for detection of cardiac disorder in asymptomatic individuals, often preceding symptoms by considerable time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Several studies have linked ECG abnormalities with CV events and prognosis in asymptomatic adults 6, 7, 8, 9 predominantly for major ECG aberrations. 10, 11, 12

Minor ECG abnormalities are common from middle age, 13, 14 and frequently seen in clinical practice in asymptomatic subjects. They are generally regarded as unspecific, not linked to specific myocardial disease. 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 The prognostic value of minor ECG abnormalities is not fully known, but has a potential for preventive considerations. Here, we present a longitudinal population‐based observational cohort study of 50‐year old men, investigating the correlation between a negative T‐wave in resting ECG and mortality during 48 years of follow‐up.

### QT variability index [^112xGE1o]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The QT Variability Index (QTVI) is a non-invasive measure of repolarization lability that has been applied to a wide variety of subjects with cardiovascular disease. It is a ratio of normalized QT variability to normalized heart rate variability, and therefore includes an assessment of autonomic nervous system tone. The approach assesses beat-to-beat variability in the duration of the QT and U wave in conventional surface electrocardiographic recordings, as well as determines the heart rate variability (HRV) from the same recording. As opposed to T wave alternans, QTVI assesses variance in repolarization at all frequencies. Nineteen studies have published data on QTVI in healthy individuals, while 20 have evaluated its performance in cohorts with cardiovascular disease. Six studies have assessed the utility of QTVI in predicting VT/VF, cardiac arrest, or cardiovascular death. A prospective study utilizing QTVI to determine therapy allocation has not been performed, and therefore the final determination of the value of the metric awaits definitive exploration.

### Discordant U waves in the setting of hyperkalaemia [^1148A9Ly]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Physiological U wave genesis occurs likely secondary to either late repolarisation of Purkinje fibres, or late repolarisation of some myocardial cells and/or delayed after depolarisation of the ventricular wall occurring during ventricular filling. Hypokalaemia has a well-known association with pathological 'U wave' which actually combines with the T wave (TU complex) and results from slowing of phase 3 of the action potential with resultant electrical interaction between the three myocardial layers. U waves usually tend to disappear in the setting of hyperkalaemia. We report an unusual case where hyperkalaemia and discordant U waves coexisted. We believe that this may have occurred as a result of partial clinical adaptation of cardiac myocytes to the long-standing effects of hyperkalaemia as the patient had underlying history of chronic kidney disease. We also discuss the possible mechanisms of the U wave genesis and the importance of different U wave morphologies encountered in the real clinical practice.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In controlled clinical trials, 943 adult cancer patients received ANZEMET Tablets. These patients were receiving concurrent chemotherapy, predominantly cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin regimens. The following adverse events were reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving either ANZEMET 25 mg or ANZEMET 100 mg tablets for prevention of cancer chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in controlled clinical trials (Table 3).

In clinical trials, the following reported adverse events, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following oral or intravenous administration of ANZEMET in < 2% of adult patients receiving concomitant cancer chemotherapy:

Cardiovascular: Hypotension; edema, peripheral edema. The following events also occurred and with a similar frequency as placebo and/or active comparator: Mobitz I AV block, chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, myocardial ischemia, syncope, severe bradycardia, and palpitations. See PRECAUTIONS section for information on potential effects on ECG.

In addition, the following asymptomatic treatment-emergent ECG changes were seen at rates less than or equal to those for active or placebo controls: bradycardia, T-wave change, ST-T wave change, sinus arrhythmia, extrasystole (APCs or VPCs), poor R-wave progression, bundle branch block (left and right), nodal arrhythmia, U wave change, atrial flutter/fibrillation.

### Toluene toxicity presenting with hypokalemia, profound weakness and U waves in the electrocardiogram [^112EjCDY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 25-year-old man with progressive limb weakness. His electrocardiogram showed prominent U waves which made us consider hypokalemia. The final diagnosis was toluene intoxication with severe hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Intravenous potassium administration and hydration effectively corrected the electrolyte and acid-base alterations; weakness resolved and the patient was discharged. The approach to a patient with acute weakness can be challenging. This case reminds us that the electrocardiogram can be a valuable tool in the evaluation and differential diagnosis of patients presenting to the emergency department with these conditions.

Ascertainment and quantification of U‐wave integral changes with methadone induction.

A, A 10.6‐second patient ECG record (lead V3) following methadone induction. A threshold algorithm identified R waves (red arrowheads). U waves are evident (green arrows) following each T wave. The mean heart rate in the example was 54 beats per minute, corrected QT with Fridericia formula was 402 ms, and methadone dose was 30 mg/d. B, Nine individual beats aligned at the R wave and averaged to produce a single mean beat. The segment containing the terminal T wave plus U wave is shown (blue) on a 5‐fold expanded vertical scale. Red open symbols indicate the start of the fitted region. C, The T‐ and U‐wave segments (blue) after fitting text Equation 1 to the data (green, superimposed). The resulting contribution of the terminal T wave (green dashed) and U wave (red dashed) comprising the fit are shown. The red shaded region represents the U‐wave integral, 10.8 mV·ms. The residuals of the fit (lower blue record) uniformly span the zero line (white dashed), indicating an excellent fit to the record. The parameter values of the fit of Equation 1 were: A T = 204.2 µV, τ T = 62.0 ms, t P = 90.3 ms, A U = 370.6 µV, τ U = 50.6 ms, and reduced χ 2 of fit 0.069. D, U‐wave integral differences (methadone−baseline) as dot plots for leads V3, V4, V5, and V6. Number of pairs (n) and P value of differences are indicated (paired t test). Dot values > 0 indicate an increase of U‐wave integral after methadone induction. E, Change of U‐wave integrals (methadone−baseline, lead V3) vs methadone dose, showing no correlation with daily dose (Spearman r coefficient and corresponding P value).

For the purposes of QTD calculation, QT interval was measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave (defined as the return to T‐P baseline using the threshold method). When U waves were present, the QT interval was measured as the nadir of the curve between T and U waves. QTD was defined as the difference between the longest and the shortest manual raw QT measurement on a 12‐lead ECG according to the optimal technique described by Malik and colleagues. 13 To ensure validity of QTD measurements, a random sampling of a subset of ECGs underwent independent interpretation by a second cardiologist; interrater reliability for the QTD cut point (QTD ≥ 35 ms) was assessed on 10 randomly chosen ECGs by 2 independent cardiologists with perfect agreement (k = 1.0).

Statistical Analysis

Diagnostic test characteristics (ie, sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for previously derived ECG factors (ectopy, QT prolongation, nonsinus rhythm, and ischemia/infarction). ECG factors were evaluated for prediction of ACVE with χ 2, t test, odds ratios (OR), and 95% CI. OR of ACVE for dichotomized ECG measures were estimated as measures of effect, and adjusted OR for ECG variables were calculated using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, and prior coronary disease.

Receiver operating characteristics curves were plotted for QTc and QTD measurements, with optimal cut points chosen that maximized the sum of sensitivity plus specificity. In addition, because ECG evidence of ischemia/infarction may be felt to have a different interpretation in the setting of drug overdose (ie, different clinical picture than patients with chest pain), we assessed whether ECG evidence of ischemia/infarction could predict overdose‐related adverse events (ACVE, as well as myocardial injury alone, as defined in Table 1).

In order to determine the number of ECGs needed for cardiologist analysis, the study sample size was calculated a priori. We assumed 10% prevalence of ECG predictor variables, as well as baseline 8% ACVE rate in the population based on prior literature. 3 A clinically meaningful increase in risk was deemed to be a 3‐fold increase in odds of ACVE for a given ECG factor. Using these assumptions, we calculated the need to enroll 552 patients with 80% power and 5% alpha.

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^111xGNEZ]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of LQTS relies on the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) and on a number of other electrocardiographic parameters as well as elements obtained by history taking (eg, symptoms and family history). Together they form the LQTS probability or Schwartz score, where a score of ≥ 3.5 points indicates a high probability of LQTS (figures 1 and 2). Genetic information is not part of the Schwartz score but an individual with a pathogenic variant also fulfills the current diagnostic criteria for LQTS. It is important to realise that the QTc of individuals with pathogenic variants and normal healthy controls significantly overlap, indicating that a single QTc will never be able to distinguish all non-LQTS ECGs from all LQTS ECGs. It is also important to realise that there are different methods to measure the QT interval, which need different cut-off values, and that the formulas for heart rate correction are imperfect and also result in different cut-off values. In addition, although the U-wave can also be abnormal in LQTS patients, the U-wave should not be included in the QT assessment. Based on ECGs of a large number of genotyped LQTS patients and their family members not carrying the familial variant, we designed an online calculator with information on the likelihood that LQTS is present based on the calculated QTc. In the past years, additional tools to more reliably assess LQTS on the ECG have been developed, including the use of artificial intelligence in establishing the diagnosis.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT dispersion — defined as the difference between the longest and shortest QT intervals on the electrocardiogram (ECG) — has led to the expectation that it measures regional or localized heterogeneity of myocardial repolarization, but substantial methodological problems have raised fundamental questions about its validity; until adequately validated data are presented, it seems unwise to include it in routine ECG reports, and it is recommended that QT dispersion not be included in routine ECG reports while continued research into body‑surface markers of increased dispersion is encouraged.

### Type-I paradox of Brugada syndrome [^114yHkoP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients Presenting With Cardiac Arrest and a Spontaneous Type‐I ECG

Half of all Brugada syndrome patients presenting with cardiac arrest will not develop recurrent arrhythmias even after 10 years of follow‐up. 5 One could therefore wonder if the absence of ventricular arrhythmias during a SCB test, using Ueoka's protocol, 6 could help select patients who do not need implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. The answer is clearly negative; it is clear from Ueoka's data that the risk is prohibitively high even in the absence of drug‐induced arrhythmias. 6

This report describes an example of a patient with chest pain and classic electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) territory. This electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality is known as Wellens' syndrome. However, the same abnormality is also described as inverted U-waves. The significance of this abnormality and the controversy of describing this syndrome is reviewed and discussed.

### Electromechanical coupling in patients with the short QT syndrome: further insights into the mechanoelectrical hypothesis of the U wave [^113fGSC4]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a short QT syndrome (SQTS) are at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). It is not known whether abbreviation of cardiac repolarization alters mechanical function in SQTS. Controversies persist regarding whether the U wave is a purely electrical or mechanoelectrical phenomenon.

Objective

The present study uses echocardiographic measurements to discriminate between the hypotheses for the origin of the U wave.

Methods

Diagnostic work-up including echocardiography and electrocardiogram was performed in 5 SQTS patients (39 ± 19 years old) from 2 unrelated families with a history of SCD and 5 age-matched and gender-matched control subjects.

Results

QT intervals were 268 ± 18 ms (QTc 285 ± 28 ms) in SQTS versus 386 ± 20 ms (QTc 420 ± 22 ms) in control subjects (P < .005). In SQTS patients, the end of the T wave preceded aortic valve closure by 111 ± 30 ms versus -12 ± 11 ms in control subjects (P < .005). The interval from aortic valve closure to the beginning of the U wave was 8 ± 4 ms in patients and 15 ± 11 ms in control subjects (P = 0.25). Thus, the inscription of the U wave in SQTS patients coincided with aortic valve closure and isovolumic relaxation, supporting the hypothesis that the U wave is related to mechanical stretch.

Conclusion

Our data show for the first time a significant dissociation between the ventricular repolarization and the end of mechanical systole in SQTS patients. Coincidence of the U wave with termination of mechanical systole provides support for the mechanoelectrical hypothesis for the origin of the U wave.

Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

This statement examines the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.

### Cardiac phenotype in-related syndromes: a multicenter cohort study [^112WR5Hf]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac investigations

Original cardiac investigations were anonymized, scanned, collected, and reviewed centrally by 2 independent cardiologists with expertise in genetic cardiac disease and sudden cardiac death (R. A.G-R, J.P.K.). Abnormal repolarization was defined by the presence of abnormal T-wave morphology (flattened or biphasic T waves; bifid or notched T waves) or T-wave inversion in 2 or more of the following leads: I, aVL, and V 4 through V 6 (lateral repolarization abnormalities); II, III, and aVF (inferior repolarization abnormalities); and V 1 through V 3 in patients ≥ 14 years of age (anterior repolarization abnormalities); repolarization abnormalities of this type are seen in 2% of healthy adults. Widespread repolarization abnormalities were defined by abnormalities present in > 1 group of leads. The QTc interval was calculated from lead II with the Bazett formula; its normal range is 360 to 460 milliseconds. The Brugada pattern is characterized by a coved-type ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm followed by a negative T wave in ≥ 1 of the right precordial leads V 1 to V 2. Early repolarization (ER) was defined as a deflection in the R-wave descent (slurred pattern) or a positive deflection with a secondary r′' wave (notching pattern) in the terminal part of the QRS complex in at least 2 of the following leads: I, avL, and V 4 through V 6 (lateral ER) or II, III, and avF (inferior ER). Lateral ER is seen in 3.5% of healthy individuals, and inferior ER appears in 2.4%. The U wave is defined as a small upward deflection following the T wave. It is discernible in ≈25% of the healthy population when the heart rate is within 80 to 95 bpm and is not detectable when the heart rate is > 95 bpm. Right bundle-branch block, complete (RBBB) and incomplete (IRBBB), and intraventricular conduction delays (IVCDs) were defined according to established criteria. Isolated IVCD was considered normal in the absence of additional ECG abnormalities because it is seen in up to 5% of the normal population. Isolated RBBB is seen in 2% to 4% of healthy individuals.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Right atrial abnormality — Right atrial abnormality is typically manifested as an increase in amplitude of the P wave and a tendency to rightward shift of the P-wave vector; a tall upright P wave in lead II (greater than 2.5 mm) is characteristic, and prominent initial positivity of the P wave in V1 or V2 (≥ 1.5 mm [0.15 mV] or more) also indicates right atrial abnormality. Rightward axis of the P wave and a peaked form without increased amplitude are supportive signs. Total P-wave duration is usually normal, but an exception occurs in patients with surgically repaired congenital heart disease (especially those with single-ventricle physiology) where significant P-wave prolongation occurs and is a risk factor for the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Ambulatory electrocardiogram (AECG) QT-RR and repolarization variability assessment — Analysis of the QT-RR relationship requires recordings at different heart rates, making 24-h Holter monitoring recordings suitable, and the QTV Index measures repolarization lability by calculating the ratio of repolarization variability to heart rate variability. Specifically, it assesses beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval and U wave with circadian rate-adjusted QTV and RR interval variability, and increased QTV index is associated with both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction or heart failure and in resuscitated cardiac arrest patients. Recent ESC guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias and SCD do not recommend noninvasive risk stratification in the early postinfarction phase.

### A subtle ECG… [^112MNKKK]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Question. Discussion The answer is A: hypokalemia. Although subtle, this electrocardiogram demonstrates a flattening of the T waves with development of U waves. associated with hypokalemia. The ECG patterns seen in patients with hypokalemia range from slight T-wave flattening alone to the appearance of prominent U waves, occasionally with ST depressions or T-wave inversions. This is usually a progressive pattern. When the U wave is greater than the T wave, the potassium level is usually less than 2. 7 mEq per L. The most common causes of hypokalemia are medications or renal loss related to metabolic alkalosis or potassium loss in the stool secondary to diarrhea.

1 Hypokalemia, although tolerated well in most patients, can be life-threatening in those with underlying cardiac disease. The potassium level in this patient was 2. 3 mEq per L. Treatment includes potassium replacement and correction of the underlying cause when possible. Some patients require daily potassium supplementation. Interestingly, the hypokalemia occurring in this patient was a result of Bartter's syndrome, a rare hereditary disorder of renal potassium wasting secondary to impaired electrolyte transport in the ascending loop of Henle. 2 It is treated mainly by liberal potassium supplementation. The use of spironolactone can also help prevent potassium wasting. As for the remaining multiple-choice answers, hypocalcemia manifests itself on ECG as a prolonged QT interval, which is not present in this tracing. There are no ST elevations or other changes suggestive of acute myocardial infarction in this tracing.

First-degree atrioventricular block should also be ruled out because the PR interval on the ECG shown here is less than 0. 20 mm. Finally, Wollf-Parkinson-White syndrome is a preexcitation syndrome characterized on ECG by wide QRS complexes, short PR intervals and delta waves, none of which are present on the ECG shown here.

### Defining unrecognized myocardial infarction: a call for standardized electrocardiographic diagnostic criteria [^1172yToD]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Unrecognized myocardial infarctions (UMI) are detected by surveillance electrocardiograms (ECGs). In epidemiologic studies, different sets of ECG criteria have been used to define myocardial infarction, possibly contributing to significant differences in prevalence estimates and risk factor associations. We sought to summarize the rationale behind the various UMI-ECG definitions and to suggest an approach to develop uniform criteria.

Methods

A comprehensive review of relevant publications from 1966 to 2002 was conducted.

Results

Out of 14 major studies, the occurrence of UMI as a proportion of all infarctions varied from 4% to 44%, with markedly varying ECG criteria. No study directly addressed the rationale behind selection of ECG criteria. Computerized ECG analysis appears superior to visual reading due to better reliability, speed and cost while maintaining a similar predictive validity. Criteria requiring only major Q waves have the highest specificity for ECG-MI and for prediction validity for future coronary heart disease in middle-aged white men. The addition of minor Q waves and ST-T abnormalities improves predictive validity in middle-aged women and elderly men. Minor Q waves can have their diagnostic accuracy improved by several strategies, including use of ST-T wave changes, Washington Code, vector cardiogram, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-ECG criteria, and serial ECG analysis.

Conclusion

Currently the most cost-effective and valid method for detecting UMI in epidemiologic studies appears to be computerized ECG analysis using major Q waves in middle-aged white men. Issues needing further research include morphologic validation of ECG-UMI criteria and the influence of age, sex, and race on ECG-MI criteria.

### A novel surface electrocardiogram-based marker of ventricular arrhythmia risk in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [^1135cEUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
Technique for measurement of diastolic interval surrogate: T peak to QRS onset (TpQ) and APD surrogate: QRS onset to T peak (QTp). A. When an S2 arrives after the T peak the TpQ and QTp are measured as shown on the left of the diagram. B. If the S2 occurs before the T peak the TpQ is effectively negative. In this case it is measured by subtracting the QTp -1 interval (QTp for the last drive cycle beat) from the QQ, in the example above this would give a TpQ close to zero.

The focus of the study was on regional electrical heterogeneity assessed by APD restitution gradient. For each lead of the surface ECG, the QTp was plotted as a function of TpQ, and gradients were fitted by using 40-ms overlapping least-squares linear segments as described previously by Taggart et al(Figure 2). For each lead, in each 40-ms segment, the difference of the gradient from the mean gradient in that 40-ms segment was calculated. The standard deviation of these values was taken as a measure of APD heterogeneity in each lead. The mean of this was then taken as the R2I2 (no units). A small number of nonphysiologically steep gradients result from points that have near or identical TpQ (measured to the nearest millisecond). To avoid skewing of the data, gradients exceeding ± 10 were censored (1.5% of gradients).

Measurement of T peak -to-T end Interval and QT Dispersion

The exported ECGs also were used to measure nonpaced T peak -to-T end (TpTe) intervals and QT dispersion. As described by Panikkath et al, TpTe was measured in lead V 5, or if V 5 was not suitable because of noise or low amplitude, V 4 or V 6 was used (in that order). T end was taken to be the intersection of the tangent to the down slope of the T wave and the isoelectric line. If a U wave followed the T wave, the T-wave offset was measured as the nadir between the T and U waves. The QT interval was measured from the earliest onset of the QRS complex to the T end. The QT dispersion for each ECG recording was defined as the difference between the longest and shortest measured QT interval.

### Prevalence and prognostic significance of negative U-waves in a 12-lead electrocardiogram in the general population [^111bkSsW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Negative U-waves are a relatively rare finding in an electrocardiogram (ECG), but are often associated with cardiac disease. The prognostic significance of negative U-waves in the general population is unknown. We evaluated 12-lead ECGs of 6,518 adults (45% male, mean age 50.9 ± 13.8 years) for the presence of U-waves, and followed the subjects for 24.5 ± 10.3 years. Primary end points were all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and sudden cardiac death; secondary end point was hospitalization due to cardiac causes. Negative U-waves (amplitude ≥ 0.05 mV) were present in 231 subjects (3.5%), minor negative (amplitude < 0.05 mV) or discordant U-waves in 1,004 subjects (15.4%), normal positive U-waves in 3,950 (60.6%) subjects, and no U-waves were observed in 603 subjects (9.3%). In 730 subjects (11.2%), U-waves were unassessable. When adjusted for age and gender, negative U-waves were associated with all end points (p < 0.01). In an analysis adjusted for multiple demographic and clinical factors, in men, negative U-waves were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 2.03; p < 0.001), cardiac mortality (HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.39; p = 0.001), and cardiac hospitalization (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.18; p < 0.001), but not with sudden cardiac death, whereas women did not show a significant association to any of the end points (p > 0.30). In conclusion, negative U-waves are associated with adverse events in the general population. In men, this association is independent of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Computer-simulated alternative modes of U-wave genesis [^111RCaJZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Several hypotheses for the origin of the U wave in electrocardiograms have been proposed. We have set out to explore and test alternative modes for U-wave genesis via computer simulations.

Methods and Results

A spatial model of a left ventricle has been constructed from 12 layers composed of cubic cells. Each cell is assigned its own time-dependent action potential with its own contribution to the electrical potential at arbitrary points where ECGs are measured. Simulated ECGs show that U waves can be generated using various combinations of action potentials (APs) across the different layers of the ventricular wall. We demonstrate a new mode of U-wave genesis, even with small differences in the repolarization.

Conclusion

The U wave can be generated in the presence of strong intercellular coupling. Myocardial layers with prolonged action potentials, like M cells, are not necessarily needed for U-wave genesis.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^111P28mF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

U‐wave integrals (∫U wave) from all limb and precordial leads were larger following methadone induction. ∫U wave increased distinctly following methadone treatment (lead V3) in 68% of patients with a heart rate < 85 beats per minute (28/41); the net increase in ∫U wave compared with premethadone measures averaged 38% ± 15% (P = 0.016). The mean difference in the ∫U wave magnitude (methadone−baseline) was significantly increased after methadone induction in precordial leads V3 to V6 (Figure 5D). However, the change in ∫U wave did not show an apparent dose dependence (Figure 5E).

### Ventricular repolarization components on the electrocardiogram: cellular basis and clinical significance [^116txq5n]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Ventricular repolarization components on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) include J (Osborn) waves, ST-segments, and T- and U-waves, which dynamically change in morphology under various pathophysiologic conditions and play an important role in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Our primary objective in this review is to identify the ionic and cellular basis for ventricular repolarization components on the body surface ECG under normal and pathologic conditions, including a discussion of their clinical significance. A specific attempt to combine typical clinical ECG tracings with transmembrane electrical recordings is made to illustrate their logical linkage. A transmural voltage gradient during initial ventricular repolarization, which results from the presence of a prominent transient outward K(+) current (I(to))-mediated action potential (AP) notch in the epicardium, but not endocardium, manifests as a J-wave on the ECG. The J-wave is associated with the early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome. ST-segment elevation, as seen in Brugada syndrome and acute myocardial ischemia, cannot be fully explained by using the classic concept of an "injury current" that flows from injured to uninjured myocardium. Rather, ST-segment elevation may be largely secondary to a loss of the AP dome in the epicardium, but not endocardium. The T-wave is a symbol of transmural dispersion of repolarization. The R-on-T phenomenon (an extrasystole originating on the T-wave of a preceding ventricular beat) is probably due to transmural propagation of phase 2 re-entry or phase 2 early after depolarization that could potentially initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^1123qYaP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Methadone is associated with a disproportionate risk of sudden death and ventricular tachyarrhythmia despite only modest inhibition of delayed rectifier K + current (I Kr), the principal mechanism of drug-associated arrhythmia. Congenital defects of inward rectifier K + current (I K1) have been linked to increased U-wave amplitude on ECG and fatal arrhythmia. We hypothesized that methadone may also be a potent inhibitor of I K1, contributing to delayed repolarization and manifesting on surface ECGs as augmented U-wave integrals. Methods and Results Using a whole-cell voltage clamp, methadone inhibited both recombinant and native I K1 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50) of 1.5 μmol/L, similar to that observed for I Kr block (half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.9 μmol/L). Methadone modestly increased the action potential duration at 90% repolarization and slowed terminal repolarization at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, action potential duration at 90% repolarization lengthening was abolished, but its effect on terminal repolarization rose steadily and correlated with increased fluctuations of diastolic membrane potential. In parallel, patient ECGs were analyzed before and after methadone initiation, with 68% of patients having a markedly increased U-wave integral compared with premethadone (lead V3; mean +38% ± 15%, P = 0.016), along with increased QT and T Peak to T End intervals, likely reflective of I Kr block. Conclusions Methadone is a potent I K1 inhibitor that causes augmentation of U waves on surface ECG. We propose that increased membrane instability resulting from I K1 block may better explain methadone's arrhythmia risk beyond I Kr inhibition alone. Drug-induced augmentation of U waves may represent evidence of blockade of multiple repolarizing ion channels, and evaluation of the effect of that agent on I K1 may be warranted.

### Arrhythmogenesis and prolonged repolarization from synthetic opioids: finally sorted? [^116QovXb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Or would it? How would loss of I K1 manifest arrhythmia? And what type (if any) of triggered activity would be expected with loss of I K1? This question is one that my laboratory and others have undertaken; see Reilly and Eckhardt for review. Because of the lack of a specific I K1 blocker, to isolate the effect of I K1 loss, we have generated several KCNJ2 (encodes Kir2.1) KI murine models. These mice are modeled from specific patients with Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome who all have typical ECG features with U waves, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT), and bidirectional VT (some with arrhythmia only under adrenergic stress). In a KCNJ2 KI mouse designed from a patient with adrenergic arrhythmic trigger, we have demonstrated adrenergic dependent loss of I K1. We anticipated finding DADs, the mechanism thought to trigger bidirectional VT, yet these membrane oscillations were relatively slow, infrequent, and rarely reached threshold to trigger a subsequent AP. Moreover, AP analysis and pacing maneuvers with and without adrenergic stimulation also did not induce phase 2 EADs. Instead, we found that the loss of terminal (phase 3) repolarization of the AP resulted in spontaneous phase 3 EADs, present in only the mice heterozygous for the KCNJ2 mutation, not the wild type littermate controls. The phase 3 EADs have a shorter coupling interval to the preceding AP stimulus and more negative takeoff potential (−40 to −55 mV) than phase 2 EADs. In line with this cellular finding, we also found easily inducible PMVT and ventricular fibrillation using ex vivo optical mapping with a single premature ventricular contraction initiation, not a short‐long‐short pattern anticipated for torsade de pointes in long‐QT syndrome.

### Automated and interpretable patient ECG profiles for disease detection, tracking, and discovery [^117TU7vR]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

Although U-Nets can provide accurate segmentation of objects, they fail to take advantage of the obligate ordering of elements in a typical ECG. We thus trained a hidden Markov model (HMM) to accept the output of the U-Net and provide improved segmentation. As a final step, we introduced a simple heuristic filter to eliminate implausibly short ECG complexes (ie, < 10 ms), which was a consistent hallmark of poor HMM performance. The combined CNN-HMM–heuristic filter pipeline was run on all ECGs. ECG segmentation was validated by comparison to manual segmentation and by comparison against measurements a total of 141 864 measurements derived from the GE muse software for 35 466 ECGs (Note II in the). These ECGs were primarily selected for the various classification and estimation tasks related to cardiac structure, function, and disease detection described below and so thus may be biased towards more challenging cases.

Deriving Patient-Level ECG Profiles

Because ECG waveforms and intervals have corollaries to electrical and structural cardiac physiology, a crucial principle to our approach aimed to create a representation of the raw ECG data which preserves these features while still decreasing the feature space, making it tractable for analysis by interpretable machine learning algorithms. To achieve this, we developed a 725-component ECG vector representation derived from segments of the CNN/HMM-segmented ECG. For 3 ECG segments — the PR interval, the QRS complex, and the ST-T-wave complex (including both the ST segment and the T wave) — the vector of raw-voltage amplitude from each of the 12 leads was resized to 20 samples by linear interpolation, averaged across all cardiac cycles, and included as ECG vector components (totaling 720 components). The PR interval, P wave duration, QRS interval, heart rate, and QT intervals were calculated based on the segmentation boundaries and averaged across all cardiac cycles and across 12 leads, and the 5 averaged values were included as 5 additional components in the ECG vector — resulting in a total of 725 components.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^115T32Ch]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

ECG parameters and outlier analysis

The mean changes observed in HR, PR, and QRS durations, as well as QTc duration using all three correction formulae, were not clinically significant. Likewise, no outliers were found for HR, PR, and QRS durations.

An exploratory outlier analysis (e.g. new absolute QTcI > 500 or > 480 or > 450 ms, or a change from baseline of 30–60 or > 60 ms) was performed to look for QTcI changes in the palonosetron groups compared to placebo. No cases of specific outliers (new QTcI > 500-ms change, or > 480 or > 450 ms, or > 60-ms change, or abnormal U waves) were identified at any time point. Only one outlier for QTcI was observed in the 2.25 mg palonosetron dose group. This subject showed a 30–60 ms change from baseline, which was judged to likely be a case of spontaneous variability.

In addition, no differences in the placebo versus palonosetron dose groups for HR, PR, or QRS interval durations were observed. Furthermore, no negative (inverted) T waves or abnormal U waves were observed.

PK-PD relationship with QT variation

A PK/PD relationship between plasma concentrations of palonosetron after IV administration and ECG QT and corrected QT intervals was also explored. There was no statistical or experimental evidence to demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected QT interval or QT intervals with plasma palonosetron concentrations after single-dose administration of IV palonosetron, including supratherapeutic doses up to 2.25 mg which are ninefold greater than the currently marketed 0.25 mg IV dose (Fig. 2).

The synthetic opioid methadone has long been recognized to cause not only QT prolongation on ECG but also a predilection for torsade de pointes. Despite the limited distribution of the drug in comparison to other opioids, methadone use has been inordinately implicated in sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia. However, the full mechanistic scope of why this drug is arrhythmogenic has been unresolved.

It is well known that the majority of drug‐induced long QT and related proarrhythmia is due to inhibition of HERG, which has a promiscuously vulnerable molecular structure, allowing for drugs to directly block the channel or interfere with normal membrane trafficking. At first glance, methadone appears to fall in line with respect to HERG inhibition. Katchman et al. demonstrate HERG blockade with methadone that was significantly more potent than other synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl or morphine). However, on further inspection, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was reported at 10‐fold higher dose than therapeutic free serum concentrations. Other puzzlingly features have been documented including a lack of consistent correlation between dose and QT interval. Moreover, torsade de pointes in methadone users has been shown to correlate low serum K+ levels and U waves. Interestingly, U waves are an ECG feature that correlate with a higher risk of torsade de pointes, particularly when present postextrasystole. These key features are noted to be implicated with loss of I K1, either genetic (Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome) or pharmacologic, rather than solely with HERG inhibition.

### Giant T-U waves precede torsades de pointes in long QT syndrome: a systematic electrocardiographic analysis in patients with acquired and congenital QT prolongation [^116jWiP8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to identify electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria that are associated with initiation of torsades de pointes (TdP) in patients with acquired (a-) and congenital (c-) long QT syndrome (LQTS).

Background

Electrocardiographic criteria used as risk predictors for TdP commonly rely on a prolonged QT interval but rarely consider abnormal T-U waves.

Methods

We analyzed ECG recordings with TdP from 35 LQTS patients (15 c-LQTS and 20 a-LQTS) and compared them with premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) from 40 patients with normal QT intervals and with PVCs in 24 of the 35 LQTS patients not related to TdP.

Results

Abnormal T-U waves (6.2 ± 0.9 mm) directly preceded TdP in 34 of 35 LQTS patients and were larger than T-wave amplitude (2.8 ± 0.2 mm) in control patients and larger than the largest T-U-wave in LQTS without TdP (4.7 ± 0.8 mm). The TdP-initiating beat emerged from a T-U-wave in 27 of 35 LQTS patients and in none of 40 control patients. The QRS duration of the first TdP beat (175 ± 12 ms) was longer than in control PVCs (145 ± 4 ms) and in PVCs in LQTS patients not related to TdP (138 ± 22 ms). The QRS angle was less steep before TdP than in other PVCs (all p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Abnormal, giant T-U waves separate TdP initiation in LQTS patients from PVCs in other heart disease and from other PVCs in LQTS patients. These ECG analyses suggest that early afterdepolarizations initiate TdP and, if present, may help to identify an imminent risk for TdP.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities — coexistence and interpretation — may occur concurrently; ventricular hypertrophy is associated with changes in the shape and duration of the ventricular action potential of isolated ventricular cells, and these changes may contribute to ST- and T-wave changes independent of QRS-amplitude changes and prolongation of the QRS complex. A combination of primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities should also be considered when T-wave polarity does not change as anticipated by the changes in the QRS complex.

### Clinical significance of variants of J-points and J-waves: early repolarization patterns and risk [^115cWGyf]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The variations in the electrocardiographic patterns of J-point elevations, and the complex of J-points and J-waves in early repolarization (ER), in conjunction with disparities in associated sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, have lead to a recognition of the need to carefully classify the spectrum of these observations. Many questions about the pathogenesis of J-wave patterns, and the associated magnitudes of risk, remain unanswered, especially in regard to the risk implications in certain high-prevalence subpopulations such as athletes, children, and adolescents. Interest in these electrocardiography (ECG) patterns has grown dramatically in recent years, in large part because of the frequency with which these patterns are observed on routine ECGs. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the prevalence of different J-point/J-wave patterns and estimates of the magnitude of mortality and SCD risk associated with J-point elevations and J-waves, in what has become known as ER patterns.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

U wave in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation — amplitude, rate dependence, pathologic variants, and reporting: U-wave amplitude has been suggested to be approximately 0.33 mV or 11% of the T wave, and its presence is heart-rate dependent, being rarely present at rates greater than 95 bpm and present in 90% of cases at heart rates less than 65 complexes per minute. Increased U-wave amplitude may occur with quinidine-like cardioactive drugs and hypokalemia; when K is less than 2.7 mmol/L the U-wave amplitude may exceed the T-wave amplitude, although fusion of the U wave with the T wave also occurs with increased sympathetic tone and markedly prolonged QT interval in congenital and acquired long-QT syndromes. An inverted U wave in leads V2 through V3 is abnormal. Recommendation: Statements concerning the U wave should be included in the ECG interpretation when the U wave is inverted, when it is merged with the T wave, or when its amplitude is greater than that of the T wave.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS ST-segment elevation — normal limits and abnormal thresholds in precordial leads: Elevation of the ST segment in leads V1, V2, and V3 should be referenced against normal values, with one reference reporting the upper 98th percentile normal limit as approximately 0.3 mV in white men less than 40 years of age (up to 0.33 mV in the 24- to 29-year age group) and approximately 0.25 mV in white men 40 years old and older, and white women approximately 0.15 mV; another reference lists V2 J-point limits of approximately 0.15 mV in white men and 0.20 mV in black men, with corresponding limits of approximately 0.10 mV for white women and 0.15 mV for black women, and STJ60 limits in V2 of approximately 0.3 mV in white men, approximately 0.35 mV in black men, approximately 0.2 mV in white women, and approximately 0.25 mV in black women; for clinical ischemia/infarction evaluation, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation in V2 and V3 recommended is 0.2 mV for men 40 years of age and older and 0.25 mV for men less than 40 years of age, the recommended threshold for adult women in V2 and V3 is 0.15 mV, and the threshold recommended for men and women in all other standard leads is 0.1 mV; additionally, the ST segment in normal J-point elevation in V2 and particularly V3 is generally sloping slowly upward and normal ST elevation at 60 ms past the J point is combined with an upsloping ST segment rather than with the more horizontal ST segment present in myocardial ischemia.

Recommendation — clinical relevance of distinguishing primary from secondary repolarization abnormalities — states that the distinction is clinically relevant because primary abnormalities indicate changes in the repolarization characteristics of ventricular myocytes whereas secondary changes do not.

T-wave abnormalities — giant inversion causes and notching versus U wave are described: giant T-wave inversion is usually limited to entities including hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, non–ST-segment elevated myocardial infarctions, and neurological events, particularly intracranial hemorrhage; for minor T-wave abnormalities, classification as slight or indeterminate T-wave abnormality is appropriate; the T wave is rarely notched in all 12 leads and the interval between the 2 summits of a notched T wave is usually less than the interval between the peak of a monophasic T wave and the U wave, which usually exceeds 150 ms at heart rates of 50 to 100 bpm.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^1171FMLW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2002, methadone was found to be a moderate inhibitor of the hERG channel responsible for outward rectifier K + current (I Kr), the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, with a half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 9.8 μmol/L. However, in an analysis of 5 clinical trials with 284 patients, < 5% of patients manifested peak methadone concentrations exceeding 3 μmol/L. Because of extensive protein binding, free methadone concentrations may be < 1 μmol/L, substantially reducing the anticipated magnitude of I Kr block. There are few data regarding methadone's impact on other ventricular ion channels that contribute to repolarization. In human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK‐293) cells expressing human Na V 1.5 channels, methadone blocked the tonic and phasic components of the sodium current (IC 50 of 11.2 and 5.5 μmol/L, respectively), which would be predicted to shorten action potential (AP) duration (APD) by limiting the inward current and to reduce the impact of hERG inhibition. Current data, therefore, do not explain the observed delayed repolarization and torsade de pointes noted in both methadone case seriesand pharmacovigilance data, which suggest the importance of investigating additional contributory ion channels.

Methadone has been associated with the presence of U waves on 12‐lead ECG, which could reflect effects on terminal repolarization beyond its established actions on earlier, I Kr ‐mediated repolarization. While the genesis of the U wave is debated, recent clinical data suggest a relationship with the magnitude of the principal current of terminal repolarization: the inward rectifier K+ current (I K1). To our knowledge, no prior study has assessed the impact of methadone on I K1 nor quantified U waves before and after drug initiation. Given this background, we investigated electrophysiological mechanisms of delayed terminal repolarization, postulating blockade of both I Kr and I K1 using the whole‐cell patch‐clamp method in isolated ventricular myocytes. We then assessed for corresponding ECG alterations in repolarization consistent with attenuation in I Kr and I K1.

### Electrocardiographic analysis of ectopic atrial activity obscured by ventricular repolarization: P wave isolation using an automatic 62-lead QRST subtraction algorithm [^115YvESe]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial activity on the surface ECG during premature beats and supraventricular arrhythmias frequently is obscured by the superimposed QRST complex of the previous cardiac cycle. This study examines the performance of a newly developed automatic QRST subtraction algorithm to isolate ectopic P waves from the preceding T-U wave.

Methods and Results

The 62-lead ECG recordings were obtained during (1) sinus rhythm and programmed right atrial stimulation in 12 patients (group A); and (2) sinus rhythm and atrial premature beats, atrial tachycardia, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 5 patients (group B). Pacing in group A patients was conducted at a slow drive cycle length to generate an ectopic P wave not obscured by the previous QRST complex and by delivering single premature extrastimuli at progressively shorter coupling intervals to produce an ectopic P wave obscured by the upsloping (early T-U wave), peak (middle T-U wave), and downsloping component of the T-U wave (late T-U wave). All ectopic P waves in group B patients were concealed by the preceding T-U wave. Automatic QRST subtraction was attained using an adaptive template constructed from averaged QRST complexes (mean 83 ± 25 complexes) obtained during sinus rhythm (groups A and B) or atrial overdrive pacing (group A). P wave integral maps subsequently were computed, visually compared, and mathematically correlated. A high correspondence in spatial map pattern was observed between integral maps of "nonobscured" and previously "obscured" paced P waves obtained in group A patients (mean r = 0.88 ± 0.07) as well as between integral maps of two to three previously obscured P waves with the same atrial arrhythmia morphology obtained in group B patients (mean r = 0.94 ± 0.05). Improved morphologic P wave replication in group A patients was acquired when concealment occurred in the early (mean r = 0.90 ± 0.08) or late part of the T-U wave (mean r = 0.90 ± 0.06) as opposed to the middle T-U wave (mean r = 0.85 ± 0.07) (P = NS and P < 0.05 for early vs middle and late vs middle T-U wave, respectively).

Conclusion

This novel automatic 62-lead QRST subtraction algorithm enables discrete isolation of T-U wave obscured ectopic atrial activity on the surface ECG while retaining the intricate spatial detail in P wave morphology. Future clinical application of the algorithm may enable improved ECG localization of focal triggers of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and the atrial insertion of accessory pathways.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^111SvhXr]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) — electrocardiographic onset and behavior in drug‑induced cases usually begin with a short‑long‑short pattern of R‑R cycles initiated by a short‑coupled premature ventricular complex (PVC) followed by a compensatory pause and then another PVC near the peak of the T wave; episodes typically show a warm‑up phenomenon, the TdP rate ranges from 160 to 240 beats per minute, and spontaneous termination often shows slowing in the last 2 to 3 beats. The term is better confined to episodic polymorphic tachycardias with marked (> 500 ms) QT‑interval prolongation and QT‑U deformity, reflecting a distinct mechanistic and therapeutic entity.

### Tapentadol hydrochloride (Nucynta) [^111FSTr2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1	MECHANISM OF ACTION

Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Although the clinical relevance is unclear, preclinical studies have shown that tapentadol is a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI). Analgesia in animal models is derived from both of these properties.

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Tapentadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on the brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Tapentadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Tapentadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid- induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

There was no effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of tapentadol on the QT interval. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study, healthy subjects were administered five consecutive doses of NUCYNTA 100 mg every 6 hours, NUCYNTA 150 mg every 6 hours, placebo and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin. Similarly, NUCYNTA had no relevant effect on other ECG parameters (heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, T-wave or U-wave morphology).

Tapentadol produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

### The negative U wave… [^1142nE2t]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of hypertension, seizure disorder, and polysubstance use was brought to the hospital because of altered mental status. On arrival to the emergency department, she demonstrated nonpurposeful lower extremity movements and was nonresponsive; her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6. Vital signs were notable for normal body temperature, normal heart rate, and markedly elevated blood pressure. Physical examination findings revealed an ill-appearing, normocephalic woman with asymmetric pupils — the left pupil was 4 mm in diameter and her right pupil was described as pinpoint. Stroke was suspected, and she was intubated because of concern for inability to protect the airway. Computed tomography of the head did not demonstrate hemorrhage, herniation, large-vessel occlusion, or perfusion mismatch.

Initial laboratory workup findings were largely unremarkable, with lactate, creatinine, glucose, and high-sensitivity troponin levels all within normal limits. Serum electrolyte levels, including potassium and magnesium, were grossly normal. An electrocardiogram was obtained. Salazar JW, Goldschlager N. The Negative U Wave: The Company U Keep.

ECG Evaluation

Patients with typical and atypical AHC received ECG and 24‐hour Holter monitor evaluation as part of routine care. All ECGs consisted of 12 leads and were recorded using a paper speed of 25 mm/s with an amplitude of 10 mm/mV. For patients with multiple ECGs, the first ECG study was used for all analyses. The parameters evaluated from each ECG were heart rate, PR duration, QRS duration, QT interval, P‐wave axis, QRS‐wave axis, and T‐wave axis. Additionally, the presence of early repolarization and presence of U waves and T‐wave alternans was recorded for each patient. The criteria for ST elevation or depression were the presence of elevation or depression in at least 2 leads that measured at least 0.1 mV. The QTc interval was calculated with Bazett's formula (QTc = QT/√RR)using the manually measured QT interval. The automated QT/QTc calculation was not reported or used in the analysis. The threshold set for shortened QTc interval was < 370 milliseconds established by the Gollob criteria. To ensure reproducibility of QTc measurements, 2 pediatric electrophysiologists independently remeasured QT/QTc intervals blinded to clinical status and genotype. Both electrophysiologists manually remeasured the QT/QTc intervals of each ECG used in the study. Twenty ECGs were randomly selected to compare reproducibility of the measurements. The method for QT determination was based on Lepeschkin and Surawicz. Lead II was the preferential lead for remeasurement of QT/QTc, but if the tracing in lead II could not be used for measurement, lead V5 was used. The QT interval was defined as the beginning of the Q wave to the point where a tangent from the steepest part of the T‐wave downslope crossed the isoelectric baseline. If present, U waves were excluded. This method is demonstrated in Figure S1.

### Integrating deep learning with ECG, heart rate variability and demographic data for improved detection of atrial fibrillation [^1173ipAW]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) presents significant health challenges by increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure and overall morbidity and mortality. Early detection of AF is pivotal in initiating timely interventions. AF detection remains challenging, primarily due to its often asymptomatic nature, transient and intermittent occurrence, and difficulties acquiring and evaluating long ECG recordings. Different studiesestimate that 8%–48% of individuals with AF are asymptomatic, with prevalence varying based on patient population, age, comorbidities and study methodology. Large registry-based studies report lower prevalence (eg, 8.1%), while cardiology cohort studies estimate rates as high as 43%–48%. Epidemiological data further suggest that up to one-third of individuals with AF may not experience symptoms. Given the swift and broad introduction of consumer devices capable of detecting AF, it is pivotal to continue improving machine learning (ML) methods for this purpose.

Theoretically, the clinical approach to diagnosing AF is based primarily on an irregular ventricular rhythm with an absence of P waves. Traditional ML methodsfor AF detection focus on specific features like P wave presence and RR interval (time between two consecutive R-wave peaks in the ECG signal) regularity, involving manual or semiautomated feature extraction followed by rule-based or statistical analysis. However, these traditional methods have significant limitations. They depend on accurately identifying these features and can be affected by noise, missing complex patterns in the data. Recent studies have shown that neural networks can analyse these features, improving on traditional methods. Hybrid models like U-Net and ResNet, as well as DenseNet, have been used to extract key ECG features, enhancing AF classification. Techniques like SHAP with Random Forests have also improved interpretability, while combining P wave analysis with RR interval variability helps reduce false positives. These advancements highlight the potential of deep learning (DL) for automating AF detection and improving clinical reliability.

### Electrocardiographic features in Andersen-Tawil syndrome patients with KCNJ2 mutations: characteristic T-U-wave patterns predict the KCNJ2 genotype [^113aA568]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The ECG features of Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) patients with KCNJ2 mutations (ATS1) have not been systematically assessed. This study aimed to define ECG features of KCNJ2 mutation carriers, to determine whether characteristic T-U-wave patterns exist, and to establish whether T-U patterns predict the ATS1 genotype.

Methods and Results

In phase I, evaluation of T-U morphology in ECGs of 39 KCNJ2 mutation carriers identified characteristic T-U patterns: prolonged terminal T downslope, wide T-U junction, and biphasic and enlarged U waves. In phase II, ATS1 genotype prediction by T-U pattern was evaluated in the next 147 ECGs (57 other KCNJ2 mutation carriers, 61 unaffected family members, and 29 ATS patients without KCNJ2 mutations), with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 97%. Characteristic T-U patterns were present in 91% (87/96), in whom an enlarged U wave was predominant (73%). In phase III, QTc, QUc, and T- and U-wave duration/amplitude were compared in the 96 ATS1, 29 non-KCNJ2 ATS, and 75 normal subjects. In ATS1 patients, QUc, U-wave duration and amplitude, and QTc were all increased (P < 0.001), but median QTc and interquartile range (IQR) were just 440 ms (IQR, 28 ms) compared with 420 ms (IQR, 20 ms) in normal subjects and 425 ms (IQR, 48 ms) in ATS non-KCNJ2 patients.

Conclusions

In ATS1 patients, gene-specific T-U-wave patterns resulting from decreased IK1 owing to KCNJ2 mutations can aid diagnosis and direct genotyping. The normal QTc, distinct ECG, and other clinical features distinguish ATS1 from long-QT syndrome, and it is best designated as ATS1 rather than LQT7.

### Phenotypes of overdiagnosed long QT Syndrome [^113dBztT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) predisposes individuals to arrhythmic syncope or seizure, sudden cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Increased physician and public awareness of LQTS-associated warning signs and an increase in electrocardiographic screening programs may contribute to overdiagnosis of LQTS.

Objectives

This study sought to identify the diagnostic miscues underlying the continued overdiagnosis of LQTS.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for patients who arrived with an outside diagnosis of LQTS but were dismissed as having normal findings subsequently. Data were abstracted for details on referral, clinical history, and both cardiologic and genetic test results.

Results

Overall, 290 of 1,841 (16%) patients with original diagnosis of LQTS (174 [60%] female; mean age at first Mayo Clinic evaluation, 22 ± 14 years; mean QTc interval, 427 ± 25 milliseconds) were dismissed as having normal findings. The main cause of LQTS misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis was a prolonged QTc interval secondary to vasovagal syncope (n = 87; 30%), followed by a seemingly positive genetic test result for a variant in 1 of the main LQTS genes (n = 68; 23%) that was ultimately deemed not to be of clinical significance. Furthermore, patients received misdiagnoses because of a positive family history of SCD that was deemed unrelated to LQTS (n = 46; 16%), isolated/transient QT prolongation (n = 44; 15%), or misinterpretation of the QTc interval as a result of inclusion of the U-wave (n = 40, 14%).

Conclusions

Knowing the 5 main determinants of discordance between a previously rendered diagnosis of LQTS and full diagnostic reversal or removal (vasovagal syncope, "pseudo"-positive genetic test result in LQTS-causative genes, family history of SCD, transient QT prolongation, and misinterpretation of the QTc interval) increases awareness and provides critical guidance to reduce this burden of overdiagnosed LQTS.
