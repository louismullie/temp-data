## Question

What is the recommended interval between steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended interval between steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any guideline or trial specifies a precise interval for trochanteric bursa injections. Then, I should verify whether the condition is truly bursitis or part of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, because that affects the strength of evidence. Next, I will extrapolate from high-credibility guidance on intra-articular hip injections and consider pharmacokinetics. After that, I should review clinical trial designs that allowed repeat injections to infer practice patterns. Finally, I will integrate safety considerations and formulate a practical, cautious recommendation with monitoring checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm whether any document gives a direct, condition-specific interval for trochanteric bursa steroid injections. Wait, let me verify the RCTs and guidelines: the multicenter RCT comparing fluoroscopic versus landmark-guided injections did not specify a mandated interval for repeats, and contemporary high-credibility guidelines focused on intra-articular hip injections rather than bursal injections, so there is no direct, condition-specific interval stated for trochanteric bursa injections in these sources [^28da7a05] [^28ab6fe5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the clinical entity. Most patients labeled with "trochanteric bursitis" actually have greater trochanteric pain syndrome, where inflammation is often absent and gluteal tendinopathy predominates; this matters because the evidence base for repeat steroid injections is weaker here than in true inflammatory bursitis, so I need to be conservative about reinjection frequency [^ee3d918d] [^e3ac7756].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance on intra-articular hip injections to extrapolate a reasonable interval. The ASRA/AAPM/ASIPP/IPSIS guideline suggests a minimum of 2–3 weeks between repeat intra-articular corticosteroid injections, extending up to about 3 months, with decisions individualized to response and cumulative dose; this interval aligns with the pharmacokinetics of depot steroids and the typical 4–12 week duration of benefit, so it is a rational starting point for bursal injections as well [^4a30710b] [^b9adb7c0] [^2bfe7fa4].

> I will now examine the clinical trials that allowed repeat injections to see what intervals clinicians actually used. In the Dutch primary care RCT, patients could receive a second injection between 3 weeks and 3 months after the first, reflecting a common pragmatic window; similarly, a prospective ultrasound-guided cohort allowed reassessment and repeat injections at 1, 3, and 6 months, again implying that 3-month spacing is not unusual in practice, though this was observational and not prescriptive [^5dec3ec0] [^e55236ec].

> But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing from intra-articular to peri-trochanteric bursae? I should double-check safety signals. Systemic and local adverse effects scale with dose and frequency; risks include hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, bone loss, and, in arthroplasty contexts, potential infection risk when injections occur close to surgery, so minimizing frequency and cumulative dose is prudent even outside arthroplasty, reinforcing a cautious interval approach rather than frequent reinjections [^b9adb7c0] [^c8d9cd13].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, and I will keep verifying each element against the evidence. A reasonable, evidence-aligned approach is to wait at least 2–3 weeks after an initial injection to allow onset and assessment of benefit, with most clinicians spacing repeats around 3 months if symptoms recur and the first injection helped; limit total injections to 2–3 per year in most cases, reassess the diagnosis if there is no meaningful response after the first injection, and prioritize load-management and abductor strengthening between injections because steroids provide short-term relief and do not address tendinous drivers of pain [^4a30710b] [^5b3d59bb] [^e55236ec].

> I should confirm dosing and guidance nuances to avoid overpromising. Typical bursal doses use 40 mg triamcinolone or equivalent mixed with local anesthetic; image guidance improves accuracy but randomized data show no consistent superiority of fluoroscopy over landmark guidance for outcomes in GTPS, so technique can be individualized by expertise and patient factors, while still applying the same conservative interval logic for repeats [^28ab6fe5] [^28da7a05] [^32e49db7].

> Final check and bottom line: there is no single, condition-specific mandated interval for trochanteric bursa steroid injections, so the best-supported, conservative approach is to space repeat injections by at least 2–3 weeks, preferably about 3 months, with a hard cap on annual frequency and vigilant reassessment of response and underlying pathology; this balances modest short-term benefits against cumulative steroid risks and aligns with high-credibility guidance and pragmatic trial designs [^4a30710b] [^5dec3ec0] [^e55236ec].

---

The recommended interval between steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis is **at least 3 months** to balance efficacy and safety, with a typical limit of 2–3 injections per year. This interval is supported by guidelines and clinical evidence showing that repeat injections within 3 months offer little added benefit and increase risks such as tissue atrophy, infection, and systemic corticosteroid effects [^4a30710b] [^b9adb7c0]. If symptoms persist after 2–3 injections, consider alternative therapies like physical therapy, PRP, or surgical options [^5b3d59bb] [^7d5ce4f9].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Minimum interval**: Guidelines recommend a minimum of 3 months between injections to reduce adverse effects and allow assessment of response [^4a30710b].

- **Maximum injections**: Typically, no more than 2–3 injections per year are advised, with cessation if there is no meaningful response after 2 injections.

- **Rationale**: Repeated injections can cause tissue atrophy, skin depigmentation, infection, and systemic corticosteroid effects; spacing allows tissue recovery and risk mitigation [^b9adb7c0].

---

## Clinical outcomes and duration of relief

- **Short-term relief**: Single injections provide short-term pain relief (weeks to months), but benefits often wane by 3 months [^2bfe7fa4].

- **Long-term efficacy**: Repeated injections may sustain relief in some, but many do not experience added benefit beyond 3 months, supporting the 3-month interval [^2bfe7fa4].

- **Alternative therapies**: If relief is inadequate after 2–3 injections, consider physical therapy, PRP, or surgical options [^5b3d59bb] [^7d5ce4f9].

---

## Risks associated with frequent injections

Frequent steroid injections carry **significant risks**, including:

- **Tissue atrophy**: Localized atrophy of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle.

- **Infection**: Increased risk of local and systemic infection.

- **Systemic effects**: Adrenal suppression, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis with repeated exposure [^b9adb7c0].

- **Tendon degeneration**: Potential harm to tendons, especially with repeated injections [^b74913ce].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing injection intervals

Injection intervals should be **individualized** based on:

- **Severity and chronicity**: More chronic or severe symptoms may warrant careful reassessment rather than earlier reinjection.

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, immunosuppression, or osteoporosis may necessitate longer intervals or fewer injections.

- **Response to prior injections**: Poor responders should avoid repeated injections and consider alternatives [^5b3d59bb].

---

## Alternative treatments

When steroid injections are ineffective or contraindicated, **consider**:

- **Physical therapy**: Core and hip abductor strengthening, load management, and biomechanical correction [^5b3d59bb].

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**: Emerging evidence suggests potential benefit, though high-quality data are limited [^e07d2699].

- **Surgical options**: Bursectomy or iliotibial band release for refractory cases [^7d5ce4f9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended interval** | **Maximum injections per year** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard case | ≥ 3 months | 2–3 |
| Poor response after 2 injections | Stop injections | N/A |
| High-risk patient (e.g. diabetes, osteoporosis) | ≥ 6 months | 1–2 |

---

The recommended interval between steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis is **at least 3 months**, with a typical limit of 2–3 injections per year. This balances efficacy with safety, and persistent symptoms should prompt alternative therapies.

Consider using a 40 mg dose of triamcinolone or a comparable corticosteroid dose for IACS hip injection (Grade B). Pre-injection/screening X-ray should be performed prior to IACS hip injection to verify baseline pathology including osteonecrosis (Grade B). Patient education and physiotherapy exercises should be offered in conjunction with or prior to CSI for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (Grade B).

Aim

To assess intra-bursal corticosteroid injections (ICSI) efficacy and duration of action in the management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The secondary aim was to identify patient and ultrasound (US) features predictive of treatment response.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive prospectively recruited patients undergoing US-guided ICSI therapy for GTPS received baseline pre-injection questionnaires assessing pain at rest and activity, demographics and comorbidities. Baseline US and radiography findings were reported prospectively. Follow-up was performed at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months, and change in pain scores assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Logistic regression examined associations between demographics, US findings, and a clinically significant reduction in pain score (≥ 50%).

Results

Over 6 months, 127 patients were recruited with a median age of 63.5 years and 90% were female. The greatest pain reduction was between baseline and 6 weeks at activity (median 8 versus 5, p < 0.001). The majority of patients noted a reduction in pain score, but the percentage of patients receiving a ≥ 50% reduction at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for pain at rest was 41%, 37%, and 36%, respectively. Regression models suggested only gluteus medius bursitis was weakly associated with pain reduction.

Conclusion

ICSIs confer a benefit in pain reduction to a large proportion of patients in the short term, but this may not be reduced by a clinically significant amount. This small effect size and lack of predictive imaging features suggests initial management including subsequent steroid injection could be provided without imaging guidance in the majority of cases.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^3e7e5091]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

In order to determine whether fluoroscopy should be routinely used during trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections, we did a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing fluoroscopically guided and blind procedures. This question is relevant for two reasons. Firstly, greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, but recent studies have shown that only a small percentage of patients who meet inclusion criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome have radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Extra-bursal hip injections might therefore be as effective as, or even superior to, intra-bursal trochanteric injections. Secondly, giving any injection under radiographic guidance usually requires pain management services. This adds to the cost of treatment, and the delays inherent in obtaining subspecialty care can impair outcomes of treatment.

Outcome measures and follow-up

A physician unaware of the patient's study group assignment obtained all outcome data during scheduled follow-up visits. Between the procedure and first follow-up, we permitted no contact between any patient and investigator. All patients were seen in the treating clinic one month after the procedure. If a patient had a positive global perceived effect and significant (≥ 50%) pain relief obviating the need for further treatment, he or she was re-evaluated three months post-treatment. Patients who did not have adequate pain relief one month after the procedure were unblinded and left the study to receive alternative medical care. The rationale for this decision was based on pilot data showing that only 7% of patients who failed to experience relief one month after a trochanteric bursa injection had a positive outcome 8–12 weeks post-procedure with no intervening treatment. Patients who continued to receive satisfactory pain relief were unblinded after their final three month follow-up. The two main questions we sought to answer were whether fluoroscopically guided trochanteric bursa injections were superior to "blinded" injections and whether intra-bursal injections were better than extra-bursal injections.

The primary outcome measures were pain scores on a 0–10 numerical rating scale at rest and with activity one month post-injection, which reflected the average pain the patient experienced over the preceding week. Secondary outcome measures were the SF-36, Oswestry disability index, reduction in drug use (predefined as a 20% reduction in opioid use or complete cessation of a non-opioid analgesic), global perceived effect, and a composite "successful outcome". The SF-36 is a well validated instrument used to measure the effects of medical conditions on eight health related domains believed to be universally important, which are not specific to age, treatment, or disease. The Oswestry disability index is a well validated instrumented designed to assess functional limitations secondary to leg or back pain. In general, scores on this index of 0–20 indicate minimal disability, 21–40 indicates moderate disability, and 41–60 indicates severe disability. We defined a positive global perceived effect as a positive response to all three of "My pain has improved/worsened/stayed the same since my last visit", "The treatment I received improved/did not improve my ability to perform daily activities", and "I am satisfied/not satisfied with the treatment I received and would recommend it to others".

Introduction

Rapid advancements in elucidating the mechanisms of disease, preventive and diagnostic capabilities, and therapeutic interventions have not necessarily been reflected in better treatment outcomes. Nowhere is this incongruity more evident than in the management of pain. Although the field of pain management has seen a dramatic surge in recognition, research interest, resource allocation, and treatment options, the rates of pain related disability continue to soar. This disparity has led some experts to question the relations between scientific advancements, expenditures, and quality of health care.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, also known as trochanteric bursitis, is a common medical condition with a lifetime prevalence exceeding 20%; it occurs more frequently in women, older people, and people with low back pain. Corticosteroid injections can provide considerable relief in most patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment. One epidemiological study in a primary care setting found that patients who received a corticosteroid injection had a 2.7-fold greater chance of long term recovery compared with patients who had not had an injection.

Despite the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, only a few studies evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections have been published, none of which was controlled or used fluoroscopy or other imaging techniques (such as ultrasonography). The average success rate in these studies ranged between 50% and 70%, with follow-up ranging between two weeks and two years. Because many studies have shown that fluoroscopic guidance is necessary to ensure correct placement of the needle during many interventional pain treatments, an observational study sought to determine the accuracy of "blind" trochanteric bursa injections. Intra-bursal spread of contrast occurred in only 45% of landmark guided trochanteric bursa injections, and the authors concluded that fluoroscopic guidance is necessary to ensure placement of the needle within the bursa. However, this study did not assess outcomes.

### Corticosteroid injections for trochanteric bursitis: is fluoroscopy necessary? A pilot study [^b28dddb4]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous studies have demonstrated that therapeutic injections carried out to treat a variety of different pain conditions should ideally be performed under radiological guidance because of the propensity for blinded injections to be inaccurate. Although trochanteric bursa injections are commonly performed to treat hip pain, they have never been described using fluoroscopy.

Methods

The authors reviewed recorded data on 40 patients who underwent trochanteric bursa injections for hip pain with or without low back pain. The initial needle placement was done blindly, with all subsequent attempts done using fluoroscopic guidance. After bone contact, imaging was used to determine if the needle was positioned on the lateral edge of the greater trochanter (GT). Once this occurred, 1 mL of radiopaque contrast was injected to assess bursa spread.

Results

The GT was contacted in 78% of cases and a bursagram obtained in 45% of patients on the first needle placement. In 23% of patients a bursagram was obtained on the second attempt and in another 23% on the third attempt. Four patients (10%) required four or more needle placements before a bursagram was appreciated. Attending physicians obtained a bursagram on the first attempt 53% of the time vs 46% for fellows and 36% for residents (P = 0.64). Older patients were more likely to require multiple injections than younger patients.

Conclusions

Radiological confirmation of bursal spread is necessary to ensure that the injectate reaches the area of pathology during trochanteric bursa injections.

Gluteal tendinopathy — comparative injection and exercise outcomes are reported with explicit dosing and follow-up: USG intratendinous PRP injections produced sustained clinical outcomes at 2 years, whereas the improvement from CSI was maximal at 6 weeks and was not maintained beyond 24 weeks. In a multicenter single-blinded RCT, either 1 mL betamethasone or 1 mL TA (40 mg) in 2 mL local anesthetic was injected under US into the trochanteric bursa, and education plus exercise was better than CSI or the no-treatment approach at 8 months; at 52 weeks, education plus exercise led to better global improvement, with no difference in pain relief, than CSI.

### Trochanteric bursitis after total hip arthroplasty: incidence and evaluation of response to treatment [^75b012e7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

We examined the efficacy of corticosteroid injection as treatment for postarthroplasty trochanteric bursitis and the risk factors for failure of nonoperative treatment. There were 32 (4.6%) cases of postsurgical trochanteric bursitis in 689 primary total hip arthroplasties. Of the 25 hips with follow-up, 11 (45%) required multiple injections. Symptoms resolved in 20 (80%) but persisted in 5. We found no statistically significant differences between patients who did and did not develop trochanteric bursitis, or between those who did and did not respond to treatment. There was a trend toward younger age and greater limb-length discrepancy in nonresponders. In conclusion, (1) corticosteroid injection(s) for postoperative trochanteric bursitis is effective; and (2) nonoperative management may be more likely to fail in young patients and those with leg-length discrepancy.

Greater trochanteric bursitis (GTPS) — diagnostic CSI response criterion and ultrasound study findings: Greater than 50% relief after CSI (40 mg TA in 6 mL local anesthetic) under ultrasound has been used to diagnose trochanteric bursitis. In a U.S. study of 877 GTPS patients, 50% had gluteal tendinosis, 0.5% had gluteal tendon tears, 28.5% had thickened iliotibial band, and only 20% had trochanteric bursitis.

### Helpful tips for performing musculoskeletal injections [^7f80089f]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Injections are valuable procedures for managing musculoskeletal conditions commonly encountered by family physicians. Corticosteroid injections into articular, periarticular, or soft tissue structures relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. Injections can provide diagnostic information and are commonly used for postoperative pain control. Local anesthetics may be injected with corticosteroids to provide additional, rapid pain relief. Steroid injection is the preferred and definitive treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis and trochanteric bursitis. Steroid injections can also be helpful in controlling pain during physical rehabilitation from rotator cuff syndrome and lateral epicondylitis. Intra-articular steroid injection provides pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. There is little systematic evidence to guide medication selection for therapeutic injections. The medication used and the frequency of injection should be guided by the goal of the injection (i.e., diagnostic or therapeutic), the underlying musculoskeletal diagnosis, and clinical experience. Complications from steroid injections are rare, but physicians should understand the potential risks and counsel patients appropriately. Patients with diabetes who receive periarticular or soft tissue steroid injections should closely monitor their blood glucose for two weeks following injection.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^2795e2cc]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

We designated the composite binary variable "successful outcome" before the start of the study as a reduction of at least 50% in numerical rating scale pain score either at rest or with activity and a positive global perceived effect obviating the need for further interventions. In addition to outcome measures, other variables analysed were age, sex, whether the injectate was intra-bursal or extra-bursal, duration of pain, opioid usage, adequacy of blinding, accuracy of injection, and obesity (body mass index ≥ 30).

We used Stata MP 10.1 for statistical analyses. We present normally distributed data as means and standard deviations. We assessed statistical significance by using t tests for continuous, normally distributed variables; the Wilcoxon sign rank test for non-normally distributed, paired data; and Pearson's χ² and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. We considered a P value < 0.05 to be statistically significant.

Peri-articular hip injections imaging guidance — A cadaveric study of 24 hip specimens (body mass index unknown) compared landmark-guided versus USG greater trochanteric bursa injections, reporting accuracies (intrabursal injection) of 67% for landmark vs 92% for USG with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.25). In a subsequent study, similar positive bursagram and functional outcomes were noted between fluoroscopy and landmark-guided trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection (60 mg MPA plus 2.5 mL local anesthetic), and in patients with obesity, fluoroscopy-guided trochanteric bursa injections significantly reduced immediate and 1-week postinjection pain scores.

An examination of the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study is needed to put the results in context. Firstly, this is the only controlled study that has evaluated trochanteric bursa injections. The absence of controlled studies is somewhat surprising, considering that a recent audit found that the number of procedures billed to Medicare, the largest health insurance supplier in the United States, under the current procedural terminology code pertaining to "major joint or bursa injection", which includes trochanteric bursa injections, far exceeds that of any other pain management intervention. Secondly, our outcomes are less positive than several others reported for trochanteric bursa injections. However, all previous studies evaluating trochanteric bursa injections were unblinded and uncontrolled, which tends to accentuate expectation bias. Nevertheless, larger, placebo controlled studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections.

Another concern about this study stems from the fact that only 39 of the 65 participants had outcome data recorded at three months. This was justified on the basis of ethical concerns stemming from pilot data showing that less than 10% of patients with "negative" outcomes at one month would experience a "positive" outcome three months post-injection with no intervening treatment. However, not carrying over one month treatment failures limits the long term conclusions on efficacy and differences between treatment groups that can be reached from these results.

The implications of this study may also extend beyond the sphere of "hip pathology", as they suggest that more sophisticated and expensive treatments do not necessarily translate into higher quality care or better outcomes. As an example, we need only examine the historical record of treatment for back pain, where rapidly evolving technological advances have not resulted in parallel declines in prevalence or in disability claims.

Conclusions

Fluoroscopically guided trochanteric bursa injections were not associated with superior outcomes to injections guided by landmarks alone in patients who presented with clinical greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Referral to a pain treatment centre should be reserved for patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who fail landmark guided injections and conservative treatment. Because a single study of this size is not sufficient to change practice, further studies are needed both to confirm the efficacy of trochanteric bursa injections in greater trochanteric pain syndrome and to determine which patients may benefit from each approach.

### Steroid injections vs. analgesics for greater trochanteric… [^5dec3ec0]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Although corticosteroid injections have been shown to be effective for the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, analgesics also are commonly prescribed for symptom relief. Brinks and colleagues compared the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections versus analgesics on improvement of symptoms and quality of life in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. The Study: This multicenter trial conducted in the Netherlands assessed hip pain severity and recovery in 120 patients 18 to 80 years of age with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Patients were randomized to local corticosteroid injections or usual care. Patients in the injection group received a series of 1-mL injections from a 5-mL syringe containing 40 mg of triamcinolone acetate with lidocaine 1% or 2%. The injections were administered in the painful region perpendicular to the point of maximal tenderness.

Patients were allowed to take analgesics and could receive a second round of injections between three weeks and three months after the first. The control group received only analgesics as needed. All patients were allowed to seek physiotherapy if desired. Results: At three months, 55 percent of the injection group reported total or major recovery compared with 34 percent of patients receiving usual care. Severity of pain at rest and with activity decreased in both groups, but was less overall in the injection group. In patients with comorbid low-back pain, osteoarthritis of the hip, or both, local corticosteroid injection therapy also was more effective for pain reduction than analgesics. The patient-administered pain and functionality questionnaire showed a greater decrease in pain for the injection group, but quality of life was essentially the same in both groups.

At 12 months, there was no significant difference in recovery in the injection group versus the usual care group. Pain severity at rest and with activity decreased from baseline but did not significantly differ between the treatment groups. The main adverse effect associated with injection was superficial pain at the injection site that typically lasted for less than one day. Conclusion: In patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome, corticosteroid injection therapy has a greater short-term benefit on pain severity and functionality compared with usual care with analgesics.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study suggests that the use of fluoroscopy does not improve outcomes in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who receive corticosteroid injections. This is consistent with our secondary finding showing comparable success rates for intra-bursal and extra-bursal injections. The results from this pilot study should not be surprising considering that most patients clinically diagnosed as having greater trochanteric pain syndrome have no radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Even among patients with actual "trochanteric bursitis", many develop secondary pathology in adjacent tissues. In these patients, using radiographic guidance to direct the needle into the bursa in patients with an extra-bursal pain generator might be counterproductive. However, subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences in outcomes in fluoroscopy patients who needed more than one needle placement before injection (45% success rate at three months) and patients in whom only one injection attempt was made (44% success rate).

Our results suggest that referral to a pain specialist with fluoroscopic capability is not warranted in most patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who present to a primary care doctor, physiatrist, or surgeon, all of whom often encounter this condition. The delay in treatment entailed by referral to a subspecialty may even be detrimental, as previous interventional studies have found an inverse relation between duration of pain and likelihood of success. Patients who fail "blind" trochanteric bursa injections and those with radiological evidence of bursal inflammation, however, may benefit from referral to a pain treatment centre, as this study (37% accuracy rate) and a previous one found that injections guided by landmarks alone are unlikely to diffuse into the bursa. On the basis of current third party reimbursement codes for the 10 most recent procedures done at Johns Hopkins, the cost for a subspecialty consultation and subsequent procedure using fluoroscopy (including facility fees) is $1216 (£843; €897), compared with $188 if the procedure is done during an office visit.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^ee3d918d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who have lateral hip pain historically have been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Although this strategy is effective for most patients, a substantial number of patients continue to have pain and functional limitations. Over the past decade, our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space has increased dramatically. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (ie, snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics aids the clinician in treating these patients. Open and endoscopic treatment options are available for use when nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful.

Discussion

This nationally distributed survey highlights an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after THA. Most surgeons do not use imaging to aid with diagnosis, although 30% of respondents use ultrasound at least in a proportion of their cases. There was a near-equal distribution between first-line treatments, including physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and oral anti-inflammatories (Figure 2). The use of PRP is infrequent with no surgeons using PRP as first-line treatment and uncertainty regarding its potential benefits. Ideally, consensus guidelines would direct orthopaedic surgeons with best practices for management of GTPS. However, an absence of high-quality evidence on this topic would prevent any such guideline from being created or having meaningful utility.

Figure 2
Diagram representing most common methods of diagnosis (diagnosis), most common first-line treatment options (first-line therapy), and secondary treatment options for trochanteric bursitis (second-line therapy).

The estimated proportion of GTPS seen in our survey (8%) is in line with the best available evidence (3 to 17%). Using the results of our survey, this would suggest that nearly 5,000 patients are affected by post-THA GTPS each year and nearly 1,500 patients per year receive and subsequently fail first-line therapy for post-THA GTPS in Canada alone. Given the absence of standardized diagnostic guidelines, this may be an under-representation of total burden because of underdiagnosis.

In our study, more than 60% of surgeons use corticosteroids as either a first-line or second-line treatment, providing symptomatic relief through their anti-inflammatory properties. However, a proportion of symptoms generated in GTPS do not arise from inflammation itself, as evidenced by histologic specimens collected intraoperatively in recalcitrant cases. The absence of inflammation in these cases supports the use of treatment modalities other than corticosteroids, such as physiotherapy and PRP, the latter of which may provide benefit through cellular regenerations of torn abductor tendons. Given that the use of steroids may increase the risk of postoperative infection, alternative first-line treatments should continue to be studied.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^dd561292]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

The Hip Injection Trial (HIT), a pragmatic, three arm, parallel group, single blind, randomised controlled trial, was conducted within the National Health Service in two community based musculoskeletal services in England. The trial included a linked qualitative study and economic analysis (both reported separately). The protocol has been published previously.

Participants

We recruited participants after referral from primary care to orthopaedics, rheumatology, or two musculoskeletal interface services, as well as directly from general practice. We sent potentially eligible patients study information and invited them to attend hip clinics within the two musculoskeletal interface services. The patients were screened, and after consent had been obtained, they were treated by trained rheumatologists or extended scope physiotherapists.

Patients were eligible if they were aged ≥ 40 years with moderate to severe pain attributable to hip osteoarthritis present for six weeks or more and occurring on most days in the past month. Originally, we required participants to have a recorded hip pain intensity of ≥ 4 on a 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale on the day of assessment. In response to a suboptimal number of participants recruited (n = 48), this eligibility criterion was amended on 7 November 2016, with external steering committee approval, to require an average pain Numerical Rating Scale score of ≥ 4 over the preceding two weeks, with a minimum of 1 on the day of assessment, to take into account day-to-day variability in osteoarthritis symptoms. We based a diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis on clinical history and examination, supported by radiographical evidence within the past two years. We asked patients with bilateral symptoms to select the most severely affected hip for treatment.

Exclusion criteria were hip pain from other causes (eg, trochanteric bursitis, osteonecrosis, or pain referred from back); substantial injury to the affected hip within the past three months; malignancy (as a possible cause of hip pain); inflammatory arthritis; corticosteroid injection into the affected hip or ipsilateral trochanteric bursa within three months; any condition requiring regular oral steroid use; anticoagulant treatment; previous surgery or infection of the affected hip; suspicion of current infection; allergy or contraindication to the study drugs; pregnancy; unwillingness to receive an injection; or inability to give full informed consent.

‡Failed treatment at one month carried over as negative global perceived effect at three months.

When stratified by the number of injections — one injection (all blind injections plus intra-bursal on first attempt in fluoroscopy group) versus more than one injection (two or more attempts for intra-bursal spread in fluoroscopy group) — the outcomes for single and multiple injection groups were essentially comparable. Although the decrease in mean Oswestry disability index score was significantly greater in the single injection group (P = 0.003), we found a greater improvement in the multiple injection group for the SF-36 general health subscale (P = 0.02).

When examined by location of injection, no significant differences existed between the intra-bursal and extra-bursal groups. However, we noted trends for greater improvement in pain at rest at three months and the SF-36 general health category for intra-bursal injections, and for drug reduction and the SF-36 vitality index for extra-bursal spread of contrast.

At the time of discharge, blinding was assessed by an independent evaluator who asked patients which group they believed they were allocated to. Among the 56 patients who could give an answer, 23 guessed correctly, indicating adequacy of blinding. No complications were noted in any patient.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injection frequency and cumulative dose — survey practice and suggestion: An American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons survey of common injection practices yielded 537 members' responses, and most used a 3-month minimum interval between repeat IACS in the same joint. Based on the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks, up to 3 months, and the series of injections should be stopped when there is complete or acceptable pain relief or when the relief has plateaued, taking into consideration the maximum cumulative dose. Almost all responders used a local anesthetic mixture with the CSI, there were no distinctly defined early or lifetime limits, and there was a strong consensus for a 3-month corticosteroid-free preoperative interval.

### The role of arthroscopic bursectomy in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis [^7d5ce4f9]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The use of arthroscopy to treat recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis is reported and its role in treating this common clinical entity is discussed. During a 7-year period, 27 patients underwent this procedure. All patients complained of recurrent lateral hip pain despite at least 2 localized injections with corticosteroids. Minimum follow-up was 1 year, and the cases of 22 patients were reviewed after 5 years. Twenty-three of the 27 patients had good or excellent results immediately following the procedure and experienced no complications. At 1 year, only 1 patient had experienced symptom recurrence, and at 5 years, only 2 patients had had recurrence. All patients except 1 were satisfied with their outcome. Arthroscopically performed trochanteric bursectomy is a minimally invasive technique that appears to be both safe and effective for treating recalcitrant pain syndromes.

Figure 1
Graph showing the most commonly used first-line treatments of trochanteric bursitis in order of most common to least.

In patients who were resistant to physiotherapy and/or oral anti-inflammatories (54.8% and 23.3%, respectively), the most common treatment for trochanteric bursitis was corticosteroids and PRP. No other uses were reported for PRP while 31% reported using corticosteroids for both first-line and resistant cases and 9.5% used corticosteroids primarily for first-line treatment.

Among all patients with post-THA trochanteric bursitis, surgeons estimated that on average, 29.9% (SD: 25.7%) would eventually receive a corticosteroid injection. Only 0.2% of these patients (SD: 0.9%) received PRP injections. The most common number of corticosteroid injections was one injection (40%, range 1 to 3). All surgeons who provided PRP injections only provided a single injection (15%). Most injections were not administered under ultrasound guidance for either corticosteroid injections (82.5%) or PRP (75.0%).

Attitudes and Beliefs

The potential benefit of PRP in the setting of trochanteric bursitis was divided, with 54.8% of respondents being unsure, 14.3% thinking it has potential benefit, and 31% thinking that it does not. Furthermore, most of the respondents (85.7%) agreed that if high-quality evidence supported the use of PRP, and if cost was not an issue, they would use PRP in treating this condition. Finally, over half of all respondents (54.8%) stated that they would participate in a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of PRP in post-THA trochanteric bursitis.

TIMING AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TECHNIQUE Position of Patient The patient is placed in the lateral recumbent position with the knee flexed 20 to 30 degrees. Palpation of Landmarks Along the lateral thigh, follow the course of the iliotibial band across the femoral condyle to its insertion at Gerdy's tubercle. Approach and Needle Entry The needle is inserted at the point of maximal tenderness in the region of the lateral condyle. INDICATIONS Bursitis is manifested by swelling and tenderness anterior to the patella and can be the result of acute trauma. 25, 26 Bursitis-related prepatellar swelling must be differentiated from an intra-articular effusion. Aspiration of an inflamed bursa can be performed for relief of discomfort associated with a bursitis. If the symptoms of prepatellar bursitis are recurrent, corticosteroid injection may be performed.

TIMING AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Aspiration of the prepatellar bursa may be performed acutely for relief of swelling and discomfort. Corticosteroid injection can be performed in cases of chronic or persistent bursitis after a trial of more conservative therapy. Approach and Needle Entry Aspiration and injection are performed by placing the needle directly into the fluid-filled bursa from the side. Before injection with a corticosteroid, fluid should be aspirated from the bursa. If injecting, a hemostat is used to hold the needle in place while changing the syringe. Follow-Up Following aspiration of the prepatellar bursa, a pressure dressing should be applied, and the patient should remain in the supine position for several minutes. Following injection, the joint or injected region may be put through passive range of motion. The patient should remain in the office for 30 minutes after the injection to monitor for any adverse reactions.

In general, patients should avoid strenuous activity involving the injected region for several days. Patients should be cautioned that they may experience worsening symptoms during the first 24 to 48 hours related to a possible steroid flare, which can be treated with ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients should be instructed against the application of heat. A follow-up appointment should be scheduled within three weeks.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1ec03d45]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The trial took place between January 2007 and March 2008 at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a US military treatment facility operating in Landstuhl, Germany. A two tailed power analysis determined that a sample size of 64 had 90% power to detect a 1.5 point difference in the 0–10 numerical rating scale pain scores between groups at a significance level (α) of 0.05.

All procedures took place in a pain clinic in an ambulatory care setting; superficial anaesthesia was used. Inclusion criteria included pain of more than three months' duration, spontaneous pain in the lateral aspect of the hip, tenderness overlying the greater trochanter, and one of the following three minor diagnostic criteria: increased pain with extremes of rotation, abduction, or adduction; pain with forced hip abduction; and pseudoradicular pain extending down the lateral aspect of the thigh. Exclusion criteria included age under 18 years, trochanteric bursa injection within the previous nine months, coagulopathy, allergy to contrast dye, and unstable medical or psychiatric condition that might preclude an optimal treatment response.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^28da7a05]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether fluoroscopic guidance improves outcomes of injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Design Multicentre double blind randomised controlled study.

Setting Three academic and military treatment facilities in the United States and Germany.

Participants 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Interventions Injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic into the trochanteric bursa, using fluoroscopy (n = 32) or landmarks (that is, "blind" injections; n = 33) for guidance.

Main outcome measures Primary outcome measures: 0–10 numerical rating scale pain scores at rest and with activity at one month (positive categorical outcome predefined as ≥ 50% pain reduction either at rest or with activity, coupled with positive global perceived effect). Secondary outcome measures included Oswestry disability scores, SF-36 scores, reduction in drug use, and patients' satisfaction.

Results No differences in outcomes occurred favouring either the fluoroscopy or blind treatment groups. One month after injection the average pain scores were 2.7 at rest and 5.0 with activity in the fluoroscopy group compared with 2.2 and 4.0 in the blind injection group. Three months after the injection, 15 (47%) patients in the blind group and 13 (41%) in the fluoroscopy group continued to have a positive outcome.

Conclusion Although using fluoroscopic guidance dramatically increases treatment costs for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, it does not necessarily improve outcomes.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^e3ac7756]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including, but not limited to myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year with the prevalence being higher in women, and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter. Most cases of GTPS are self-limited with conservative measures, such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and behavior modification, providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

Dear Editor,

It was with great interest that we reviewed the article by Rho et al. "Deconstructing Chronic Low Back pain in the Older Adult-Step by Step Evidence and Expert-Based Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment. Part VIII: Lateral Hip and Thigh Pain". We applaud the authors for addressing this common issue of lateral hip pain, and their thoughtfulness and evidence supported discussion regarding the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) rather than the commonly used and inaccurate term "greater trochanteric bursitis". The authors nicely review the literature summarizing that there is a lack of findings on MRI and ultrasound, as well as in histological evidence to support the diagnosis of "bursitis" and/or "tendinitis" in the vast majority of these patients. Additionally, we fully agree with the authors' noting that there is a lack of inflammatory findings in patients suffering from GTPS and that effective treatment consists of strengthening the weak hip abductors that are often noted in these patients. We have found this to be true in the patients we have treated with GTPS. The authors also note the deficiency of evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections and both the potential systemic side effects and the now well-known toxic effects of corticosteroids to tenocytes, which they note "can potentially contribute to progressive tendinopathy and partial tears".

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^98345727]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Resolution of Case

The patient experienced significant pain relief from the corticosteroid injection for a few weeks. However, 5 weeks after the injection her lateral hip pain returned, now with pain radiating into her left lateral thigh, knee, and lateral lower leg. On repeat exam, she now had tenderness over her left ITB, mild pain with passive hip range of motion and lumbar extension, and a positive seated slump test on the left. At this time, she was felt to have GTPS and ITBS with superimposed lumbar radicular pain. Ultrasound confirmed the recurrence of bursitis in the GT. She continued to be resistant to physical therapy, and 1 month later her pain had not improved so she requested a repeat ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection.

The clinical course of this case highlights that corticosteroid injections for GTPS, even when an inflammatory bursitis is present, usually only provide temporary relief, and more definitive management of hip abductor strengthening must be strongly encouraged. In the setting of true bursitis and severe pain, a corticosteroid injection can help facilitate active engagement in a rehabilitation program. However, in older adults who are at risk for co-morbidities such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes, and delirium, minimizing the use of corticosteroids is advantageous. This case also demonstrates that evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain is often not straightforward. In this particular patient, she likely developed secondary lumbar pain, possibly in part due to compensatory mechanical changes in an attempt to relieve pain from her sub-optimally treated GTPS.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^8933b734]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

Clinical Course

The patient was diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) that included an inflammatory component as evidenced by bursitis seen on ultrasound. She was educated on hip abductor strengthening exercises, but she was not interested in performing the exercises regularly. Instead she requested a corticosteroid injection, so an ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa injection was performed by the ultrasound-trained physiatrist.

### Does surgical approach in total hip arthroplasty affect postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements? [^1d7504ff]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid injections following total hip arthroplasty (THA) are commonly used to address soft tissue pathology such as bursitis and tendinitis. The THA surgical approaches differ in the extent of muscle and soft tissue dissection. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of surgical approach on postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements when controlling for multiple covariates. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors associated with the various injection types.

Methods

This was a propensity-matched retrospective study of 10,907 THA patients from June 2016 to December 2022 at a single urban academic health center. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on the following surgical approaches: anterior (n = 4,287) and posterior (n = 6,620), then propensity-matched 1:1 with nearest neighbor matching to form two cohorts of 4,287 patients. Baseline characteristics and corticosteroid injection data for soft-tissue pathology were obtained and analyzed. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of patient and surgical factors on receiving postoperative steroid injections.

Results

A posterior approach conferred increased risk of postoperative injections (adjusted odds ratio 1.242, P = 0.001) after controlling for multiple covariates. The posterior approach also had higher total rates of greater trochanter bursitis injections postoperatively compared to the anterior group (11.5 versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). Both surgical approaches demonstrated comparable rates of iliopsoas bursitis injections (P = 0.39), gluteus medius tendinosis injections (P = 0.09), and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injections (P = 0.27). The strongest predictor of postoperative injections was a history of preoperative injection (adjusted odds ratio 3.772, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Posterior approach, women, and history of preoperative corticosteroid injection were identified as the strongest risk factors for postoperative greater trochanter bursitis injection or postoperative soft tissue injection. These factors should be considered when counseling patients on expected postoperative outcomes and the likelihood of corticosteroid injections following THA.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^af464a7d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) or trochanteric bursitis is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. To date, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS.

Methods:

To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

Results:

Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

Discussion:

There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

Objective

To determine whether fluoroscopic guidance improves outcomes of injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Design

Multicentre double blind randomised controlled study.

Setting

Three academic and military treatment facilities in the United States and Germany.

Participants

65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Interventions

Injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic into the trochanteric bursa, using fluoroscopy (n = 32) or landmarks (that is, "blind" injections; n = 33) for guidance.

Primary Outcome Measures

0–10 numerical rating scale pain scores at rest and with activity at one month (positive categorical outcome predefined as ≥ 50% pain reduction either at rest or with activity, coupled with positive global perceived effect). Secondary outcome measures included Oswestry disability scores, SF-36 scores, reduction in drug use, and patients' satisfaction.

Results

No differences in outcomes occurred favouring either the fluoroscopy or blind treatment groups. One month after injection the average pain scores were 2.7 at rest and 5.0 with activity in the fluoroscopy group compared with 2.2 and 4.0 in the blind injection group. Three months after the injection, 15 (47%) patients in the blind group and 13 (41%) in the fluoroscopy group continued to have a positive outcome.

Conclusion

Although using fluoroscopic guidance dramatically increases treatment costs for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, it does not necessarily improve outcomes.

Results

The figureshows the flow of participants through the study. Tables 1and 2show demographic data for participants in each study centre and by method of injection. Overall, neither baseline differences between study centres nor those between injection method groups were statistically significant, indicating that randomisation was successful. Most patients were women, in their mid-50s, not obese, and not using opioid analgesics, although patients at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center were substantially younger than those at the other sites, which reflects the nature of the beneficiaries of the US Department of Defense treated there. Patients randomised to receive a blind injection reported a mean duration of pain of 4.4 years, whereas those allocated to receive fluoroscopically guided injections had had pain for an average of 3.3 years. Average pain intensity at rest was moderate, but it increased to severe with activity. Baseline ability to function was severely limited in the blind injection group and moderately limited in the fluoroscopic group, although the between group differences were small.

### Factors associated with the outcome of ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection in greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^e55236ec]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Trochanteric bursa injections of corticosteroids and local anesthetics have been shown to provide pain relief for the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). However, symptom recurrence and incomplete symptom relief are common. The reason for the variation in response is unclear but may be related to disease-, treatment-, or patient-related factors.

Objective

To determine whether there are factors related to patient, treatment, or disease that can predict either the magnitude or duration of response to ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injections for GTPS.

Study Design

Retrospective evaluation.

Setting

A university hospital outpatient center.

Methods

Potential study participants were patients who underwent ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection at an outpatient rehabilitation department. Follow-up interviews were performed in a hospital visit at 1, 3, and 6 months after injection. The Harris Hip Score and the Verbal Numeric Pain Scale were used to evaluate clinical effectiveness of pain reduction and functional improvement at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Clinical data and ultrasound findings were obtained to assess the possible predictive factors for a good and durable response to ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection.

Results

Patients receiving ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injections had a statistically significant improvement in pain and hip function at 1, 3, and 6 months after the last injections. Of the 137 patients, 110 (80.3%), 95 (64.9%), and 77 (56.2%) patients achieved successful outcomes according to their 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up evaluations, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that patients with knee osteoarthritis and lumbar facet joint or sacroiliac joint pain experienced less therapeutic effect than those without the conditions at 6 months post-injection. Logistic regression analysis showed that the significant outcome predictors at the 6-month follow-up were facet joint or S-I joint pain (odds ratio = 0.304, P = 0.014) and knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio = 0.329, P = 0.021). Age, gender, body mass index, and pain duration were not independent predictors of a clinically successful outcome. There was no statistically significant association between effective treatment and the ultrasound findings of tendinosis, bursitis, partial or full-thickness tear, and enthesopathic changes.

Limitations

Retrospective chart review without a control group.

Conclusions

This study suggests that knee osteoarthritis and lower back pain might be associated with a poor outcome of ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection for GTPS. Assessment of these clinical factors should be incorporated into the evaluation and counseling of patients with GTPS who are candidates for ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection.

Key Words

Bursa injection, corticosteroid, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, knee osteoarthritis, lower back pain, lumbar facet joint, ultrasonography, S-I joint pain.

The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

Results

Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

Discussion

There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Dry needling versus cortisone injection in the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^7412b286]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Prospective, randomized, partially blinded. Background Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is the current terminology for what was once called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. Cortisone (corticosteroid) injection into the lateral hip has traditionally been the accepted treatment for this condition; however, the effectiveness of injecting the bursa with steroids is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial. Objective To investigate whether administration of dry needling (DN) is noninferior to cortisone injection in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. Methods Forty-three participants (50 hips observed), all with GTPS, were randomly assigned to a group receiving cortisone injection or DN. Treatments were administered over 6 weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the numeric pain-rating scale (0–10). The secondary outcome measure was the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (0–10). Medication intake for pain was collected as a tertiary outcome. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A noninferiority test for a repeated-measures design for pain and averaged function scores at 6 weeks (with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 for both outcomes) indicated noninferiority of DN versus cortisone injection (both, P < .01). Medication usage (P = 0.74) was not different between groups at the same time point. No adverse side effects were reported. Conclusion Cortisone injections for GTPS did not provide greater pain relief or reduction in functional limitations than DN. Our data suggest that DN is a noninferior treatment alternative to cortisone injections in this patient population. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1b.

### Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections for treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: greater trochanter bursa versus subgluteus medius bursa [^e6cc1ccf]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections into the greater trochanteric bursa as opposed to the subgluteus medius bursa in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 183 injections (149 performed in women, 34 performed in men; age range 23–90 years; median, 53 years) performed for treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome. A 10-cm visual analog scale survey was used to assess pain level before the procedure and 14 days after the procedure. A 3-mL corticosteroid solution was injected into either the greater trochanteric bursa or the subgluteus medius bursa under direct ultrasound guidance. Procedure images were retrospectively reviewed to determine the site of injection. Diagnostic images obtained at the time of the procedure were also reviewed for findings of tendinopathy, bursitis, and enthesopathy. Statistical analysis of differences in pain reduction was performed, as was analysis for association between pain relief and demographic variables of age, sex, previous injections, and ultrasound findings.

Results

Sixty-five injections met the inclusion criteria; 56 performed in women and nine performed in men (age range, 30–82 years; median, 53 years). Forty-one injections were into the greater trochanteric bursa and 24 into the subgluteus medius bursa. There was a statistically significant difference in pain reduction between greater trochanteric bursa and subgluteus medius bursa injections with a median pain reduction of 3 as opposed to 0 (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant association between pain relief and demographic variables or ultrasound findings.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injections into the greater trochanteric bursa may be more effective than injections into the subgluteus medius bursa for treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Table 3shows scores for each of the SF-36 scales stratified by injection method. The only statistically significant difference was in the mental health scale at the one month follow-up; patients who received a blind injection reported slightly better scores. Other differences tended to be in favour of the blind injection group, with the exception of emotional roles at baseline, physical roles and bodily pain at one month, and physical functioning at three months.

When examined by success at three months, the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study participants were similar (table 4). Despite the lack of statistical significance, an unsuccessful treatment at three months was more common among men, obese people, patients with shorter duration of pain, and those with greater disability on the Oswestry disability index.

We examined outcomes by injection method, number of injections (data not shown), and whether the injection was intra-bursal or extra-bursal (tables 5and 6). For the primary outcome measure, numerical rating scale score at one month, the mean hip pain score at rest declined from 5.1 to 2.7 (P = 0.0001) in the fluoroscopically guided injection group and from 4.6 to 2.2 (P = 0.0001) in the blind injection group. With respect to activity related pain intensity, scores in the fluoroscopy group fell from 7.8 to 5.0 (P < 0.0001) at one month, which was comparable to the improvement found in the blind injection group (decrease from 7.2 to 4.0; P < 0.0001). Other differences between the injection method groups also failed to reach statistical significance, apart from a greater decrease in disability among patients who received blind injections. However, we noted trends for greater improvement in pain at rest at three months in the fluoroscopy group and a positive global perceived effect in the blind injection group.

### Education plus exercise versus corticosteroid injection use versus a wait and see approach on global outcome and pain from gluteal tendinopathy: prospective, single blinded, randomised clinical trial [^5b3d59bb]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gluteal tendinopathy, often referred to as greater trochanteric bursitis or greater trochanteric pain syndrome, has a prevalence of 10–25% and is experienced by one in four women aged over 50 years. The disorder presents as pain and tenderness over the greater trochanter and often interferes with sleep and physical function. The level of disability and quality of life is equivalent to that of severe hip osteoarthritis, and effective management strategies are required.

Corticosteroid injections are commonly used to manage gluteal tendinopathy and although early outcomes are promising, medium term benefits are significantly less so, and long term outcomes are no better than a wait and see approach. A contemporary approach to managing other tendinopathies combines education to reduce load on the tendon during sustained postures and function (that is, load management) with exercisesthat target the underlying pathology. This approach has not been tested in randomised clinical trials for gluteal tendinopathy. One non-randomised clinical trial compared a home exercise programme with corticosteroid injection use and radial shock wave treatment, reporting that home exercise performed poorly by comparison at one and four months. Load management advice was not provided and exercise was not specific to the involved gluteal tendons and muscles.

We conducted a randomised clinical trial to compare the effects of a programme of education about tendon load management plus specific exercise, a single corticosteroid injection, and a wait and see approach on pain and global improvement in individuals with gluteal tendinopathy. The hypothesis was that both education plus exercise and corticosteroid injection use would be better than a wait and see approach in the short term (after eight weeks), whereas education plus exercise would be better than corticosteroid injection use in the longer term (after 52 weeks).

### Response to: rho et al. "Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain" [^5fc5abe1]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

It is therefore puzzling that the treatment provided in the clinical case presented in this review was an "ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection". In fact, in this case (as often occurs in clinical practices across the United States) the patient unfortunately underwent two ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections! This treatment would not only appear to be not indicated based upon the current literature cited in the review by Rho et al. but also potentially harmful in this 90-year-old patient with a history of several compression fractures. In addition, the known lack of efficacy of these injections results in not only a poor outcome but also increased cost. The review failed to include other types of injection treatments for this treatment, including simple needle of the tendon, that is, needle tenotomy, ultrasound-guided dextrose injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection (PRP). In a multicenter case series, Mautner et al. noted a significant benefit using PRP on a variety of tendons, including the hip abductor tendons, namely the gluteus minimus and medius tendons, which commonly demonstrated tendinopathic changes in these patients. Although the current scientific evidence for efficacy of PRP injection is limited, it is superior to the level of evidence for many current treatments for GTPS and certainly superior to corticosteroid injections. In our clinical experience, we have found that a single PRP injection of a high-concentration, leukocyte-poor PRP is effective in 90% of patients suffering from GTPS who have failed other conservative measures without the need for additional interventions. In addition, there have been no harmful effects documented in the literature regarding PRP injection of the tendons inserting onto the greater trochanter.

The practice of medicine requires us to provide the most effective evidence-based treatments to patients with the first caveat of "First DO No Harm". We would argue that injection of corticosteroids for GTPS would not be supported by evidence-based medicine both in terms of effective treatment and avoiding the potential harmful effects.

Randomisation and treatment

A physician not involved in randomisation enrolled and treated all participants. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either fluoroscopically guided or landmark guided (that is, "blind") trochanteric bursa injections. A research nurse not involved in patient care randomised participants in blocks of four via pre-sealed envelopes at Johns Hopkins and the two military institutions, which we considered as a single entity. Patients were placed in the lateral position with the affected side up, after which the most tender area was marked over the anticipated site of the bursa. A "sham" cross table antero-posterior image of the femur was taken to facilitate blinding. Using only landmarks to guide needle insertion, the physician inserted a 22 gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle into the suspected bursa. The physician then injected 0.5 mL of contrast and took a true antero-posterior image to determine whether the contrast was within one of the subgluteus maximus or subgluteus medius trochanteric bursas. In those patients randomised to the "blind injection" group, the physician injected a 4 mL solution containing 60 mg of depo-methylprednisolone and 2.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine regardless of whether the contrast entered the bursa. For patients in the fluoroscopy group, the same solution was injected only if the image revealed intra-bursal spread. If the injection was extra-bursal, the physician then readjusted the needle and repeated the process until intra-bursal spread of contrast was confirmed, at which point the injectate was administered. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patient was asked which group they thought they were allocated to.

Trochanteric Bursitis

Trochanteric bursitis (TB), or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae, has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the GT and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns. Teng et alinvestigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of tb was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed. Furthermore, White et al recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of trochanteric bursitis TB, evaluating 1094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed TB. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing TB. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of TB in either univariate or multivariate model.

Clinical Presentation

Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT to palpation.

Diagnostic Studies

Although in most cases, diagnosis is made clinically, advance imaging, metal suppression MRI, or ultrasound (US) can be used to rule out concomitant abductor pathology.

Treatment

Trochanteric bursitis initially is managed conservatively with simple analgesia, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and corticosteroid injections. For refractory cases where conservative measures have failed for a prolonged period, open techniques combining iliotibial band release with trochanteric bursectomy, an arthroscopic approach to debride and excise the inflamed bursa, are recommended. Van Hofwegen et alpresented a series including 12 patients who underwent endoscopic trochanteric bursectomy with a high patient satisfaction, where 10 out the 12 patients reported substantial pain relief.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^535d32c7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) or trochanteric bursitis is classically described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. Although diagnosis can be made with clinical examination alone, an ultrasound or MRI is sometimes used to increase sensitivity.GTPS can include a multitude of pathologies, including gluteus medius/minimus tears, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, and snapping hip syndrome (coxa saltans).

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common and successful operations in Canada, with over 95% of patients reporting good or excellent outcomes. However, up to 17% of patients can suffer from GTPS postoperatively.GTPS can be associated with altered hip biomechanics from implant malposition or from direct injury to the abductor musculature intraoperatively. Other causes of GTPS include inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter secondary to the surgical incision; however, histopathologic studies often find little evidence of inflammation. It has been argued that a surgical approach for THA can affect the prevalence of GTPS. Advocates for using a direct anterior approach (DAA) adduce a decrease in postoperative limp and GTPS because neither the iliotibial band nor the abductor musculature is violated. Patients who suffer from GTPS postoperatively are known to have impaired functional status with reduced walking speed and slower timed up and go tests. Recalcitrant cases of GTPS may necessitate surgical débridement, increasing the risk of surgical complications and infection.

To date, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS. Management options for GTPS are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). When considering PRP in particular, physicians can use numerous different combinations and filtration rates — rendering the injections measurably different between treatment centers. Overall, there exists a paucity of high-quality evidence surrounding the ideal management of GTPS, with a lack of a collective opinion from clinicians on the treatment of this common problem.

The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes of Canadian arthroplasty surgeons because it relates to the management of GTPS after THA. Our objectives were to understand the current practice paradigms and identify areas for future research and guideline development.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^cc383512]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most common local cause of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults is GTPS. Gluteus medius weakness is often a significant contributor to the development of GTPS. As a result, hip abductor strengthening exercises should be the first-line treatment of this syndrome in conjunction with medication. While medications and modalities may provide temporary symptomatic relief, pain will likely recur if the underlying weakness is not addressed. Additionally, since GTPS and other lumbopelvic conditions often coexist, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for the possibility of multiple pain generators, as well.

Key Points

Lateral hip and/or thigh pain in the older adult with CLBP can be from a number of causes, with those most common being greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), hip osteoarthritis, lumbar radiculopathy/radiculitis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Meralgia paresthetica also should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Often lateral hip and/or thigh pain is multifactorial.
Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain and is usually due to weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. Hip abductor strengthening is the first-line treatment for GTPS.
True GT bursitis causing GTPS occurs in a minority of cases; therefore, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly, and ideally only when there is imaging evidence of bursitis. Injection should always be accompanied by a hip abductor strengthening program.
In older adults with CLBP, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is less commonly described than GTPS. However, hip abductor strengthening is part of the first-line treatment for both GTPS and ITBS.
Lumbar radiculopathy (i.e. pain + weakness) requires aggressive evaluation and treatment to avoid progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Lumbar radiculitis (pain without weakness) can be evaluated and managed more conservatively.

### Corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial in primary care [^621d0535]. Annals of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We undertook a study to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in primary care patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS).

Methods

We evaluated the effect of corticosteroid injections compared with expectant treatment (usual care) in a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial in the Netherlands. Patients (aged 18 to 80 years) with GTPS visiting 81 participating primary care physicians were randomly allocated to receive either local corticosteroid injections (n = 60) or usual care (n = 60). Primary outcomes of pain severity (numerical rating scale 0 to 10) and recovery (yes or no total or major recovery) were evaluated at 3-month and 12-month follow-up visits. Adverse events were collected at 6 weeks.

Results

At the 3-month follow-up visit, 34% of the patients in the usual care group had recovered compared with 55% in the injection group (adjusted OR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.14–5.00, number needed to treat = 5). Pain severity at rest and on activity decreased in both groups, but the decrease was greater in the injection group, for an adjusted difference in pain at rest of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.31–2.05) and in pain with activity of 1.30 (95% CI, 0.32–2.29). At the 12-month follow-up, 60% of the patients in the usual care group had recovered compared with 61% in the injection group (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.50–2.27). Pain severity at rest and on activity decreased in both groups and the 12-month follow-up showed no significant differences, with adjusted differences of 0.14 (95% CI, -0.75 to 1.04) for pain at rest and 0.45 (95% CI, -0.55 to 1.46) for pain with activity. Aside from a short period with superficial pain at the site of the injection, no differences in adverse events were found.

Conclusion

In this first randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections vs usual care in GTPS, a clinically relevant effect was shown at a 3-month follow-up visit for recovery and for pain at rest and with activity. At a 12-month follow-up visit, the differences in outcome were no longer present.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^630479d6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The complexity in both treatment and diagnosis of GTPS reflects the multiplicity of attitudes and perceptions toward this condition. In a recent systematic review of GTPS after THA, more than 10 different diagnostic criteria for trochanteric pain have been reported, but only a single tool has reported its sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. The lack of consensus in the treatment approach is evident through the multiple treatments used, including PRP, steroids, a variety of physiotherapy protocols, peripheral nerve stimulation, local anesthetic injections, and others. Five studies reported on the utility of corticosteroid injections either alone (one study) or in combination with home physiotherapy treatment protocols. Four studies reported on treatment of trochanteric bursitis resistant to nonsurgical management using either gluteal bursectomy or iliotibial band lengthening. No studies reported on outcomes with a follow-up of longer than 1year, limiting the reliability of outcome assessments.

In our study, surgical approach was not associated with a notable difference in the surgeon-perceived rates of post-THA GTPS. While it is important to consider that this is based on surgeon estimates and not real data, it is still interesting to compare these estimates across approaches. Although a lack of notable difference among the various approaches is consistent with previous clinical literature, lower rates of GTPS are sometimes touted as a potential benefit of certain approaches. Among the myriad of potential causes of GTPS, gluteus medius/minimus tears (i.e. "bald trochanter" syndrome) can occur with any surgical approach either because the insertion is not visualized or because it fails to heal after intraoperative repair.

By contrast, the literature surrounding the treatment of GTPS in patients who have not previously received total hip replacement is of considerably higher methodologic quality. Since 2002, there have been 13 randomized controlled trials evaluating nonsurgical treatment of GTPS. The best available evidence from these trials suggests that PRP and physiotherapy were likely to be somewhat more effective than corticosteroids and anti-inflammatories alone in reducing pain or increasing hip function at 3 to 6 months.

Results

Characteristics of the Respondents

A total of 54 responses were received (34.4% response rate). All respondents were staff orthopaedic surgeons who regularly perform THA. The mean age of respondents was 47.5 (SD ± 12.2) years. Respondents from all 10 Canadian provinces were included, and the median year of graduation from residency was 2005 (range 1975 to 2017). More than half of all respondents primarily practiced at an academic center (58.8%) while 37.3% worked primarily at community sites and only 3.9% worked in rural settings.

Practice Patterns

The most commonly used surgical approach for THA was direct lateral (52.4%), followed by the posterior/posterolateral approach (35.7%) and the DAA (11.9%). Diagnosis of post-THA trochanteric bursitis was solely clinical for most of the respondents (69.1%), with only 4.8% of surgeons routinely obtaining a diagnostic ultrasound. Another 26.2% said that they sometimes obtained diagnostic ultrasound. The respondents estimated that, on average, 8% of their THA patients developed postoperative trochanteric bursitis (range 0 to 20%). This estimate was lower among those using the DAA approach (5.0%) compared with those using the lateral (8.1%) or posterior (8.9%) approaches; however, this difference was nonsignificant (F = 1.98, P = 0.17). The most common first-line treatments of trochanteric bursitis were oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%) (multiple selections allowed, Figure 1). The median length of physiotherapy prescribed was 6 weeks (range 3 to 12) while the median time for physiotherapy to be considered "failed" was 12 weeks (range 3 to 52). On average, 31% (SD: 26.8%) of patients with post-THA trochanteric bursitis were estimated to fail physiotherapy.

### Non-surgical treatment as the first step to manage peritrochanteric space disorders [^ea88e77e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) or lateral hip pain terms include external snapping hip, trochanteric bursitis and gluteus medius or minimus pathology. The aim of this review is to update the most recent knowledge about non-surgical management of peritrochanteric disorders.

Methods

A literature review was performed including articles most relevant in the last years that were focused in non-surgical treatment of peritrochanteric disorders.

Results

Conservative treatment still has a place and includes activity modification, NSAIDs, analgesics, physiotherapy, home training, local corticosteroid injection (CSI) and shock wave therapy (SWT). These non-surgical alternatives have demonstrated good clinical results with low rate of complications.

Conclusion

Most patients tend to resolve GTPS or lateral hip pain with non-surgical management in the mid-term but when everything failed, surgical options should be evaluated. The next frontier that will be a game changer is to determine an individualized treatment plan based on the exact pathology.

A hip-strengthening program is considered to be first-line treatment for patients with GTPS since it directly addresses the biomechanical cause of pain. If a patient is resistant to engaging in a strengthening program and/or is severely limited by pain from GTPS, if possible, we prefer referral to a musculoskeletal specialist prior to considering treatment with a corticosteroid injection for two reasons. First, using ultrasound or MRI to identify whether bursitis (i.e. active inflammation) is actually present helps the clinician determine how likely the patient is to benefit from an anti-inflammatory medication such as a corticosteroid. (When available and in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, ultrasound is superior to MRI because it is faster, cheaper, and provides real-time imaging which can also be used for visualization during injection.) Second, cadaveric studies have demonstrated that there are seven bursae surrounding the GT. Therefore, in order to maximize a clinical response to a corticosteroid injection, it should be performed under ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider into the appropriate bursa demonstrating inflammation. An experienced specialist can use ultrasound to evaluate for bursitis and accurately administer any indicated injection during a regular office visit, without the need for delay to obtain an MRI to confirm inflammation. Also, there is often concomitant gluteal tendinopathy in the form of tendon tears or tendinosis. It is possible that decreasing the inflammation of the bursa will result in incomplete pain relief. Of course, patients receiving a corticosteroid injection should still be encouraged to pursue physical therapy for hip abductor (especially gluteus medius) strengthening in order to minimize the chance for pain recurrence.

### Deep gluteal pain in orthopaedics: a challenging diagnosis [^c26b1e7c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Identifying the specific source of gluteal pain can elude the most seasoned orthopaedic diagnosticians. Patients will often present with a protracted course of symptoms, and failure to successfully identify and treat the underlying etiology leads to frustration for both patient and clinician. Pain deep in the buttocks can arise from compression, inflammation, or injury of one or more of the structures in this anatomically dense area. Although sacroiliitis, hip arthritis, and trochanteric bursitis may also masquerade as gluteal pain, sciatic nerve irritation in its various presentations causes a substantial percentage of cases. Deep gluteal syndrome, hamstring syndrome, and ischiofemoral impingement can have overlapping presentations but can be differentiated by clinical examination and judiciously placed diagnostic corticosteroid injections. Although nonsurgical management, including physical therapy, relative rest, and injections represent the mainstay of treatment, open and endoscopic surgical approaches have yielded encouraging success rates in refractory cases.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part IV, hip [^9b2a806c]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Following a Delphi-based consensus, 10 statements regarding image-guided musculoskeletal interventional procedures on joints, tendons, and bursae around the hip were provided by a panel of 53 experts from the Ultrasound and Interventional Subcommittees of the ESSR. According to the results of this consensus, the evidence for procedures performed in the hip joint and trochanteric region is sparse. Specifically, statement #7 concerning the safety and higher accuracy and effectiveness of image-guided intra-articular hip injections than palpation-guided injections is the only one reaching the highest level of evidence, thus establishing the added value of imaging to guide hip injections. Interestingly, prospective randomized trials have proven the efficacy of image-guided corticosteroid hip injection to obtain short-term pain relief, with similar outcomes of ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid with that of corticosteroid and PRP in hip osteoarthritis, allowing reaching level of evidence 2 in statements #9 and #10. Even procedures aimed to treat GTPS have reached level of evidence 2, with similar outcomes obtained using image- and palpation-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic injections, as well as with ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, needling, and PRP injection. On the other hand, the evidence for the remaining procedures on iliopsoas, pubic symphysis, hamstring tendons, and ischiogluteal bursa is still low. Indeed, no randomized clinical trials or well-designed prospective longitudinal trials have been published on these interventions. Notably, a strong consensus has been achieved in 100% of statements provided by the experts, with all of them having agreed on the clinical indications of these procedures, except for one disagreement concerning statement #6.

In conclusion, 10 statements concerning image-guided treatment procedures around the hip have been collected by a panel of experts from the ESSR. There remains low evidence in the existing literature on some of these interventional procedures. Further large prospective randomized trials are therefore essential to further clarify and consolidate the additional role of imaging to guiding musculoskeletal interventional procedures around the hip.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

Case History

Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and SCARE Guidelines were followed in preparation of this case report. The patient is a 75-year-old female with a known history of asthma, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. In her early twenties, she underwent high-dose prednisone therapy for asthma but had no other history of long-term high-dose corticosteroid therapy prior to hip pain. Her past surgical history is significant for L4-L5 posterior decompression and interbody fusion.

The patient initially presented to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation service with hip pain. She was diagnosed with bilateral trochanteric bursitis and early bilateral hip osteoarthritis (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis demonstrating bilateral trochanteric bursitis and early bilateral hip osteoarthritis.

She received bilateral trochanteric injections, followed by physical therapy (PT). Despite PT, the patient's hip and back pain worsened. Due to ongoing pain, trochanteric injections were repeated and in addition for pain thought to be related to the hip joint, she also received intra-articular injections. She received an intraarticular right hip injection of 4 mL of 5 mg/mL ropivacaine, 5 mL of 10 mg/mL lidocaine, and 1 mL of 40 mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide and an injection with the same concentration of medication into the right gluteus medius tendon insertion. Two weeks later, she received corticosteroid injections (same doses/strengths as prior) into her left hip joint and left gluteus medius tendon. Over the next two months she improved symptomatically.

Conclusion

THA surgeons in Canada often use physical examination alone to diagnose GTPS after THA. Surgeons treat with oral anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy, or corticosteroid injections, with up to one-third of patients failing initial therapy. Although few surgeons use PRP, there is substantial interest in its potential efficacy for treating GTPS. Additional research is needed to evaluate the use of PRP, along with standardized physiotherapy and steroid injection protocols in the management in GTPS, a common and often debilitating condition.

### Lateral hip pain: does imaging predict response to localized injection? [^0c6aff01]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is a common complaint in patients with a history of lower back pain from spinal disease. These patients often are diagnosed and treated for trochanteric bursitis because of localized pain and tenderness in the lateral hip. We presumed numerous scintigraphic features could provide diagnostic criteria for diagnosing gluteus medius tendinitis and trochanteric bursitis. A study was designed to assess the scintigraphic criteria for diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis and to evaluate the relationship of trochanteric bursitis to gluteus medius tendinitis and lumbar degenerative disease in predicting relapse after injection. We evaluated 97 patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome to find a correlation between trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tendinitis, and spinal degenerative disease using scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. We also evaluated predictors for responding to trochanteric injection of local anesthetic/glucocorticoid injection. We found a correlation between lumbar degenerative disease, gluteus medius tendinopathy, and trochanteric bursitis. Of these, 30 of 48 patients (63%) responded to injection of local anesthetic and glucocorticoids. The major predictor of relapse of pain after injection in 18 patients was the presence of moderate to severe lumbar degenerative disease seen on scintigraphic imaging. We propose a mechanistic model of the greater trochanteric pain syndrome to explain the interrelationship and response to therapy. Scintigraphy can provide sensitive and specific diagnoses of gluteus medius tendinitis and trochanteric bursitis.

Results

Ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas peri-tendinous/bursal injections with local anesthetic and corticosteroids are both safe and feasible and provide good pain relief in symptomatic patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy. This procedure may also be used to exclude the iliopsoas tendon as a cause of hip or groin pain in both arthroplasty and non-arthroplasty patients. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Iliopsoas bursa injection under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance for treating iliopsoas tendinopathy or bursitis are feasible and accurate. However, there are no studies comparing the different injection techniques neither to compare the different outcome of palpation-guided and image-guided injections. In ultrasound-guided injections, dynamic injection with local anesthetic may be used to ensure needle placement in the bursa. Complications are rare, minor, and transient. Iliopsoas bursa injection may be useful to determine the origin of pain, particularly in patients with hip arthroplasty. Adler et al observed that ultrasound-guided iliopsoas injections with local anesthetic and steroids after hip replacement provided relief to most patients (90%) with iliopsoas tendinosis/bursitis. Authors reported a lower success rate in non-arthroplasty patients related to the several involved conditions in hip pain, although 64% of these patients responded positively thereby confirming the diagnosis of iliopsoas tendinosis and highlighting those patients who may benefit from a surgical tendon release. Han et al showed that, in 178 patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy, ultrasound-guided iliopsoas corticosteroid and local anesthetic injection improved outcomes at 6 weeks, regardless of coexisting intra-articular hip abnormalities. Patients without intra-articular hip abnormalities showed significantly greater clinical improvement than patients with intra-articular abnormalities. This suggests that the presence of underlying intra-articular hip abnormalities may limit the clinical effect of iliopsoas injections in patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy, perhaps due to the pain being multifactorial. Fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas bursa injection demonstrated a significant clinical improvement and pain reduction at 1-month post-injection in about half of the 39 patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy tested by Agten et al. Sometimes more than one injection is required to relieve the symptoms.
A single ultrasound- or fluoroscopy-guided corticosteroid and local anesthetic injection into the symphyseal cleft and/or site of abnormality detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the rectus abdominis or adductor longus insertion may result in clinical improvement in athletes with pubalgia. Level of evidence: 4 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% A single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic injection into the area of degeneration or fraying of the rectus abdominis and/or adductor longus led to clinical improvement in 12 patients with pubalgia, with all of them having returned to their preinjury activity level. Fluoroscopy-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic peri-insertional injection into the symphyseal cleft and to the site of MRI-depicted abnormality resulted in clinical improvement in near 90% of 45 athletes with pubalgia, with a sustained response in 60% after 6 months. An isolated superior cleft sign on MRI is more frequently associated with complete recovery. Furthermore, an initial complete response seems to be a prognostic factor, capable of predicting sustained response.
Ultrasound-guided needling and autologous blood product injection are both safe and feasible and may improve the clinical symptoms in hamstring tendinopathy. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Percutaneous ultrasound-guided dry needling of tendons around the hip and pelvis, including hamstring tendons, may be a safe and effective treatment for tendinopathy and partial tears. In a single retrospective study, improvement of patient symptoms after ultrasound-guided fenestration has been described in 82% of patients with hip and pelvis tendon pathology for up to 70 days, with no complications. Several studies report the use of PRP in hamstring injuries but the limitations and variability in study design (platelet and leucocyte concentration in PRP, kit used to prepare the PRP from the autologous blood, the ideal PRP volume to administer, frequency of injection, post-injection rehabilitation care) may limit their validity. Pain and functional improvement after PRP infiltration varied from good results at 6-month follow-up and 1-week follow-up to no differences in clinical outcomes at 4- and 8-week follow-up. Despite limited evidence, the potential side effects of PRP are so minimal that its use for proximal hamstring pathology might be considered when other non-invasive measures are unsuccessful, but only after exhausting more established therapies.
Image- and palpation-guided corticosteroid-anesthetic injections are both feasible, safe, and effective to treat greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) providing clinical improvement up to 3–6 months. Ultrasound-guided injections seem to be more effective, compared to palpation-guided injections, when performed into the greater trochanteric bursa. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Injection therapies for trochanteric bursitis with palpation guidance or image guidance are both safe and effective for relieving GTPS, resulting in a significant reduction in pain up to three months. Ultrasound- and palpation-guided injections of the trochanteric bursa have also shown similar clinical results at 2-week and 6-month follow-up. According to some authors, benefit in pain reduction from ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa corticosteroid-anesthetic injection might decrease at 6 and 12 months. McEvoy et al reported that corticosteroid injections into the greater trochanteric bursa are more effective than injections into the subgluteus medius bursa. Some authors reported that injections for gluteus medius bursitis were weakly associated with long-term pain reduction. One randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of peri-tendinous injections of glucocorticoids around the gluteal tendons showed no statistically significant outcome difference compared with normal saline injections. Even though fluoroscopy can be used to successfully inject the trochanteric bursa or subgluteus medius bursa in patients with GTPS, in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, fluoroscopically guided injections were not associated with superior clinical outcomes at 1 month compared to palpation-guided injections alone.
Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, needling, and PRP injection for GTPS are all valuable measures to reduce pain and no clear evidence exists to define one treatment as superior to the others. PRP may have more long-lasting clinical improvement than corticosteroid injections, although high-quality evidence is still missing. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Ultrasound-guided tendon dry needling and PRP injections are valuable and relatively safe treatment strategies in patients with GTPS refractory to conservative measures. Both methods showed similar outcomes at 1 and 2 weeks and at 3 months post treatment in a single blind prospective study. According to one randomized double-blind control trial, there is no difference in pain relief and functional improvement between ultrasound-guided PRP and corticosteroid intratendinous injection for GTPS at 2–60 days. However, patients receiving PRP achieved greater clinical improvement at 12 weeks. One prospective randomized double-blind study showed better results with corticosteroid than PRP injections in the greater trochanteric bursa. Fitzpatrick et al and Begkas et al presented better and longer-lasting clinical results when treating GTPS with ultrasound-guided PRP injections compared to corticosteroid. Such results were confirmed by a systematic review, representing a safe and effective alternative to surgery. Another prospective controlled randomized study found better and longer-lasting clinical results (at 24 weeks) in patients with GTPS treated by ultrasound-guided PRP injections compared to corticosteroid injections. However, Ali et al underlined the absence of adequately powered studies providing high-quality evidence, especially when the global pathology of GTPS is considered. Thus, the role of PRP in this setting still needs further investigations. Of note, based on a single prospective randomized controlled trial, physiotherapy (education and exercise) and a single ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and anesthetic for gluteal tendinopathy resulted in higher rates of global improvement and lower pain intensity than no treatment at 8 and 52 weeks. Education and exercise showed better global improvement than administration of a corticosteroid and anesthetic, but with no significant difference in pain intensity, thus supporting physiotherapy as an effective management approach.
Ultrasound-guided ischiogluteal bursa injections are technically feasible in cadavers but no clinical data is available. Level of evidence: 4 Agree, n = 52; disagree, n = 1; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 98% The ischiogluteal bursa is located posterior and inferior to the ischial tuberosity and deep to the inferior portion of the gluteus maximus muscle. Ischiogluteal bursitis can present as an acute or chronic condition. The etiology includes direct trauma to the ischial tuberosity, abnormal friction between the ischial tuberosity, hamstring origin, and overlying gluteus maximus, and underlying hamstring tendinopathy. Ischiogluteal bursa injection can be performed under ultrasound guidance in cadavers but there are no data about indications and procedure outcome.
Image-guided intra-articular hip injections are well-tolerated and safe procedures, which are more accurate and effective than palpation-guided injections. Level of evidence: 1 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Several studies reported that image-guided intra-articular hip injections improve the accuracy of intra-articular placement. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that ultrasound-guided injections are significantly more accurate than palpation-guided injections (using anatomical landmarks). The accuracy of palpation-guided injections ranges from 67 to 88%, which improves to 97% when ultrasound is used. Ultrasound has also the great advantage of no ionizing radiations as compared to fluoroscopy. Intra-articular treatment with imaging guidance is well-tolerated and safe for hip osteoarthritis patients. The most common adverse effect is moderate pain during injection or lasting for a short time after injection, which usually resolves without the need for treatment.
Positive response to image-guided diagnostic intra-articular injections with anesthetics can help confirm the intra-articular origin of hip pain. Level of evidence: 3 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% When the pain generator site is unconfirmed, diagnostic injections may be used to diagnose a variety of underlying intra-articular hip pathologies. Intra-articular diagnostic injections have been reported to be a 90% reliable indicator of intra-articular abnormalities and nonresponse to injection was shown to represent a strong negative predictor of surgical outcome. Complete relief of hip pain following intracapsular injection of local anesthetic was reported associated with good surgical outcome following joint replacement. Odoom et al showed that positive response to pre-operative anesthetic injection into a hip is associated with positive prognosis after hip surgery. However, for femoroacetabular impingement, injections may be more useful in non-responders.
Image-guided corticosteroid hip injection is effective in providing short-term pain relief and can transiently improve function in patients with osteoarthritis. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Hip intra-articular corticosteroid injection may be effective in delivering short-term, but clinically significant, pain reduction in patients with hip osteoarthritis, and may also lead to transient improvement in function. The treatment effect appears to be of rapid onset with a large group of responders reported at 1-week post-injection. The magnitude of pain reduction and functional improvement decreases thereafter, although two trials reported clinically significant differences in both pain and function at 8 weeks post-injection. Some reports show that patients with less advanced disease respond better to corticosteroids compared with patients with more advanced disease. A recent study on 110 patients (52 hips and 58 knees) showed that intra-articular ketorolac or triamcinolone injections provided similar improvement. Furthermore, due to its differing mechanism of action, ketorolac may not produce additional cartilage damage.
Ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of hyaluronic acid is not different for pain and function improvement from placebo, corticosteroid (at 1 and 6 months), and PRP (at 6 and 12 months) in patients with hip osteoarthritis. No different outcomes have been observed by using different hyaluronic acid formulations. Level of evidence: 2 Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100% Ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of hyaluronic acid does not significantly reduce pain or improve function when compared to placebo in short-term follow-up, with mild impact on pain and disability up to 3 months, and no difference at 6 months. Brander et al suggested that hyaluronic acid injection significantly improved pain scores compared to baseline at 6-months, although they did not demonstrate a superior effect over placebo. A meta-analysis found that intra-articular placebo is effective for osteoarthritis, particularly with regards to self-reported pain and functional outcome measurements, probably due to the dilution of proinflammatory cytokines by saline. Regarding the different concoctions, published data showed that most hyaluronic acid formulations were not significantly different in terms of clinical and functional outcomes.

### Hip pain: dry needling versus cortisone injections [^a4c2abff]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is chronic, intermittent pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip. The medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa was the source of such pain, which led to the use of corticosteroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, researchers now believe that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved. A study published in the April 2017 issue of JOSPT explores dry needling as an alternative to cortisone injections to reduce pain and improve function in patients with GTPS.

### Corticosteroid injections for common musculoskeletal conditions [^37f51588]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Family physicians considering corticosteroid injections as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for musculoskeletal diagnoses will find few high-quality studies to assist with evidence-based decision making. Most studies of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, bursitis, or neuropathy include only small numbers of patients and have inconsistent long-term follow-up. Corticosteroid injections for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis result in short-term improvements in pain and range of motion. For subacromial impingement syndrome, corticosteroid injections provide short-term pain relief and improvement in function. In medial and lateral epicondylitis, corticosteroid injections offer only short-term improvement of symptoms and have a high rate of symptom recurrence. Corticosteroid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome may help patients avoid or delay surgery. Trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis may be treated effectively with corticosteroid injections. Patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis may have short-term symptom relief with corticosteroid injections.

### Therapeutic hip injections: is the injection volume important? [^2895cf21]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess whether an increased volume of local anaesthetic injection given with intra-articular steroids improves symptom relief in osteoarthritis of the hip.

Materials and Methods

One hundred and ten patients with hip osteoarthritis were randomized into two groups (A and B). All patients were given 40 mg triamcinolone and 2 mL bupivicaine, and patients from group B were also given 6 mL of sterile water for injection. Change in WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index Version 3.1) scores from baseline to 3 months were calculated and assessed for clinical and statistical significance. The patients were assessed for pain at 2 weekly intervals using the Oxford pain chart.

Results

Patients from group B showed some reduction in stiffness (7%) and improved function (3%) compared with group A, and there were more clinical responders in these two categories. However, there was no significant statistical or clinical difference in WOMAC scores between the two groups at 3 months. There was also no statistical difference in pain symptoms between the two groups during the study period, measured at 2 weekly intervals. One hundred and two patients reached the study endpoint; eight patients who had bilateral hip injections were subsequently included in the analysis, and these patients did not alter the findings significantly.

Conclusions

Published total injection volumes used for treating osteoarthritis of the hip with intra-articular steroids vary from 3 to 12 ml. The present study has shown that there is no detriment to using a larger volume of injectate, and recommends that practitioners use total volumes between 3 and 9 ml.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — image-guided injections for diagnosis consist of a local anesthetic and possibly a corticosteroid, and peri-injection and postinjection examination demonstrating an immediate decrease of pain is considered indicative of chondral damage independent of extra-articular pathology; the clinician should consider the role of injection therapy in patient management, particularly if improvement in pain is delayed or impacting the ability to restore optimal functioning.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^a2a728b7]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopaedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy (PT), stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients. However, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition. We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed and is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement leading to the development of bursitis. We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release. Our technique involves 2 incisions — one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band, and the other 4 cm distal and along the posterior border. The 30 degrees arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear off the surface of the iliotibial band, so that it may be adequately visualized. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^521080dc]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroid injections are described for symptom relief with noted risks. Both over-the-counter and prescribed anti-inflammatory agents including NSAIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors, and steroid injections are recommended as part of a multidisciplinary treatment approach to hip OA, and randomized clinical trials have shown NSAIDs can be effective for the temporary relief of symptoms and improvement in function in patients with hip OA; however, this class of drugs is not without risk for serious adverse events including increased gastrointestinal bleeding. There is evidence to support the use of corticosteroid injections in patients with hip OA to provide short-term pain relief, and a recent placebo-controlled trial confirmed corticosteroid injection can be an effective treatment of pain in hip OA, with benefits lasting up to 3 months. Some evidence does suggest some NSAIDs may increase the progression of hip OA by decreasing glycosaminoglycan synthesis; however, further studies are needed.

### Efficacy of platelet-rich plasma versus placebo for the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^91e6ef4c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a painful condition that can impair a patient's quality of life. If nonoperative measures fail, progressively more invasive treatment options may be required. This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma (LR-PRP) injections in the treatment of refractory GTPS caused by bursitis and/or gluteal tendinopathy.

Methods

An ethically approved, adequately powered, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes in randomized LR-PRP and placebo groups using the International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, the modified Harris hip score (mHHS), the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and the presence or absence of complications. All injections were performed under ultrasound guidance into the trochanteric bursa and gluteus medius tendon.

Results

The final analysis included 79 patients (39 in the LR-PRP and 40 in the placebo group; 73 female and 6 male; all Caucasian). Both the LR-PRP and the placebo group generally had improvement from baseline that was maintained to 12 months. The only deterioration in scores compared to baseline was seen in the LR-PRP group for the iHOT-12 at 12 months, the EQ-5D index at 3 and 6 months, and the EQ-5D VAS at all follow-up time points. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at any follow-up point (p > 0.05). A multivariable linear regression model, with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and preoperative baseline score, did not reveal any significant associations between iHOT-12 and EQ-5D score gains at 12 months and treatment.

Conclusions

This randomized trial found no significant difference in outcomes between LR-PRP and placebo for the treatment of greater trochanteric pain up to 6 months following the intervention. As a result, we do not support the routine use of PRP for the treatment of this condition.

Preoperative intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)/surgical site infection risk around knee and hip arthroplasty are time dependent. For total knee arthroplasty (TKR), studies reported increased risk for injections done in a 6-month window preceding TKR with no detectable increased risk after 6 months, increased incidence when steroids were injected within 3 months, and, in a study of 76 090 patients, significantly increased risk for the 0–2-week window with a trend for increased risk within 2–4 weeks; another analysis of 9766 patients (4766 had IACS, 5000 without injection) found significant risk when IACS was done within 4 weeks prior to the TKA with no infection risk when the interval was beyond 4 weeks. For total hip replacement (THR), two large administrative analyses found that IACS within the 3 months of THR resulted in higher rates of PJI with no increased infection risk for IACS given between 3 and 6 months or between 6 and 12 months, and a 2023 review and meta-analysis concluded that the risk of infection is increased when an IACS is performed within 3 months of THR; across multivariate analyses, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory arthritis, or RA all carried significant risk of PJI, and guidance notes that providing IACS during the 3-month pre-operative period may carry increased risk of PJI, especially if done within 2–4 weeks of TKR.

### Trochanteric bursitis following primary total hip arthroplasty: incidence, predictors, and treatment [^c5d60ea4]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Trochanteric bursitis (TB) remains a common complication after total hip arthroplasty (THA), with an incidence between 3% and 17%, depending on the surgical approach, with the posterior approach (PA) being relatively protective compared to the lateral approach. The purposes of this study were to determine the incidence of TB after primary THA, identify potential risk factors for TB, and examine the utility of different modes of treatment.

Methods

Retrospective cohort data of 990 primary THAs performed in a single institution, including 613 PAs and 377 direct anterior approaches (DAAs), were analyzed. Data abstracted included demographic data, operative diagnosis, comorbidities, radiographic assessment, and other specific predictors of interest that were compared between patients diagnosed with TB following THA and controls.

Results

The incidence of TB following primary THA was 5.4% (54/990) for the entire cohort. The incidence did not differ significantly between the PA and DAA (5% vs 6.1%, respectively; P = 0.47). Charlson comorbidity index and American Society of Anesthesiology did not differ significantly in the TB group. Lumbar spinal stenosis and history of past smoking were significantly more common in patients who developed TB (P = 0.03, P = 0.01, respectively), but did not continue to be significant risk factors on multivariate analysis. All patients were treated nonoperatively by the time of final follow-up. Seventy-four percent required a local steroid injection and 30% required treatment with more than one modality.

Conclusion

The occurrence of TB is not influenced by the surgical approach (PA or DAA), and could not be predicted by specific comorbidities or radiographic measurements. However, it can be effectively treated conservatively in most cases.

### Landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided approaches for trochanteric bursa injection: a cadaveric study [^14528fe8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Trochanteric bursa (TB) injection with local anesthetic and corticosteroid is a treatment for patients suffering from greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Both landmark (LM)-guided and ultrasound (US)-guided methods have been used, but their accuracies have not been determined. This study examined the accuracy of these injections with cadaveric dissection.

Methods

Twenty-four hip specimens were randomized to receive TB injections with methylene blue under either LM-guided or US-guided approach. After dissection, the locations of the dye were classified into 3 categories: intrabursal, extrabursal, or combined intrabursal and extrabursal. The presence of dye in the intrabursal space with or without extrabursal leak was considered a successful injection. Accuracy was defined as the percentage of successful injection.

Results

The accuracies of the LM-guided and US-guided injection were 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.35–0.90) and 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.62–1.00), respectively, with no significant difference.

Conclusions

This is the first cadaveric study examining the accuracy of both the US-guided and LM-guided techniques for TB injection. Future clinical studies are required to compare the outcomes of LM-guided and US-guided greater trochanteric pain syndrome injection.

### Intraarticular corticosteroid injection: pain relief in osteoarthritis of the hip? [^03317d81]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the elderly population, and surgery is often preceded by years of pain and disability. Intraarticular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritic joints may play a role in the therapeutic plan and can afford quick pain relief but do not alter the underlying disease. There is a paucity of well controlled studies that provide recommendations for the use of corticosteroids in OA of the hip.

Methods

A prospective analysis of 80 patients with OA of the hip and pain at rest and on bearing weight for more than 4 weeks was performed. Patients were randomized into 2 groups; group 1 (n = 40) received corticosteroid (80 mg triamcinolone acetonide) and group 2 (n = 40) local anesthetic (1% mepivacaine), injected into the hip joint under fluoroscopy. Pain, functional ability, range of motion of the joint, and analgesics consumed were registered 3 weeks postinjection. The treatment was blind for the patients and the investigators performing the followup.

Results

Pain for all modalities decreased after corticosteroid injection, but pain at rest decreased the most. There was significant pain reduction at the 3 (and 12) week followup. Joint range of motion increased significantly for all directions. Functional ability improved significantly after injection. We found no significant pain relief or improvement of functional ability in patients treated with local anesthetics.

Conclusion

This study suggests that intraarticular corticosteroids might improve pain and range of motion of the affected joint in patients with hip OA.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^ae37d4a3]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.
