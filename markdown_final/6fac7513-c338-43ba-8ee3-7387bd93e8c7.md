## Question

Is MRI ordered in speech impairment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when MRI is indicated in the evaluation of speech impairment and how to structure that decision clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic categories of speech impairment and how that drives imaging. Then, I should verify guideline-based rules for when MRI is not indicated versus when it is recommended. Next, I will examine special populations where MRI meaningfully changes management. After that, I need to check practical implementation details like age, sedation, and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a decision algorithm and ensure it aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical categories because imaging indications hinge on etiology. Speech impairment spans structural/mechanical disorders of the larynx and velopharynx, neurogenic motor speech disorders such as dysarthria and apraxia of speech, and cognitive-linguistic disorders including primary progressive aphasia and other dementias, with developmental and genetic etiologies also in scope, so I need to keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^112Pg3sN] [^1173jJNL] [^1152M3WF].

> Now, I should verify the rule for primary voice complaints before jumping to imaging. The AAO-HNS hoarseness guideline is explicit that clinicians should not obtain CT or MRI prior to visualizing the larynx, so laryngoscopy comes first and imaging is reserved for specific findings thereafter, which I should not overlook [^112p7mrV] [^115oJU2t]. Wait, let me verify the exceptions: imaging is appropriate after laryngoscopy if there is vocal fold paralysis or a mass/lesion, aligning with primary care guidance to image only when laryngoscopy reveals these entities, so I need to ensure laryngeal visualization precedes any MRI order [^115H6ncR].

> Next, I will examine velopharyngeal dysfunction, because this is where MRI can be uniquely informative. MRI provides direct, radiation-free visualization of velar and pharyngeal musculature and can capture dynamic function during speech, which neither nasendoscopy nor videofluoroscopy fully achieves, so for surgical planning in VPD/VPI, MRI is increasingly used and often preferred in children who can cooperate, particularly when syndromic features complicate nasendoscopy [^112wPzKm] [^116isT13] [^112h7EgN]. Hold on, I should verify age and feasibility: nonsedated protocols work best from about age 4 and older, with prescan training and audiovisual cues improving success, and syndromic children can still complete scans effectively with preparation, which supports MRI as a practical alternative in this population [^115W9Rfb] [^111P66sF] [^115nz1NG].

> I will now consider neurogenic motor speech disorders. For progressive apraxia of speech, MRI is part of the standard workup to characterize atrophy patterns and exclude alternate pathology, and serial MRI can quantify precentral/supplementary motor area atrophy as sensitive outcome measures for trials, so I should not delay neuroimaging in suspected neurodegenerative AOS [^113CXCTD] [^112J1DZB]. But wait, what if the MRI is normal in idiopathic childhood apraxia of speech? That happens frequently, yet diffusion MRI may reveal connectivity differences, so a normal structural MRI does not exclude CAS and should not stop clinical diagnosis or therapy, which I need to make clear to avoid false reassurance [^notfound].

> For cognitive-linguistic syndromes, I should confirm that structural brain imaging is a tier-1 test. The Alzheimer's Association recommends MRI without contrast as standard in the evaluation of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders to exclude treatable causes and define vascular contributions, and this extends to atypical presentations with language or speech predominance where MRI helps subtype primary progressive aphasia and guide management, so MRI is indicated here rather than exceptional [^115mtTcN] [^11156Sez]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, CT is acceptable, but MRI is preferred for soft-tissue detail and vascular patterns, which matters for etiologic clarity in PPA and related dementias [^115mtTcN].

> Let me think about developmental and genetic etiologies. In children with global developmental delay or intellectual disability, guidelines support brain MRI when history or examination suggests neurologic abnormalities, and emerging genetic syndromes such as USP7-related disorder and others frequently show characteristic MRI features, so MRI can be both diagnostic and prognostically informative in selected cases of unexplained speech delay within a broader neurodevelopmental context [^1175Y3zw] [^111YJn3B] [^1122iUxS]. I should double-check that routine MRI is not advised for all isolated speech delays; yield is low without red flags, so clinical judgment and exam findings should drive imaging in this group [^116FDY25].

> Next, I should review special populations where MRI meaningfully alters management. In sudden sensorineural hearing loss, MRI or ABR is recommended to evaluate for retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma, and this matters because retrocochlear disease can present with speech perception problems and early detection changes outcomes, so MRI is indicated in SSNHL even when speech is the more prominent complaint [^114jMDTn]. For unilateral tinnitus without other red flags, ACR suggests MRI to evaluate for retrocochlear lesions, which again can intersect with speech concerns in select patients, so I need to align imaging with otologic indications rather than speech alone [^113qXRTA].

> I need to ensure practical implementation details are addressed. For pediatric velopharyngeal MRI, success improves with age 4 and older, structured caregiver-child training, and in-scanner task coaching, reducing the need for sedation; however, sedation remains necessary for younger or uncooperative children, and anesthesia planning in the MRI suite requires attention to airway access and monitoring constraints, so I should coordinate with radiology and anesthesia early when sedation is anticipated [^115W9Rfb] [^111P66sF] [^11231yfR]. Safety screening for implants, claustrophobia, and motion tolerance should precede scheduling, and I should verify device compatibility, especially for cochlear implants where manufacturer-specific MRI protocols exist, to avoid delays or complications [^113S2eNu].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. If the presentation is a primary voice complaint, I should not order MRI before laryngoscopy; after visualization, MRI is appropriate for vocal fold paralysis or a mass, whereas isolated dysphonia without structural findings does not warrant MRI, which aligns with AAO-HNS and primary care guidance [^112p7mrV] [^115oJU2t] [^115H6ncR]. If the presentation is velopharyngeal dysfunction, MRI is reasonable when detailed muscular anatomy and dynamic function will change surgical planning or when nasendoscopy is not feasible, particularly in children aged 4 years and older who can cooperate, with prescan preparation to optimize quality [^112wPzKm] [^115W9Rfb]. If the presentation is a neurogenic motor speech disorder or cognitive-linguistic syndrome, MRI is indicated to characterize neurodegeneration, exclude alternate causes, and support subtype diagnosis, with diffusion or volumetric metrics adding value in research and clinical trials contexts [^113CXCTD] [^115mtTcN] [^11156Sez]. If the presentation is developmental speech delay, MRI is not routine but should be considered when accompanied by abnormal neurologic findings, global developmental delay, or syndromic features suggesting a structural brain disorder, consistent with neurodevelopmental guidelines [^1175Y3zw].

> Finally, I should confirm that MRI complements rather than replaces clinical speech-language assessment. Across these scenarios, speech-language pathology evaluation remains foundational, and MRI serves to clarify anatomy, exclude disease, and refine etiologic diagnosis when the clinical picture warrants it, which is the most evidence-aligned and cost-conscious approach to imaging in speech impairment [^113jdYi9] [^115mtTcN] [^116isT13].

MRI is **not routinely ordered** for speech impairment; it is reserved for cases with **red flags** such as focal deficits, progressive course, or suspected neurodegenerative, structural, or genetic etiologies [^1175Y3zw] [^116FDY25]. MRI is indicated when **clinical evaluation suggests** a structural brain lesion, neurodegenerative disease, or a genetic syndrome with brain anomalies, and is particularly useful for velopharyngeal dysfunction, childhood apraxia of speech, and progressive aphasias [^112wPzKm] [^notfound] [^11156Sez]. Routine MRI is not recommended for isolated developmental speech delay without neurological signs or regression [^1175Y3zw] [^116FDY25].

---

## Indications for MRI in speech impairment

MRI is **indicated** in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Structural brain lesions**: Suspected tumors, strokes, or other focal lesions affecting speech production or language areas [^1123gkaV].

- **Neurodegenerative diseases**: Progressive speech disorders such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA) or progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) [^11156Sez] [^112J1DZB].

- **Genetic syndromes**: Suspected genetic disorders with associated brain anomalies (e.g. FOXP2-related speech disorders, USP7-related neurodevelopmental disorder) [^116ZVmfm] [^111YJn3B].

- **Velopharyngeal dysfunction**: Detailed assessment of velopharyngeal structures and function during speech production [^112wPzKm] [^116isT13].

- **Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS)**: Suspected neurological basis for speech motor planning deficits [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on when MRI should be considered in patients with speech impairment:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mri recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Isolated developmental speech delay without neurological signs | No | Routine MRI not indicated; low yield [^116FDY25] |
| Progressive speech disorder (e.g. PPA, PAOS) | Yes | MRI essential for diagnosis, differentiation, and monitoring [^11156Sez] [^112J1DZB] |
| Suspected structural brain lesion (e.g. tumor, stroke) | Yes | MRI necessary to identify and localize lesions [^1123gkaV] |
| Suspected genetic syndrome with brain anomalies | Yes | MRI to identify characteristic brain abnormalities [^111YJn3B] [^116ZVmfm] |
| Velopharyngeal dysfunction | Yes | MRI provides detailed anatomical and functional assessment [^112wPzKm] [^116isT13] |
| Childhood apraxia of speech | Yes (selective) | MRI indicated when neurological basis suspected [^1175Y3zw] |

## Benefits and limitations of MRI in speech impairment

MRI offers **several advantages** over other imaging modalities, including:

- **High-resolution soft tissue imaging**: Detailed visualization of brain structures involved in speech and language production [^116isT13].

- **Functional MRI (fMRI)**: Assessment of brain activity during speech tasks, providing insights into functional organization and plasticity [^112oZ7Nw].

- **Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)**: Evaluation of white matter tracts and connectivity patterns relevant to speech and language [^113FF7fu].

However, MRI also has **limitations**, including:

- **Cost and availability**: MRI is expensive and may not be readily available in all healthcare settings [^112kUP35].

- **Patient cooperation**: MRI requires patient stillness, which can be challenging for young children or individuals with cognitive impairments [^115W9Rfb].

- **Contraindications**: Certain medical conditions (e.g. pacemakers, metal implants) may preclude MRI [^113CXCTD].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

When MRI is not indicated or feasible, **alternative diagnostic methods** include:

- **Clinical speech-language assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation by speech-language pathologists to assess speech production, language abilities, and cognitive-communication skills [^113jdYi9].

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Useful in cases of suspected epilepsy-related speech impairment [^1175Y3zw].

- **Genetic testing**: Identification of genetic mutations associated with speech and language disorders [^111YJn3B].

---

## Conclusion

MRI is **not routinely ordered** for speech impairment but is valuable in specific clinical scenarios, such as progressive speech disorders, suspected structural brain lesions, genetic syndromes, velopharyngeal dysfunction, and childhood apraxia of speech. Clinical guidelines emphasize selective use of MRI, balancing its benefits with practical limitations. Alternative diagnostic methods should be considered when MRI is not indicated or feasible.

The presence of a concomitant syndromic diagnosis did not significantly affect quality or success for participating in a VP MRI protocol. However, the presence of a syndromic condition has the potential to introduce unique considerations and complexities, depending on the diagnosis at hand. Therefore, many imaging studies have excluded children with syndromic conditions.– However, concomitant syndromic diagnoses are a frequent occurrence in children with cleft conditions, particularly those with noncleft VP dysfunction, warranting their inclusion, rather than exclusion, for comprehensive speech/resonance assessment. Given that syndromic conditions are often associated with communication difficulties, such as speech and language impairment, coordinating speech tasks during the MRI scan may require specialized communication strategies or adaptations to ensure successful data collection for this population of patients. This highlights the benefit of including an SLP in the protocol procedures and data analyses.

Customization of the protocol to accommodate the needs associated with syndromic diagnoses may further ensure the collection of valuable imaging data. In addition, certain syndromes may present safety concerns in the MRI environment. For example, patients with implanted medical devices may require specialized safety assessments to confirm compatibility with MRI. – This requires close coordination among health care professionals and a patient-centered approach to care.

### Diagnostic methods and recommendations for the cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes [^111oJH7T]. Pediatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Primary care pediatricians and a variety of specialist physicians strive to define an accurate diagnosis for children presenting with impairment of expressive speech and delay in achieving developmental milestones. Within the past two decades, a group of disorders featuring this presentation have been identified as cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS). Patients with these disorders were initially discerned using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. The objective of this review is to provide the clinician with an overview of the current information available on identifying and treating these conditions. We explain the salient features of creatine metabolism, synthesis, and transport required for normal development. We propose diagnostic approaches for confirming a CCDS diagnosis. Finally, we describe treatment approaches for managing patients with these conditions.

### Diagnostic distortions: a case report of progressive apraxia of speech [^1168ajjs]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Apraxia of speech (AOS) can be the presenting symptom of neurodegenerative disease. The position of primary progressive AOS in the nosology of the dementias is still controversial. Despite seeing many specialists, patients are often misdiagnosed, in part due to a lack of quantitative measures of speech dysfunction. We present a single case report of a patient presenting with AOS, including acoustic analysis, language assessment, and brain imaging. A 52-year-old woman presenting with AOS had remained undiagnosed for 6 years despite seeing 8 specialists. Results of her MRI scans, genetic testing, and computerized speech analysis are provided. AOS is an underdiagnosed clinical syndrome causing great distress to patients and families. Using acoustic analysis of speech may lead to improved diagnostic accuracy. AOS is a complex entity with an expanding phenotype, and quantitative clinical measures will be critical for detection and to assess progression.

### Complications of cochlear implants with MRI scans in different body regions: type, frequency and impact [^113S2eNu]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the last years, cochlear implants (CI) have been increasingly used for the treatment of patients of all ages with severe sensorineural hearing loss. The worldwide implementation of screening programs for newborns will effectively shift the time of diagnosis and of CI application to younger ages. At the same time, the number of implantations will also increase in elderly patients considering a broader spectrum of indications and a higher life expectancy. In 2019, the United States National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has estimated a number of nearly 740,000 registered devices implanted worldwide. For the United States alone, this amounted to 118,000 and 65,000 devices for adults and children, respectively.

With rising numbers of MR scans and CI implantations per year, radiologists are confronted with an increasing number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in CI patients of all ages. Inpatient utilization of MRI procedures in Germany went from about 1.0 million per year in 2005 to about 1.5 millions in 2010 and has reached nearly 1.9 millions in 2020. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally characterized by an excellent soft-tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. It sees a growing use for many clinical questions but has strict limitations for devices with electrical or magnetic components. Following extensive experimental testing, each manufacturer issues a specific guideline on how to perform a corresponding MRI procedure safely. Considering the differences between experimental and clinical settings, it is therefore crucial to also report and categorize the actual complications seen for routine MRI examinations.

The aim of this work is to assess the type and frequency of MRI-related complications in patients with cochlear implants at a single academic institution, a tertiary care hospital.

### MRI assessment of velopharyngeal dysfunction: a comprehensive primer for radiologists [^112wPzKm]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is a condition where the velopharyngeal mechanism fails to close properly, resulting in nasal air escape during speech and hypernasal resonance. VPD is common in patients with cleft palate and presents significant challenges, often necessitating advanced imaging techniques for surgical treatment planning. Recent advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enhanced the capability to obtain detailed static images of velopharyngeal structures at rest and during sustained phonation, which are comparable or superior to traditional technologies. MRI is particularly effective at assessing the levator veli palatini muscle, a critical component of the velopharyngeal mechanism. As a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method with high-resolution capabilities, MRI is becoming increasingly popular for VPD evaluation, especially in the pediatric population. However, understanding the complexities of VPD requires specialized knowledge spanning craniofacial surgery and speech-language pathology, which is often inaccessible in the radiology literature. While technical guides on MRI protocols for VPD exist, foundational knowledge of the velopharyngeal mechanism and its relevance to cleft anatomy remains underrepresented. This primer aims to bridge the gap between radiology and the complex multidisciplinary care of VPD by equipping radiologists with the knowledge necessary to effectively interpret MRI findings and integrate them into diagnostic and therapeutic pathways. By reviewing velopharyngeal and cleft anatomy, relevant VPD terminology, the principles of surgical management, and the role of MRI in velopharyngeal assessment, this paper provides radiologists with the context and tools to collaborate and communicate more effectively with cleft and craniofacial teams that treat this condition.

### Achieving clinical success in nonsedated velopharyngeal magnetic resonance imaging: optimizing data quality and patient selection [^115W9Rfb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Ideal Patient Population

The findings highlight that the ideal patient population for this MRI protocol comprises pediatric patients, age 4 or older, who present with suspected or known VP abnormalities or disorders (Fig. 4). This ideal population should include children who require noninvasive imaging for evaluation of the VP mechanism, including the assessment of anatomic structures and function during phonation. This age group ensures that children are old enough to comprehend and follow instructions during the procedure, eliminating any need for sedation. Increased variability in success of the procedure was demonstrated in children younger than 4 years. Thus, the age of 4 appears to be a critical threshold for success for nonsedated imaging, based on data from this study as well as data from a number of studies assessed by a review of the extant literature. Findings illustrate that ideal candidates should have the cognitive and behavioral capacity to follow verbal instructions, regardless of concomitant diagnoses, consistent with work by Thieba et al. Children should be able to understand the importance of maintaining stillness during image acquisition and actively participate in speech tasks during the scan.

Fig. 4.
Characteristics of ideal candidates for nonsedated VP MRI who are likely to achieve successful outcomes with high-quality images.

When considering other existing clinical imaging modalities for assessment, such as nasendoscopy, MRI may prove to be a more accessible and successful technique for children with concomitant syndromic diagnoses. Added challenges are often present for this population that can prohibit reliable and complete data collection during nasendoscopy due to the invasive nature of the nasendoscopy procedure. In contrast, with adequate preparation before scanning, this was not the case for VP MRI, highlighting the added benefit of utilizing MRI to assess the VP mechanism in children with concomitant syndromic diagnoses. As previously noted, patients should meet all safety criteria for MRI, including the absence of contraindications such as certain metallic implants or medical conditions that could pose risks in the MRI environment.

Finally, it is important to note that patient selection should be based on the specific objectives for clinical evaluation. Instances may arise where differing modalities may be more beneficial or a combination of modalities may be warranted. In addition, although the MRI protocol is designed to be well tolerated by pediatric patients, individual patient characteristics, as noted by these study findings, and clinical considerations should guide the decision to use this imaging approach for assessing VP function. Opportunities also exist to develop additional tools for improving outcomes of VP MRI protocols in the 2- to 4-year age range.

### Towards the routine use of brain imaging to aid the clinical diagnosis of disorders of consciousness [^112oZ7Nw]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical audits have highlighted the many challenges and dilemmas faced by clinicians assessing persons with disorders of consciousness (vegetative state and minimally conscious state). The diagnostic decision-making process is highly subjective, dependent upon the skills of the examiner and invariably dictated by the patients' ability to move or speak. Whilst a considerable amount has been learnt since Jennett and Plum coined the term 'vegetative state', the assessment process remains largely unchanged; conducted at the bedside, using behavioural assessment tools, which are susceptible to environmental and physiological factors. This has created a situation where the rate of misdiagnosis is unacceptably high (up to 43%). In order to address these problems, various functional brain imaging paradigms, which do not rely upon the patient's ability to move or speak, have been proposed as a source of additional information to inform the diagnostic decision making process. Although accumulated evidence from brain imaging, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has been encouraging, the empirical evidence is still based on relatively small numbers of patients. It remains unclear whether brain imaging is capable of informing the diagnosis beyond the behavioural assessment and whether brain imaging has any prognostic utility. In this study, we describe the functional brain imaging findings from a group of 41 patients with disorders of consciousness, who undertook a hierarchical speech processing task. We found, contrary to the clinical impression of a specialist team using behavioural assessment tools, that two patients referred to the study with a diagnosis of vegetative state did in fact demonstrate neural correlates of speech comprehension when assessed using functional brain imaging. These fMRI findings were found to have no association with the patient's behavioural presentation at the time of investigation and thus provided additional diagnostic information beyond the traditional clinical assessment. Notably, the utility of brain imaging was further underlined by the finding that the level of auditory processing revealed by functional brain imaging, correlated strongly (rs = 0.81, P < 0.001) with the patient's subsequent behavioural recovery, 6 months after the scan, suggesting that brain imaging may also provide valuable prognostic information. Although further evidence is required before consensus statements can be made regarding the use of brain imaging in clinical decision making for disorders of consciousness, the results from this study clearly highlight the potential of imaging to inform the diagnostic decision-making process for persons with disorders of consciousness.

### Applying recommendations for diagnostic disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia: practical guidance for clinicians [^114ZW5Zv]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinician should then probe further, assessing patient and care partner understanding and appreciation of the presence and severity of cognitive impairment and its possible etiologies. Patients could be asked to describe a typical day in their life. The clinician would then ask a follow‐up question such as: "Have you ever had difficulty going about those activities you described because of cognitive changes?" Comparing the patient and care partner's responses to this question will provide insight into differences between patient and care partner perceptions. Clinicians should also assess knowledge of and concern about likely etiologies of symptoms. For example, if patients or their care partner is concerned about a cognitive change, the clinician might say, "It sounds like you have noticed a definite change in your memory and thinking. What do you think might be causing this? Is there a particular condition you are worried about?"

Discussions around any referral (eg, for neuropsychological evaluation) or testing (eg, neuroimaging) provide additional opportunities to assess patient understanding and appreciation. A clinician can explore the patient's or care partner's desire for information about the cause of the cognitive problems. A clinician might approach this by saying, "Today you told me that you are having trouble with your short‐term memory. Based on your exam, I agree, there are changes in your memory that are beyond what we would expect for your age. I typically recommend a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain to look for causes of memory change. Is this something you would like to do?"

In the ideal circumstance, an affirmative response from both patient and care partner further supports a process that will end with diagnostic disclosure. By reiterating to the patient and care partner the reasons a test is being ordered – using the patient's or care partner's own words from the discussion of the chief complaint or reasons for the evaluation – the clinician fosters a collective understanding of the problem and describes the steps being taken to address it.

### The pediatric neuroradiologist's practical guide to capture and evaluate pre-and postoperative velopharyngeal insufficiency [^116isT13]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Up to 30% of children with cleft palate will develop a severe speech disorder known as velopharyngeal insufficiency. Management of velopharyngeal insufficiency typically involves structural and functional assessment of the velum and pharynx by endoscopy and/or videofluoroscopy. These methods cannot provide direct evaluation of underlying velopharyngeal musculature. MR imaging offers an ideal imaging method, providing noninvasive, high-contrast, high-resolution imaging of soft-tissue anatomy. Furthermore, focused-speech MR imaging techniques can evaluate the function of the velum and pharynx during sustained speech production, providing critical physiologic information that supplements anatomic findings. The use of MR imaging for velopharyngeal evaluation is relatively novel, with limited literature describing its use in clinical radiology. Here we provide a practical approach to perform and interpret velopharyngeal MR imaging examinations. This article discusses the velopharyngeal MR imaging protocol, methods for interpreting velopharyngeal anatomy, and examples illustrating its clinical applications. This knowledge will provide radiologists with a new, noninvasive tool to offer to referring specialists.

### Establishing a clinical protocol for velopharyngeal MRI and interpreting imaging findings [^112h7EgN]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Traditional imaging modalities used to assess velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) do not allow for direct visualization of underlying velopharyngeal (VP) structures and musculature which could impact surgical planning. This limitation can be overcome via structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the only current imaging tool that provides direct visualization of salient VP structures. MRI has been used extensively in research; however, it has had limited clinical use. Factors that restrict clinical use of VP MRI include limited access to optimized VP MRI protocols and uncertainty regarding how to interpret VP MRI findings. The purpose of this paper is to outline a framework for establishing a novel VP MRI scan protocol and to detail the process of interpreting scans of the velopharynx at rest and during speech tasks. Additionally, this paper includes common scan parameters needed to allow for visualization of velopharynx and techniques for the elicitation of speech during scans.

### Efficacy of a selective imaging paradigm prior to pediatric cochlear implantation [^114RzfXH]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

There is no consensus on the necessary preoperative imaging in children being evaluated for cochlear implantation (CI). Dual-imaging protocols that implement both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) create diagnostic redundancy in the face of potentially unnecessary radiation and anaesthetic exposure. The objectives of the current study were to examine the efficacy of an MRI-predominant with selective HRCT imaging protocol.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Methods

The protocol was implemented over a 4-year period, during which HRCT was obtained in addition to MRI only if specific risk factors on clinical assessment were identified or if imaging findings in need of further evaluation were detected on initial MRI evaluation. Retrospective review of operative reports and prospective review of imaging were performed; anesthetic exposure and costing information were also obtained.

Results

Of the 240 patients who underwent assessment, seven (2.9%) had combined HRCT and MRI performed concurrently based on initial clinical assessment, 15 (6.3%) underwent HRCT based on imaging anomalies found on MRI, and MRI alone was ordered for the remaining 218 (90.1%). All patients were implanted without complication. Overall, radiation exposure, general anesthesia (GA), and healthcare costs were reduced.

Conclusions

MRI alone can be used in the vast majority of cases for preoperative evaluation of pediatric CI candidates resulting in a significant reduction in healthcare costs, radiation, and GA exposure in children. The additional need for HRCT occurs in a small proportion and can be predicted up front on clinical assessment or on initial MRI.

### When the word doesn' T come out: a synthetic overview of dysarthria [^112Pg3sN]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Motor speech disorders are common in a number of neurological conditions including diseases involving impairment of the pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar pathways, cranial nerves, muscular apparatus, neuromuscular plaque, and of cognitive, symbolic and mnestic activities. The diagnosis of speech disorders, namely the dysarthrias, involves the assessment of characteristic structural cerebral, prosodic, phonetic and phonemic changes, often flanked by concomitant functional, clinical, neuroradiological, neurophysiological and behavioral impairment. This paper presents a brief outline of the most significant associations to facilitate prompt differential diagnosis and thereby reduce the number of instrumental examinations required for diagnostic testing.

### Ethical considerations in functional magnetic resonance imaging research in acutely comatose patients [^111sHWmj]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Functional MRI research

Functional MRI is a promising experimental diagnostic and prognostic modality in patients who have suffered severe brain injuries. Functional MRI has been used to map resting state networks and residual cognitive function in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness, including minimally conscious and vegetative patients. In one study, 17% of patients diagnosed as vegetative were found to be covertly aware. In addition to diagnostic information, functional MRI may also provide useful prognostic information.used a hierarchical speech processing task in 41 patients with disorders of consciousness 2 to 108 months post injury. The level of speech and semantic processing revealed on functional MRI was strongly correlated with behavioural recovery 6 months after the scan. However, functional MRI has only been used infrequently in the context of acute coma. Functional MRI is difficult to perform in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated and may be medically unstable and, as a result, few research teams have the necessary experience to use this technique effectively.

Conceptually, functional MRI could be used in three different ways to assess acutely comatose patients (or, the broader group of patients with acute impairment of consciousness after brain injury). First, resting state functional MRI can be used to assess functional interactions between different brain regions when a patient is not exposed to any particular stimulus, nor asked to perform any specific task. Second, cognitive functions that do not require consciousness, such as sound processing, visual processing, speech recognition and semantic processing, can be assessed by passive paradigms that do not require the cooperation of the patient. Third, cognitive functions that do require consciousness, such as memory, executive function, and command following, may be assessed by active paradigms requiring patient cooperation. A central hypothesis of functional MRI research in acutely comatose patients is that evidence of preserved neural connectivity and cognitive function will predict neurological recovery.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^115mtTcN]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 9 — structural brain imaging in cognitive–behavioral syndromes — states that the clinician should obtain structural brain imaging to aid in establishing the cause(s), and if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available or is contraindicated, computed tomography (CT) should be obtained (Strength of Recommendation A). As part of Tier 1 testing for etiological diagnosis, structural brain imaging should be obtained in almost all patients; when available, brain MRI without contrast provides standard of care for individuals without contraindication — a head CT should be considered in others. Structural brain imaging is useful to exclude non-AD/ADRD-related conditions, can identify tumors or other lesions, and particularly MRI is often very helpful for determining the potential contribution of VCID, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy. An individualized risk–benefit calculus should guide the type and timing of neuroimaging, and obtaining neuroimaging in a bed-bound and non-communicative individual with longstanding and very severe dementia should be avoided. Cerebral atrophy, leukoaraiosis, or microhemorrhage should not be routinely interpreted as "age related" in a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, and the extent and pattern should be clearly delineated and clinical correlation should be advised.

Speech and language

Recommendation #15 (++)

All children with CG should be screened for speech and language delay at ages 7–12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years (consider combining with screening for cognitive disorders, recommendation #12). If children show low or borderline speech and language development, full assessments should be conducted.

Recommendation #16 (expert opinion, +)

We recommend that an assessment of speech and language includes hearing screening, a brief assessment of pre-linguistic communication (< 2 years of age) and expressive, receptive, and pragmatic language use, structure-function examination, motor speech (observation of respiration, resonance, voice, articulation), and speech intelligibility for all children not meeting age appropriate milestones. We recommend a cognitive evaluation, as well if, a disorder is suspected.

Recommendation #17 (expert opinion, +)

For children who are not meeting age appropriate speech or language milestones, we recommend treatment based on guidelines for treatment of speech, language, and voice disorders in the general population. Therapy should begin during the first year of life and include modeling and training of gestural communication to increase infant and toddler language development. Play-based milieu for language development is recommended during the second year of life. Individual speech therapy focused on high repetition of a small number of targets should begin during the second year of life and continue as needed throughout the preschool and elementary school years. Respiration, phonation, and resonance deficits should also be addressed.

Neurological complications

Recommendation #18 (++)

Clinicians should screen patients with CG for neurological involvement by clinical examination from the age of 2–3 years. Such screening should include examination for ataxia, tremor, dysmetria, and dystonia. If a specific neurological deficit is noted, monitoring of progression with a designated scale is advised. It is suggested to screen adult patients annually and to record progression, if any. Pediatric patients could be screened more frequently (every 6 months) in order to identify potentially modifiable neurological problems.

Recommendation #19 (+)

We recommend asking patients or caregivers about onset of seizure and seizure-like activity since previous examination and perform an EEG, if indicated.

Recommendation #20 (expert opinion, +)

We do not recommend routine brain and spinal cord imaging in the follow-up of patients with CG.

In those patients with significant or progressive neurological symptoms and signs, imaging may be warranted to (1) determine if a second condition is present or (2) further define the development and progression of neuroradiology findings in individual patients.

### Encoding of human action in broca's area [^117XL9UK]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Broca's area has been considered, for over a century, as the brain centre responsible for speech production. Modern neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence have suggested a wider functional role is played by this area. In addition to the evidence that it is involved in syntactical analysis, mathematical calculation and music processing, it has recently been shown that Broca's area may play some role in language comprehension and, more generally, in understanding actions of other individuals. As shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging, Broca's area is one of the cortical areas activated by hand/mouth action observation and it has been proposed that it may form a crucial node of a human mirror-neuron system. If, on the one hand, neuroimaging studies use a correlational approach which cannot offer a final proof for such claims, available neuropsychological data fail to offer a conclusive demonstration for two main reasons: (i) they use tasks taxing both language and action systems; and (ii) they rarely consider the possibility that Broca's aphasics may also be affected by some form of apraxia. We administered a novel action comprehension test — with almost no linguistic requirements — on selected frontal aphasic patients lacking apraxic symptoms. Patients, as well as matched controls, were shown short movies of human actions or of physical events. Their task consisted of ordering, in a temporal sequence, four pictures taken from each movie and randomly presented on the computer screen. Patient's performance showed a specific dissociation in their ability to re-order pictures of human actions (impaired) with respect to physical events (spared). Our study provides a demonstration that frontal aphasics, not affected by apraxia, are specifically impaired in their capability to correctly encode observed human actions.

### An explainable machine learning model of cognitive decline derived from speech [^112kUP35]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Early detection of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders is urgently needed, with an estimated 153 million people worldwide affected by 2050. Techniques requiring skilled medical professionals and well‐resourced centers enable early detection (e.g. positron emission tomography [PET] scans, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] markers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]); however these methods are expensive, rarely available outside of large centers in wealthy countries, and require in‐person attendance. Indeed, expanding access to diagnostics can ensure heightened equity in health care. A low‐cost and remote diagnostic assay based on everyday speech collected over the telephone could provide a highly accessible screening method for neurodegenerative disorders.

Speech expression and content reflect the functioning of numerous cognitive processes including attention and memory. Verbal communication involves various nuanced tasks: the formation of ideas, translation of thoughts into language, and articulation of utterances. Advances in computational linguistics, acoustic processing, and machine learning (ML) enable the assessment of speech in a precise and reproducible manner, that may uncover new mechanistic knowledge regarding cognitive decline. Loss of discourse complexity and connected speech are primary symptoms of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Decreased continuity of acoustic features, greater percentages of voiceless segments, and perturbations in speech amplitude are characteristic of patients diagnosed with AD. There are also differences in features such as pause frequency, duration, and linguistic complexity between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. More recently, the temporal integration of acoustics and language from spontaneous speech has been shown to be predictive of AD.

### Sample size calculations for clinical trials targeting tauopathies: a new potential disease target [^112J1DZB]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Disease-modifying therapies are being developed to target tau pathology, and should, therefore, be tested in primary tauopathies. We propose that progressive apraxia of speech should be considered one such target group. In this study, we investigate potential neuroimaging and clinical outcome measures for progressive apraxia of speech and determine sample size estimates for clinical trials. We prospectively recruited 24 patients with progressive apraxia of speech who underwent two serial MRI with an interval of approximately 2 years. Detailed speech and language assessments included the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale and Motor Speech Disorders severity scale. Rates of ventricular expansion and rates of whole brain, striatal and midbrain atrophy were calculated. Atrophy rates across 38 cortical regions were also calculated and the regions that best differentiated patients from controls were selected. Sample size estimates required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials were calculated. The smallest sample size estimates were obtained with rates of atrophy of the precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area, with both measures requiring less than 50 subjects per arm to detect a 25% treatment effect with 80% power. These measures outperformed the other regional and global MRI measures and the clinical scales. Regional rates of cortical atrophy, therefore, provide the best outcome measures in progressive apraxia of speech. The small sample size estimates demonstrate feasibility for including progressive apraxia of speech in future clinical treatment trials targeting tau.

### Neurological and magnetic resonance imaging findings in children with developmental language impairment [^115xgAFZ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Neurologic and radiologic findings in children with well-defined developmental language impairment have rarely been systematically assessed. Children aged 7 to 13 years with developmental language impairment or normal language (controls) underwent language, nonverbal cognitive, motor and neurological assessments, standardized assessment for subtle neurological signs, and magnetic resonance imaging. Nine children with developmental language impairment and 12 controls participated. No focal abnormalities were identified on standard neurological examination. Age and developmental language impairment were independent predictors of neurological subtle signs scores (r² = 0.52). Imaging abnormalities were identified in two boys with developmental language impairment and no controls (P = 0.17). Lesions identified were predicted neither by history nor by neurological examination. Previously unsuspected lesions were identified in almost 25% of children with developmental language impairment. Constraints regarding cooperation and sedation requirements may limit the clinical application of imaging modalities in this population.

### Achieving clinical success in nonsedated velopharyngeal magnetic resonance imaging: optimizing data quality and patient selection [^115nz1NG]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Variables of Interest

Independent predictor variables of interest included age, sex (male/female), presence of a syndromic condition (yes/no), use of audio/video during scans, and use of preparatory caregiver/child training materials. On the day of the scan, caregivers were asked whether they had viewed the materials and practiced the speech samples with their child. These data were classified as yes/no for analytic purposes.

Dependent variables included scan outcome (successful or failed) and scan quality rating (poor, adequate, good, or excellent). Scan outcome and quality were documented using a systematic stepwise approach (Table 1). A visual representation of adequate and inadequate image capture is provided in Figure 2.

Table 1.
Definitions of Outcome Variables

Fig. 2.
Visual representation of differing image qualities that may affect visualization or quantification of scan data. Structures of interest are readily visualized and quantified across images with adequate data capture. Inadequate data capture, often due to movement artifact or an inability to complete scanning sequences, typically results in images that are unable to be used for accurate quantitative or qualitative assessment. Inadequate data capture is often associated with a failed scan outcome or poor-quality image.

Reliability

Scans were reviewed for quality assessment and rated by 4 individuals, including an SLP with expertise assessing the VP mechanism using MRI, a radiology technologist, and 2 graduate research assistants with training in the area of interest. When reviewing scans for quality assessment, scans were randomized, and all raters were blind to age, diagnosis, and other demographic and potentially predictive variables. Interrater agreement for qualitative outcome ratings was obtained using Fleiss kappa. Strength of rater agreement was very good (κ = 0.824 [CI, 0.757 to 0.891]; P < 0.001) (Table 2). Individual kappa for poor, adequate, good, and excellent quality ratings was 0.942, 0.760, 0.799, 0.791, respectively (Table 3).

### Achieving clinical success in nonsedated velopharyngeal magnetic resonance imaging: optimizing data quality and patient selection [^111P66sF]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Clinical implementation of nonsedated VP MRI is feasible for a broad population of children with VPI, particularly when children are 4 years of age or older. Children with syndromic conditions or developmental delay successfully participated in the protocol when prescan preparations were conducted. Success was greater for children older than 5 years when syndromic diagnoses were present. In general, scanning success increases with increased age, irrespective of concomitant diagnoses. Quality is significantly improved by use of prescan training materials and audiovisual stimuli during scans.

### Aberrant neurophysiological signaling associated with speech impairments in Parkinson's disease [^116ensoL]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, and is characterized by progressive declines in motor function and cognition. Difficulties producing intelligible speech are some of the earliest – and most debilitating, impairments of PD. Speech production is inherently complex, and speech symptoms in patients with PD are multidimensional; they commonly include hoarse voice, imprecise articulation, and monotonous prosody. Alongside reductions in speech volume i.e. hypophonia, these impairments are classically termed hypokinetic dysarthria –. However, the best approach to quantifying pathological changes in speech remains unclear. On the one hand, evaluation of dysarthric symptoms by a certified speech-language pathologist using clinical scales is time-consuming but often regarded as the gold standard. On the other, more rapid and inexpensive assessments based on automatically-extracted acoustical measures, are promising, but may not provide a sufficiently nuanced representation of the disease symptomatology. The optimal outcome of remediation speech therapies in PD is improved intelligibility to human listeners, hence the value of human assessment of speech impairments as an alternative. Human ratings of speech impairments in PD are highly reliable across raters –, time points, and levels of rater expertise, and can contribute to predicting disease progressionand therapeutic outcomesbetter than simpler acoustical metrics.

Beyond the robust quantification of speech impairments in PD, their neurophysiological origins are also unknown. In the healthy brain, speech production engages a distributed and predominantly left-lateralized ensemble of cortical regions including the primary motor, primary auditory, pre-motor, posterior parietal and inferior frontal cortices –. Temporally, cued speech production requires the integration of incoming phonological information in the left superior temporal cortex, followed by engagement of left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) for syllabification and temporal ordering of speech, which then overlaps with sustained motor processing in the precentral gyrus and voluntary control of motor initiation in the left middle and superior frontal cortices, and finally monitoring of auditory feedback in left superior temporal regions. The spectral components of neurophysiological activity related to speech production have also been studied extensively. They include a key role for alpha (~7–13 Hz) and beta (~15–30 Hz) frequency bands in speech-network regions, and slower delta band (~2–4 Hz) activity in prefrontal regions, for effective production of speech –. Interregional beta-band functional connectivity between prefrontal, auditory, and motor cortices is also essential for healthy speech production.

### Screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113S5pWR]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF speech and language delay screening — recommendation and population: For children 5 years or younger without signs or symptoms of speech and language delay and disorders, the USPSTF found that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening; Grade: I statement. This applies to asymptomatic children 5 years or younger whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns, and does not apply to children with another condition that may cause speech or language impairment (eg, autism spectrum disorder). This updated recommendation is consistent with the 2015 USPSTF recommendation on screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children 5 years or younger.

### Pathogenic variants in USP7 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with speech delays, altered behavior, and neurologic anomalies [^111YJn3B]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

While pathogenic variants of USP7 are consistently correlated with white matter and corpus callosum anomalies identified via MRI, along with the physical and behavioral characteristics described above, phenotype-first diagnosis remains unlikely. Ascertainment bias, unstandardized phenotyping, a small sample size, and varying patient ages are limitations for the findings presented here. Furthermore, an individual's age and IQ can affect whether certain potential diagnoses and features are relevant, such as ASD, characteristic behaviors, and hypogonadism. Additionally, while it is plausible that patient 18's USP7 variant led to his white matter and corpus callosum anomalies, the possibility of his TMEM106B variant contributing to these MRI findings should also be considered, given this gene's association with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Whether the variant in TMEM106B acts in conjunction with the loss of USP7 function has yet to be explored. Furthermore, patient 20 harbors an additional de novo pathogenic variant in SLC2A1, associated with several overlapping features including DD/ID, absent speech, seizures, and aggressive behavior, likewise raising the possibility of a dual diagnosis or multiple-variant compound effects.

Proper assessment of patients with complicated neurologic and physiological abnormalities including hypotonia, DD/ID, ASD, hypogonadism, and speech delay can be difficult, considering the phenotypic overlap with other known neurodevelopmental disorders like PWS and SHFYNG. USP7 -associated neurodevelopmental disorder represents a novel genetic syndrome with features similar to both SHFYNG and PWS. Defining features of individuals with pathogenic variants/deletions of USP7 include severe speech delay, unique MRI anomalies, seizures in 48% of individuals, and a lack of high prevalence of the contractures typically observed in SHFYNG. Characteristic MRI findings (e.g. white matter paucity, corpus callosum thinning, etc.) may provide a key piece of evidence to raise clinical suspicion of USP7 -associated neurodevelopmental disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^114jMDTn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — retrocochlear pathology evaluation: Clinicians should evaluate patients with SSNHL for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining an MRI or auditory brainstem response (ABR). Recommendation based on observational studies and a meta-analysis with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B for MRI, Grade C for ABR, based on observational studies and a meta-analysis, and level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefits include identifying vestibular schwannoma or other tumors in the IAC or cerebellopontine angle and identifying conditions that might benefit from early treatment, while risks and costs include procedure specific risks/costs, anxiety, and stress; the benefits-harm assessment was a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note MRI is the most sensitive means for diagnosing retrocochlear pathology, and the panel concluded that ABR (with follow-up MRI if abnormal) would be an acceptable alternative for initial assessment for retrocochlear pathology in SSNHL as long as there is appropriate counseling about the limitations of this modality; patient preferences are small for whether to assess but large for choosing MRI or ABR. MRI of the brain, brainstem, and IACs with gadolinium is the most sensitive test for detecting retrocochlear pathology, ABR alone will miss an average of 20% (range, 0%-42%) of intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas, and contrast-enhanced temporal bone CT scans should be used only in patients who cannot have MRI.

### Responsible development of clinical speech AI: bridging the gap between clinical research and technology [^115Jd4mP]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Speech symptoms are characteristic when damage occurs to any of these (or multiple) neural pathways, although there is symptom overlap and symptoms evolve in presence and severity as the disease progresses. The diagnostic accuracy and test-retest reliability (within and between raters) of dysarthria speech labels from the speech signal alone (i.e. without knowledge of the underlying health condition) is known to be modest, except for expert speech-language pathologists with large and varied neurology caseloads. Diagnosis of the corresponding health conditions relies on a physician's clinical assessment and consideration of other confirmatory information beyond speech. Diagnostic accuracy is impacted by the physician's experience and expertise, whether the symptoms presenting in the condition are textbook or unusual, and whether genetic, imaging, or other laboratory tests provide supporting or confirmatory evidence is available. For example, unilateral vocal fold paralysis is a first-order health condition with direct impact on the speech apparatus (impaired vocal fold vibration) and high-ground truth accuracy and specificity (can be visualized by laryngoscopy). In contrast, Parkinson's disease (PD) has a diffuse impact on the speech apparatus (affecting phonation, articulation, and prosody) which is hard to distinguish from healthy speech or other similar health conditions (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy) in early disease. The reported ground-truth accuracy of the initial clinical diagnosis ranges from 58% to 80%, calling into question clinical labels in early stage PD.

Second-order conditions move away from the speech production mechanism's structure and function and into the cognitive (i.e. memory and language) and perceptual processing domains. These conditions impact the Formulation stage of speaking and manifest as problems finding and sequencing the words to convey one's intended message and may include deficits in speech comprehension. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a second-order condition that deserves particular attention because of the burgeoning efforts in the literature to develop robust supervised classification models. AD disrupts the Formulation stage of speaking with word-finding problems, and the tendency to use simpler and more general semantic and syntactic structures. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been used to characterize these patterns and acoustic analysis has identified speech slowing with greater pausing while speaking, presumably because of decreased efficiency of cognitive processing and early sensorimotor changes.

Patients and methods

Recruitment

Between 1 July 2010 and 31 July 2011 we recruited all patients who presented to the Department of Neurology with a speech and language disorder suspected to be secondary to a degenerative process. Only subjects over the age of 18, with an informant to provide independent evaluation of functioning, and who spoke English as their primary language, were included. All subjects underwent detailed speech and language examination, neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging analysis over a span of 48–72 h. Clinical diagnosis of PPAOS was rendered based solely on data from speech and language assessments without any reference to neurological, neuropsychological or neuroimaging results at a consensus meeting held 1–2 months after enrolment. All subjects had video and audio recordings of their entire comprehensive, formal speech and language assessment, as well as general conversation and performance on a measure of oral praxis.

Diagnosis was made according to operational definitions, after review of the video and audio recordings and review of speech and language test scores as described below. In order to be included in this study all subjects must have been diagnosed with PPAOS; any evidence suggesting aphasia could not be more than equivocal. Dysarthria could be present. Therefore, any subject with even mild (but unequivocal) evidence of aphasia was excluded. Subjects with concurrent illnesses that could account for the speech deficits, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke or developmental syndromes, and subjects meeting criteria for another neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's type dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, probable progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy, or motor neuron degeneration were excluded. Subjects were also excluded if MRI was contraindicated (metal in head, cardiac pace maker, etc.), if there was severe claustrophobia or conditions that might confound brain imaging studies (e.g. structural abnormalities, including subdural haematoma or intracranial neoplasm), or if they were medically unstable or were on medications that might affect brain structure or metabolism, (e.g. chemotherapy).

During this period, 40 subjects were screened of which 37 were recruited and three excluded. One subject was excluded due to a tiny chronic lacunar infarct in the left centrum semiovale and left subinsular white matter, one as a result of having a pacemaker, and one who was determined to meet clinical criteria for Alzheimer's disease.

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board and all subjects consented for enrolment into the study.

### Primary progressive aphasia: six questions in search of an answer [^114zuEyy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Making the diagnosis

Timely diagnosis of PPA resolves uncertainty for patients and families, enables future planning and unlocks access to services and support. The dawning of the age of disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disease, with its imperative to diagnose dementias earlier and more accurately, has only amplified this issue. However, the clinical diagnosis of PPA is often challenging even for those with extensive experience of the syndromes. We present some clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging 'fingerprints' that we have found particularly useful in the early detection of PPA syndromes in Table 1, an approach to bedside syndromic diagnosis in Fig. 1 and an outline of ancillary investigations in Fig. 2.

Table 1
Some 'fingerprints' of primary progressive aphasia at diagnosis

In this table, we summarise symptoms, signs and other features we have found useful in corroborating an initial clinical suspicion of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and in differentiating between the major variant syndromes: nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA), semantic (svPPA) and logopenic (lvPPA) (see also Figs. 1, 2, 3). The table is informed in part by surveys of caregivers for people living with primary progressive aphasia; however, not all patients with a given diagnosis will exhibit every feature, the chronology of deficits varies between individuals and nonverbal cognitive, behavioural and neurological features tend to become more prominent later in the illness (see text). a These features in our experience tend to develop early across syndromes and are useful in distinguishing PPA from other presentations with 'word finding difficulty', including health anxiety or functional cognitive disorder; b may include changes in humour, sociability, initiative, etc. as well as mood symptoms; c tends to be less prominent than speech apraxia but may sometimes lead the presentation, more reliably detected in written sentences if speech is very effortful; d this must be distinguished from anomia due to impaired word retrieval, which is very prominent in both svPPA and lvPPA and commonly seen across the PPA spectrum, and in other patients presenting to memory clinics; e by definition, initially subordinate to the language problem but of diagnostic and clinical relevance if present; f mild features of atypical parkinsonism (or less commonly, motor neuron disease) may be evident at presentation; g unable to recognise and/or demonstrate use of familiar items by sight); h we question the diagnosis of svPPA if the characteristic atrophy profile is absent, MRI features in other syndromes are substantially more variable

### Screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112toXBH]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF speech and language delay screening — implementation guidance: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for speech and language delay and disorders in younger children, and the USPSTF is calling for more research on the benefits and harms of screening, especially in populations known to have the highest burden. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether and how to screen for speech and language delay and disorders and should be aware of signs and symptoms and listen to any caregiver concerns.

### Neural changes induced by a speech motor treatment in childhood apraxia of speech: a case series [^113FF7fu]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic childhood apraxia of speech is a neurologic childhood disorder in which the precision and consistency of movements underlying speech are impaired, in the absence of neuromuscular deficits. Childhood apraxia of speech is usually interpreted as a motor speech disorder, whose core deficit involves the planning and/or programming of the spatiotemporal parameters of speech movement sequences.

The majority of children with idiopathic childhood apraxia of speech presents with normal structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that brain abnormalities might be too subtle to be detected by conventional MRI, but possibly could be revealed by the use of advanced brain imaging techniques. Fiori et alassessed whole brain connectivity in Italian children with childhood apraxia of speech and found significant alterations of inter- and intra-hemispheric connections of bilateral brain regions, correlating with a set of clinical speech measures. This is consistent with the finding of a bilateral reduction of premotor cortex connectivity in adults with acquired apraxia of speech compared with patients who did not develop apraxia, thus suggesting that unilateral abnormalities might be insufficient to determine apraxia. In a sample of children with developmental speech disorders, Morgan and Webstersuggested that altered connectivity of the left corticobulbar tract may be a neural marker of developmental speech disorders, whereas no abnormalities were detected in classical language tracts (such as the arcuate fasciculus).

Diffusion MRI allows exploration of brain connectivity through the assessment of the neural microstructural organization of white matter fiber tracts. Not only does this help to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of neurologic disorders, but it also allows for the exploration of brain neuroplastic processes, including the modifications observed during development or those associated with learning or disease. As such, changes in diffusion MRI parameters can be observed, for example, in the motor pathway following motor training, suggesting that diffusion MRI can capture treatment related structural brain plasticity. Although several intervention approaches have been successfully used in children with childhood apraxia of speech, only 1 study has shown treatment-related brain modifications, namely, in the volume of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, as assessed by MRI morphometry. No studies have explored the effects of any intervention on brain connectivity.

### MRI analysis of an inherited speech and language disorder: structural brain abnormalities [^116ZVmfm]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

Analyses of brain structure in genetic speech and language disorders provide an opportunity to identify neurobiological phenotypes and further elucidate the neural bases of language and its development. Here we report such investigations in a large family, known as the KE family, half the members of which are affected by a severe disorder of speech and language, which is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. The structural brain abnormalities associated with this disorder were investigated using two morphometric methods of MRI analysis. A voxel-based morphometric method was used to compare the amounts of grey matter in the brains of three groups of subjects: the affected members of the KE family, the unaffected members and a group of age-matched controls. This method revealed a number of mainly motor- and speech-related brain regions in which the affected family members had significantly different amounts of grey matter compared with the unaffected and control groups, who did not differ from each other. Several of these regions were abnormal bilaterally, including the caudate nucleus, which was of particular interest because this structure was also found to show functional abnormality in a related PET study. We performed a more detailed volumetric analysis of this structure. The results confirmed that the volume of this nucleus was reduced bilaterally in the affected family members compared with both the unaffected members and the group of age-matched controls. This reduction in volume was most evident in the superior portion of the nucleus. The volume of the caudate nucleus was significantly correlated with the performance of affected family members on a test of oral praxis, a test of non-word repetition and the coding subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. These results thus provide further evidence of a relationship between the abnormal development of this nucleus and the impairments in oromotor control and articulation reported in the KE family.

### Amyloid beta associations with connected speech in cognitively unimpaired adults [^114nFZzK]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The present research framework for defining Alzheimer's disease (AD) in living persons focuses on biomarkers, specifically measures of brain amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, pathological tau, and neurodegeneration, as assessed by measures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 1, 2 Accruing evidence that AD pathology accumulation begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms 1, 3 has prompted the development of multiple clinical trials investigating both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological early interventions. This movement has created an urgent need for sensitive tools that can measure functional and cognitive changes, particularly in the very early or preclinical stages of the AD continuum, and as measures of response to treatment in clinical trials. One such potential tool is the analysis of connected speech and language (CSL).

"Connected speech and language", also referred to as "connected speech", or "discourse", refers to spoken language that is used in a continuous sequence, as in everyday conversations. While episodic memory declines are a hallmark sign of AD, another early clinical symptom includes problems with communication, evidenced by both subjective complaints about word‐retrieval problems, 4 as well as by objective differences in semantic verbal fluency (naming items from a category under timed conditions). 5, 6 CSL production involves the coordination of multiple cognitive processes, including retrieval from semantic and episodic memory, 7 the ability to sustain and divide attention for error monitoring, 8 and reliance upon working memory for syntax organization. 9 Changes in CSL, consisting of fluency disruptions and limited semantic content, have long been noted in persons with dementia 10, 11, 12 moreover, accruing research suggests that subtle, yet detectable, changes in CSL are present even in preclinical stages of cognitive decline. 13, 14, 15 Because CSL is an ecologically valid measure of language use (it approximates "everyday talking"), and because it is quick, inexpensive, able to be collected remotely, and presents low burden to participants, it is a potentially valuable digital cognitive marker to explore in the context of AD studies.

Neurodevelopmental conditions are common, heterogeneous and sometimes complex. Cognitive impairment, learning disability, behavioural dysfunction are reported to be around 66%, but systematic data is lacking. Approximately 20–25% of patients meet criteria for intellectual disability (ID), but the literature is not always clear on the distinction between ID and learning disability, which is found in 60% of patients.

The following traits have been noted: mean intellectual functioning at − 1.5 SD below the mean, –impairments in verbal fluency (22–44%) and perceptual reasoning (53%), reduction in attention capacity (69%) and lack of functional independence (74%), though most patients do not have ID. Autism spectrum disease (ASD), presenting as behavioural rigidity, sensory sensitivity, issues in peer socialisation or social and/or emotional reciprocity, have been found to occur in 77% of patients. Behaviour and psychiatric features occur in around 30% of patients, with obsessive-compulsive behaviours, anxiety and mood disorders.

Receptive and expressive speech delay and hypernasal speech have been observed and are in part linked to hearing problems, as mild hearing deficiency is found in 17–21% of patients.

Impaired learning and memory could be associated with pathological alterations in hippocampal primary neuronal cilia. On morphological grounds, MRIs scans of the CNS have identified hippocampal dysgenesis with reduced hippocampal volume, hypoplasia of olfactory bulbs, cerebellar hypoplasia and cerebellar atrophy.

Anosmia is common and thought to be linked to hypoplasia of olfactory bulbs.

Epilepsy has been reported (4–10%), and so has ataxia, with impaired motor coordination, but is poorly documented.

### Primary progressive aphasia: a clinical approach [^116ArQtX]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

On examination, the patient's speech is derailed by word retrieval pauses and (often marked) anomia, though this is usually not as severe (from such an early stage) as in svPPA. This syndrome illustrates the difficulty of dichotomising PPA syndromes as 'nonfluent' versus 'fluent': patients with lvPPA in general do not talk fluently, yet their speech sounds quite different to the mutilated utterances of nfvPPA (compare Supplementary sound files 1, 2 and 4). Generally, phonological speech sound errors can be detected, usually taking the form of syllable misselections that are enunciated clearly and not accompanied by the false starts and distortions that characterise nfvPPA. Reading aloud is similarly marred by syllabic substitutions, highlighted by sounding out non-words (e.g. proper names) that rely on phonological decoding rather than learned vocabulary. Analogous errors of written spelling are often evident (Table 3). The diagnostic feature of lvPPA that distinguishes it from other PPA syndromes is early and disproportionate difficulty repeating heard phrases and sentences versus single words (see Table 2). This signifies an impairment of verbal (phonological) working memory, also indexed as a reduced auditory span for repetition of random digit strings. While digit span is often also reduced in nfvPPA, in that syndrome repetition of single words and repetition of phrases are comparably degraded. Other dominant (and often, bi-hemispheric) posterior cortical signs such as limb apraxia and visual apperceptive agnosia can frequently be elicited in lvPPA. This extra-linguistic cognitive phenotype tends to be more extensive and severe than in other PPA syndromes at a comparable stage of clinical evolution (see Fig. 1). Some clinical 'pearls' relevant to lvPPA are presented in Table 4.

Neuroanatomy

The key neuroimaging association is asymmetric atrophy mainly involving the temporo-parietal junction zone of the dominant hemisphere, appearing as widening of the posterior left Sylvian fissure on a T1-weighted coronal MRI scan (Fig. 1). This locus potentially accounts for many features of the language phenotype, since posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal cortices are intimately involved in decoding speech sounds and activating phonological representations to link verbal semantic stores to language output. However, there is often extension of atrophy more anteriorly with involvement of other structures (notably the hippocampi) and the overall extent and pattern of atrophy varies widely between individual patients.

### Epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders of language [^113U21P1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neurodevelopmental disorders of language are increasingly appreciated as part of the phenotype of childhood-onset epilepsy. Here I review studies of the prevalence and prognosis of language impairment in new-onset childhood epilepsy and provide an update of new genetic discoveries that shed light on molecular pathways common to epilepsy and language impairment.

Recent Findings

Three recent papers describe the cognitive and language phenotype of children with new-onset epilepsy and their discrepancy with controls over a 2–3-year period of follow-up. A new study examines the question of pleiotropic effects acting on both electro-encephalographic (EEG) abnormalities and speech sound disorder in rolandic epilepsy families - another study questions the rationale for EEG recording in patients with specific language impairment (SLI) - whereas two studies examine the effect of anti-epileptic drug treatment on speech and language. Two MRI studies indicate the neural basis for language impairment in epilepsy. Three new copy number variant hotspots are reported linking epilepsy and speech or language impairment; and the links between two known genes for developmental verbal dyspraxia, FOXP2 and SRPX2, begin to be elucidated.

Summary

Comprehensive neuropsychological and speech pathology assessment need to be factored into the initial evaluation and continued monitoring of children with new-onset epilepsy. EEG recording remains of unknown utility in children with SLI or speech sound disorder (SSD) who do not have epilepsy. Some anti-epileptic drugs may worsen SSD. As the molecular pathways for speech continue to be elucidated, future genetic imaging studies will show how genetic variants map onto to altered structural and connectivity patterns, which could be used as biomarkers for interventions.

### Diagnosing and managing velopharyngeal insufficiency in patients with cleft palate after primary palatoplasty [^113A6B7Q]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging has been promoted for the evaluation of the velopharynx, providing high-quality, reproducible, static, dynamic, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional imaging. Unlike videofluoroscopy, MRI does not require radiation exposure. Some studies have described synchronizing audio and video samples during speech without delay, making real-time dynamic visualization in combination with speech assessment possible. However, MRI sometimes requires sedation in younger children to reduce motion artefacts, and still remains cost prohibitive. Magnetic resonance imaging may offer a radiation-free, better tolerated and more precise diagnostic tool of velopharyngeal sphincter function in the future. Perry and her colleagues have done comprehensive research on MRI in velopharyngeal anatomy evaluation, establishing the role of MRI in 3-dimensional imaging of velopharyngeal anatomy, dynamic evaluation of velopharyngeal sphincter during speech,– and often with no use of sedation. Furthermore, the use is still limited and under examination, but ongoing studies will show if MRI will have the potential to be the new standard diagnostic tool of velopharyngeal sphincter.

### Current evidence-based recommendations on investigating children with global developmental delay [^113JzwDj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Global developmental delay (GDD) is defined as a delay in two or more developmental domains of gross/fine motor, speech/language, cognition, social/personal and activities of daily living, affecting children under the age of 5 years. The degree of developmental delay is further subclassified as: mild (functional age < 33% below chronological age), moderate (functional age 34%–66% of chronological age) and severe (functional age < 66% of chronological age).GDD is considered significant when there is a deficit in performance of at least 2 SD below the age appropriate mean on accepted standardised assessment tests. With a prevalence of 1%–3%, GDD is one of the the most common conditions encountered in paediatrics with genetic and structural brain abnormalities being the most frequent causes. Establishing a diagnosis enables clinicians to define treatment options and conduct surveillance for known complications as well as provide prognosis and condition-specific family support (including family planning choices). This ensures the best overall outcomes for the child and their families/carers. A diagnosis may also provide an explanation, a source of closure or acceptance to parents and stops clinicians advancing to potentially more expensive and invasive tests

Previous estimates for the yield of investigations for GDD are broad (10%–81%). The variability may be due to differences in patient populations, clinical settings where tests are performed and the range of tests undertaken. The last evidence-based UK guideline for investigation of developmental delay was published 10 years ago. With the advent of more recent techniques in genetics and a recent burgeoning of guidelines in other countries, there is a need to review our practice in the UK.

The primary objective of this paper is to provide (1) an update of the latest evidence for investigation of GDD, (2) recommendations for investigations and (3) evidence relating to yield and cost from literature presently available.

Participants

A total of 120 patients with a diagnosis of PPAwere prospectively recruited from 2 referral clinics in Lombardy (Italy) and referred to IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in Milan between 2010 and 2021 for a multimodal longitudinal prospective study, which involved neuropsychological and clinical assessments, and brain MRI. In both centers, the diagnosis of PPA variants was clinically reached according to the current criteria. It was supported by the available imaging (MRI and/or FDG-PET) and the CSF (details in the eMethods) profile when available and confirmed by a multidisciplinary team that included neurologists, neuropsychologists, speech pathologists, and neuroradiologists, all expert in neurodegeneration and PPA. From the large cohort, we included participants who had undergone a neurologic examination, a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and an audiorecorded "Picnic Scene" test from the WAB. Some patients also underwent a brain MRI scan, and, among them, some had a lumbar puncture as part of their diagnostic workup. Finally, a subgroup of patients underwent a neuropsychological follow-up visit, which included both standard tests and the "Picnic Scene" test.

The first group of HCs (HC-speech), who were similar to patients with PPA regarding sex, age, and education, was recruited among nonconsanguineous relatives and by word of mouth. They underwent a neuropsychological screening that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the "Picnic Scene" test. A second group of HCs (HC-MRI) was retrospectively selected to match the PPA subgroup undergoing MRI scans regarding sex, age, education, and the MRI scanner used for data acquisition. Inclusion criteria for both HC groups were the following: age range 60–80 years; education range 5–18 years; MMSE score > 27; absence of mood disturbances as demonstrated by a score less than 15 in the BDI; no family history of neurodegenerative diseases.

Participants (patients with PPA, HC-speech, and HC-MRI) were excluded if they had significant (other) medical illnesses or substance abuse that could interfere with cognitive functioning; any (other) major systemic, psychiatric, or neurologic illnesses; and (other) causes of focal or diffuse brain damage, including cerebrovascular disease at conventional MRI scans.

### Primary progressive aphasia: a clinical approach [^116uC6o1]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The profile of the patient's language dysfunction then allows the clinico-anatomical syndrome to be characterised (see Table 1). Fundamentally, language supports communication — the understanding, creation and delivery of messages. In assessing a patient's speech, it is useful to analyse the various stages at which the idea for a message is first generated, the content (or vocabulary) of the message, its structure (assembly) and delivery. Similarly, in assessing understanding of language, it is useful to analyse the separable stages at which messages are perceived and then invested with meaning. These operations are differentially vulnerable to particular PPA syndromes and can be explored using targeted questions on history and a small set of core language tests (Table 2). The patient's use of written language typically echoes the speech disorder as the illness evolves. Examples of patients' transcribed spoken and written productions are presented in Table 3 (corresponding speech sound files are provided in Supplementary Material on-line).

In neurology, the history generally suggests the diagnosis while the examination corroborates the historical suspicion. This precept is equally valid for language disorders, with the caveat that certain aspects of language are difficult to differentiate on the story alone. One key example (not often called upon in everyday communication) is the ability to repeat messages verbatim, which is central to the characterisation of PPA (see Table 1) and should be examined explicitly. Like the testing of pupillary and spinal reflexes in general neurology, certain language tests such as speech repetition or picture naming rapidly assay a number of connected neural operations: if such tests are performed normally, this demonstrates the overall integrity of the system but if a problem is found, it is necessary to establish where in the system it lies. The most important principle in examining speech is to obtain an adequate sample; for this purpose, it is convenient to carry a picture that will encourage the patient to talk and provide a prop for directed tests (one example is shown in Fig. 2).

Alongside the core clinical tests in Table 2 we list some more formal equivalents that might be administered by a neuropsychologist. However, neuropsychological assessment does not simply endorse the bedside impression. If available, it adds considerable value, particularly in quantifying language capacities in relation to standardised population norms and in the context of estimated premorbid ability, in tracking change in language functions over time and in measuring associated capacities that together with aphasia define the overall cognitive phenotype and may also affect the assessment of language.

2.4 Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist?

Some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), accompanying mood/behavioral disturbance (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality), rapid progression, or fluctuating course (e.g. suggestive of potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID; Figure 3). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing within weeks or months) are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in‐patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs and considerations regarding safety than patients with typical presentations of dementia due to AD. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young‐onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

Magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography image acquisition

All subjects underwent a standardized MRI imaging protocol at 3.0 T, which included a 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (repetition time/echo time/T 1 = 2300/3/900 ms; flip angle 8°, 26-cm field of view; 256 × 256 in-plane matrix with a phase field of view of 0.94, slice thickness of 1.2 mm, in-plane resolution 1) and a single-shot echo-planar diffusion tensor imaging pulse sequence (repetition time = 10 200 ms; in-plane matrix 128/128; in-plane resolution 2.7, field 35 cm; phase field of view 0.66; 42 diffusion encoding steps and four non-diffusion weighted T 2 images; 2.7 mm isotropic resolution). Parallel imaging with a sensitivity encoding factor of 2 was used for the diffusion tensor imaging acquisition.

All PET scans were acquired using a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare) operating in 3D mode. For fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, subjects were injected with fluorodeoxyglucose (average, 459 MBq; range, 367–576 MBq) in a dimly lit room with minimal auditory stimulation. After a 30-min uptake period an 8-min fluorodeoxyglucose scan was performed consisting of four 2-min dynamic frames following a low dose CT transmission scan. For PiB-PET, subjects were injected with PiB (average, 614 MBq; range, 414–695 MBq) and after a 40–60-min uptake period a 20 min PiB scan was obtained consisting of four 5-min dynamic frames following a low dose CT transmission scan. Standard corrections were applied. Individual frames of the fluorodeoxyglucose and PiB dynamic series were realigned if motion was detected and then a mean image was created. Emission data were reconstructed into a 256 × 256 matrix with a 30-cm field of view. The image thickness was 3.75 mm.

### Chiari malformation I and autism spectrum disorder: an underrecognized coexistence [^112nCdu6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Object

Patients with symptomatic Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) frequently present with headaches, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, and balance disturbances. In children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), diagnosing CM-I can be a challenging task. Moreover, even if symptomatic, some patients do not undergo further evaluation or management, as their presentations are attributed to autism and its myriad symptoms. Therefore, cranial MRI findings were reviewed after evaluating and treating patients with coexisting ASD and CM-I. In this paper, the authors report on 5 children with ASD and symptomatic CM-I, including their clinical presentation, imaging studies, management, and outcomes, and discuss the likely underrecognized coexistence of these conditions.

Methods

All pediatric patients with ASD and cranial MRI conducted for any reason in the period from 1999 to 2013 were considered for analysis. All cases with concomitant symptomatic CM-I were eligible for this retrospective analysis.

Results

One hundred twenty-five pediatric patients diagnosed with ASD had undergone MRI, and 9 of them had evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Five patients were symptomatic and underwent suboccipital craniectomy, a C-1 or a C-1 and C-2 laminectomy, and duraplasty with bovine pericardium or Type I collagen allograft. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients showed symptom improvement and/or resolution of presenting symptoms, which included headache, dysphasia, speech, and irritability.

Conclusions

There is no identified cause of autism. Children with ASD can be difficult to assess specifically in a neurological examination. Thus, cranial MRI considered when completing a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. While cranial MRI is not a routine part of ASD evaluation, this study demonstrates that CM-I and ASD may coexist and be underrecognized. The study reinforces the importance of a comprehensive medical evaluation designed to elucidate neurological findings in children with impaired communication abilities and suggests the judicious use of neuroimaging.

This study incorporated data from four different cohorts, comprising a total of 633 individuals with PD: (1) the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) encompassing 315 unmedicated de novo PD; (2) patients from the Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders Unit at Hospital Clínic and the University of Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain (Barcelona UB-Clínic), comprising 107 PD who were undergoing medication; (3) the Karolinska Imaging in Movement Disorders Study (KIMOVE) conducted at Karolinska University Hospital (Sweden), involving 136 PD; and (4) the Exercise in Parkinson's disease and Neuroplasticity (EXPANd) study, also conducted at Karolinska University Hospital (Sweden), encompassing 75 participants with PD. PPMI data used in the preparation of this article were obtained [April, 30, 2023] from the PPMI database, RRID:SCR_006431 upon request after approval by the PPMI Data Access Committee. For up-to-date information on the study, visit. In the PPMI cohort, patients with PD who were taking antiparkinsonian medication were excluded; while in the Barcelona UB-Clínic cohort, only patients with PD taking antiparkinsonian drugs were included. In addition, PPMI and Barcelona UB-Clínic cohorts had clinical data for up to six years of follow-up. EXPANd and KIMOVE cohorts did not have any specific requirements regarding the medication status for inclusion in the study. The KIMOVE cohort consisted of patients with PD from the Karolinska University Hospital Neurology outpatient clinic who had underwent MRI examination at the Karolinska University Hospital Radiology Department as part of their clinical workup. This cohort included individuals both with and without medication. In EXPANd, participants had mild-moderate stage PD, and were recruited in a context where individuals were chosen for an intervention. Consequently, they needed to be suitable candidates, even though in the current study the sample was pre-intervention. Therefore, the inclusion criteria required absence of other disorders significantly impacting balance, voice, or speech performance; as well as not experiencing severe states of tremor, dyskinesia, or dystonia, nor present with inability to hear instructions without hearing aid. PD with a diagnosis of dementia were excluded in all the cohorts. Additionally, analyses included data from 233 HC, including 151 from PPMI, 44 from Barcelona UB-Clínic and 38 from EXPANd. Participants with sMRI scans exhibiting motion artifacts, poor image quality or failed FreeSurfer segmentation were excluded. Local ethics committee at each center approved the study. All participating PPMI sites received approval from an ethical standards committee prior to study initiation, for a list of participant sites see. Barcelona-UB Clínic dataset was collected under a protocol approved by the University of Barcelona and Hospital Clínic bioethical committees: Institutional Review Board (IRB00003099). KIMOVE was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm 2015/1607–31. EXPANd was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm 2016/1264–31/4, 2017/125832 and 2017/2445–32. Written consent on participation was obtained from all patients or appropriate surrogates according to the Declaration of Helsinki, except for the KIMOVE cohort where informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^116XF68P]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Validity of central auditory tests — brain–behavior and lesion-based evidence is described by noting that if certain adult lesion-based test patterns show good sensitivity and specificity, "one may presume a high degree of likelihood" that the same pattern "confirms a (C)APD" in children or older adults, while an alternate view cautions that adult brain damage may not mirror developmental CANS disorders in children and that applicability of adult-standardized tests to children may be limited. The page states that "test efficiency measured on subjects with well-defined lesions of the CANS provides an important guide for establishing the validity of central auditory diagnostic tests", highlights reports in children with perisylvian polymicrogyria as among the strongest evidence that structural brain changes linked to auditory/language regions can lead to auditory processing and language/learning changes, and asserts that such studies demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of current central tests across populations. It further notes that investigation of auditory evoked responses to complex signals may offer a clinically feasible approach for defining a "gold standard" for (C)APD in children, with "Levels of evidence: 2, 3".

### Connected speech alterations and progression in patients with primary progressive aphasia variants [^113nx6GG]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnosing the different variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is challenging, but more accurate characterization can improve patient management and treatment outcomes. This study aimed to identify the following: (1) which speech features, alone or combined with language assessment and gray matter volumes (GMVs), best distinguish PPA variants and (2) how connected speech evolves in PPA.

Methods

This prospective study was conducted at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, between 2010 and 2021. We included patients with PPA who underwent neuropsychological assessments, including standard evaluation of language and the "Picnic Scene" speech test, and, when available, brain structural MRI. Clinical and language assessments were also performed at follow-up in a subgroup. Sequential feature selection models identified speech parameters that best differentiated groups, incorporating age, sex, education, standard language tests, and GMVs. In each PPA group, linear mixed-effect models analyzed speech changes over time.

Results

We included 95 patients with PPA (mean age 69 ± 9 years, 55 women [58%]; 40 with nonfluent variant PPA [nfvPPA], 35 with semantic variant PPA [svPPA], 20 with logopenic variant PPA [lvPPA]), of whom 82 underwent brain MRI and 34 had a follow-up visit after 10.2 months. Each model distinguished svPPA from the other PPA groups with high accuracy (R² range 0.93–1.00; p < 0.001). No differences in accuracy were observed among models for this distinction. In differentiating nfvPPA and lvPPA groups, the models incorporating speech parameters (R² = 0.92; p < 0.001), GMVs (R² = 0.95; p < 0.001), and their combination (speech + GMVs; R² = 0.97; p < 0.001) outperformed those using only standard language scores (R² = 0.75; p = 0.01). Over time, patients with nfvPPA showed more phonological errors, the svPPA group exhibited more semantic and morphosyntactic errors along with difficulties in naming and syntax production, and patients with lvPPA exhibited reduced number of words per second and fewer words per sentence.

Discussion

All models were equally effective in distinguishing the svPPA group from the other 2 PPA subtypes. However, compared with using standard measures alone, incorporating speech measures from the "Picnic Scene" speech test, GMVs, or their combination into the models significantly improved accuracy in differentiating nfvPPA and lvPPA groups. The PPA variants showed distinct speech trajectories. These variables can aid in understanding disease progression, predicting patient outcomes, and planning speech therapy interventions in clinical practice.

### Using magnetic resonance imaging for early assessment of submucous cleft palate: a case report [^111GJ5Na]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Surgical correction for submucous cleft palate is generally indicated in the presence of velopharyngeal inadequacy. Clinical assessment of velopharyngeal inadequacy requires that the child is able to produce a connected speech sample, which can yield a delay in treatment decisions that extends through a critical period of speech and language development. A perceptual speech assessment and intraoral examination are traditionally the most important methods of establishing a diagnosis of submucous cleft palate. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool to provide early identification and an indication of surgical treatment for an individual born with a submucous cleft palate. The magnetic resonance images indicated a discontinuous levator veli palatini muscle sling arrangement with attachment of the muscle bundles onto the hard palate. Surgery was performed at 16 months and postsurgical speech evaluations demonstrated normal resonance and age-appropriate speech.

### Pathogenic variants in USP7 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with speech delays, altered behavior, and neurologic anomalies [^1122iUxS]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroradiologic examination

Brain MRI analysis and/or chart review identified neuroradiologic anomalies in 11 of 15 individuals, with primary features of decreased white matter and thinning of corpora callosa. Specifically, chart review of four individuals (2, 5, 9, and 19) noted neuroradiologic anomalies via MRI to include decreased white matter; in addition, periventricular leukomalacia was noted in patient 5. Chart review of MRI analysis for patients 4, 10, 12, and 23 noted no abnormalities. The imaging for these eight individuals was not available for secondary analysis. MR imaging and results for seven more individuals (3 and 13–18), ranging in age at imaging from 4 weeks to 17 years of life, were made available and secondarily analyzed by an independent pediatric neuroradiologist (Fig. 3). Analysis included biometry of the corpus callosum for all individuals except for patient 13 (as a digital ruler was not provided with the images) and comparison with age-matched reference values(Table S 5). Though a spectrum of findings was noted, overall there appeared to be a generalized paucity of white matter with or without white matter T2 hyperintensities. Of note was marked symmetry to the hemispheres of all the children examined with a shallow pattern to the gyri. In addition, the splenium and body of the corpus callosum were generally thin, with varying degrees of dysmorphism.

### Connected speech alterations and progression in patients with primary progressive aphasia variants [^116jeSNZ]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The overlapping features in lvPPA and nfvPPA, such as slow speech production and reduced syntactic complexity, make distinguishing between these 2 variants particularly difficult. Among all speech characteristics, the most informative for differentiating lvPPA and nfvPPA is the presence of phonetic distortions, which are more frequent in the latter.

However, although phonetic distortions are commonly observed in English-speaking patients with nfvPPA, they are rare in Italian cases, making differential diagnosis in our country still complex. Recent studies have significantly advanced clinical practice by improving the ability to characterize and differentiate these phenotypes in vivo. This has been achieved through a combination of standard and experimental language assessments, alongside single or multimodal neuroimaging techniques. Despite these substantial advancements, accurately distinguishing these clinical presentations remains challenging.

Furthermore, research on how speech evolves over time in patients with PPA is still limited. A deeper understanding of how language abilities change over time in these conditions could improve speech therapy interventions, enhance prognostic accuracy, and refine monitoring in treatment trials.

In this study, we aimed to identify which aspects of connected speech, whether used alone or in combination with standard language tests and/or brain gray matter volumes (GMVs), most effectively distinguish between the PPA variants. In addition, we conducted a longitudinal analysis on a subgroup of participants with PPA to investigate how connected speech evolves over time within each PPA variant.

Speech intelligibility considerations — before administering behavioral tasks of central auditory function that require a verbal response, it is important to assure adequate speech production so responses can be accurately interpreted; individuals with multiple articulation errors resulting in reduced speech intelligibility may not be good candidates for speech-stimuli behavioral assessment unless a modified response mode can be adopted such as a picture pointing response or written response.

### Classification of primary progressive aphasia and its variants [^1173jJNL]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

This article provides a classification of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and its 3 main variants to improve the uniformity of case reporting and the reliability of research results. Criteria for the 3 variants of PPA — nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic — were developed by an international group of PPA investigators who convened on 3 occasions to operationalize earlier published clinical descriptions for PPA subtypes. Patients are first diagnosed with PPA and are then divided into clinical variants based on specific speech and language features characteristic of each subtype. Classification can then be further specified as "imaging-supported" if the expected pattern of atrophy is found and "with definite pathology" if pathologic or genetic data are available. The working recommendations are presented in lists of features, and suggested assessment tasks are also provided. These recommendations have been widely agreed upon by a large group of experts and should be used to ensure consistency of PPA classification in future studies. Future collaborations will collect prospective data to identify relationships between each of these syndromes and specific biomarkers for a more detailed understanding of clinicopathologic correlations.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^1175Y3zw]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder (ID/IDD) etiologic evaluation and genetic testing — Children with ID/IDD are at greater risk for vision and hearing impairment, and all children with ID/IDD should be considered for screening for these problems. If no etiology is strongly suggested, the following stepwise approach to additional testing is recommended: existing guidelines recommend that focused metabolic testing such as serum amino acids and urine organic acids be considered in individuals with suggestive clinical features, physical examination findings, or history; guidelines also recommend consideration of an electroencephalogram (EEG) if seizures or paroxysmal events are suspected, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if there are historical findings, physical findings, or abnormal neurologic findings. Guidelines recommend a chromosomal microarray in all individuals with ID of undetermined etiology, with an abnormal result reported in 7.8% of subjects with GDD/ID/IDD and in 10.6% of those with syndromic features, on average; the degree of intellectual disability/developmental delay does not predict the diagnostic yield. Existing guidelines recommend that all individuals (male and female) with ID/IDD of undetermined etiology also have specific testing for Fragile X syndrome, and that girls with severe impairment may be appropriate for testing for MECP2 mutations, with FMR1 testing having a combined yield of at least 2% in male and female subjects with mild GDD/ID/IDD, MECP2 mutations found in 1.5% of girls with moderate/severe GDD/ID/IDD and in less than 0.5% of males with GDD/IDD; for X-linked inheritance, the AAP guidelines suggest a complete X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) panel with exome/genome sequencing as a viable alternative, noting that mutations in X-linked genes may explain up to 10% of all cases of GDD/ID and that testing of XLID genes has a yield of 42% in males from definitely X-linked families and of 17% in males from possibly X-linked families.

### Guideline on treatment and management of craniosynostosis: patient and family version [^117RvCKy]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CHAPTER 13. HEARING IMPAIRMENTS AND SPEECH/LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

Question 13.1 What is the policy on hearing impairments and speech/language development in craniosynostosis?

There are several reasons why patients with craniosynostosis have hearing impairments and/or a delay in language/speech development. Hearing loss can be an additional cause of developmental delay in children who are already at increased risk.
What type of hearing loss occurs in patients with craniosynostosis and at what frequency?

Hearing loss should be considered in all children with syndromic craniosynostosis: (1) 61% to 71% in Muenke syndrome, (2) 44% to 80% in Apert syndrome, (3) 92% in Pfeiffer syndrome, (4) 29% to 74% in Crouzon syndrome, and (5) 29% in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. ~7% of children with multisuture craniosynostosis have hearing loss.

Hearing loss in children with syndromic and multisuture craniosynostosis is caused by sounds not being properly conducted through the ear canal and/or middle ear to the inner ear (conductive hearing loss). In Muenke syndrome, hearing loss is mainly caused because the inner ear or auditory nerve is abnormal (sensorineural hearing loss).

Neurologic features and recommendations

The prototypical subject displays intellectual disability, global developmental delays, gross and/or fine motor delay, hypotonia, and speech delay. In many cases speech delay was severe enough for speech to be considered absent. In addition, the presence of tonic-clonic seizures was not uncommon. Virtually all individuals have neonatal hypotonia, and several had neurogenic scoliosis. For Individual 45, intervention for neurogenic scoliosis was attempted with placement of rods. The percentages for some of the neurologic features are shown in Table 1.

Neuroimaging has been obtained in a number of these individuals and there is a paper in preparation regarding detailed analysis of brain MRI findings. The majority possessed at least one brain abnormality with corpus callosum hypoplasia and microcephaly being by far the most common findings followed by periventricular leukomalacia (see Supplementary Table 1 for exact figures). In some cases, there was a finding of cerebral atrophy. However, there was no radiographic evidence to explain their hypotonia or growth failure.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^1118AeKr]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Cognitive abilities — The individual's mental age and cognitive status (including IQ) can influence the ability to complete complex behavioral measures and may make interpretation difficult or render results invalid; in cases of questionable cognitive function or intelligence, the need for multidisciplinary assessment becomes imperative. Results of cognitive, neuropsychological, psychoeducational and speech-language assessments can inform whether to proceed with central auditory processing evaluation and how to interpret test results, and when critical assessment data are not available and a significant deficit is suspected, referral to another professional (e.g., psychologist, speech-language pathologist, neuropsychologist) may be warranted before a central auditory assessment is undertaken. Some young children and individuals with developmental delay or acquired brain injury may be unable to complete behavioral testing due to limited capacity to meet language, memory and/or attention demands, and elderly individuals may present with decreased memory or attention that can negatively impact performance on measures of central auditory function.

### Multiparametric MRI-based biomarkers in the non-fluent and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia [^116nzhBk]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The results of this study have to be considered in the context of several limitations. First, the sample size for longitudinal analyses was relatively small (although in a reasonable range for imaging studies to obtain statistically significant results and adequate, given the rarity of these diseases). However, standardized DTI acquisition protocols have been shown to yield reliable and reproducible results even in studies with limited sample sizes, supporting the robustness of our findings despite the reduced cohort. This allows us to generalize the significance of our findings, despite acknowledging that future studies should replicate our investigations with a bigger pool of subjects. Second, we acknowledge that the limited availability of follow-up MRI data may have introduced a drop-out bias, potentially favoring the inclusion of patients with milder disease progression and better clinical stability. Third, our phenotyping approach was limited to the first-level classification of PPA into the traditionally recognized semantic and non-fluent variants. Nonetheless, recent advancements emphasize the importance of a more detailed categorization of progressive language deficits, incorporating newly defined sub-syndromes to better capture the heterogeneity of these conditions. On the one hand, nfPPA has been recently distinguished in (at least) two subtypes whose core features are agrammatism and speech apraxia. However, although TDP-43 has been sporadically detected in autoptic studies of primary progressive apraxia of speech patients, a tauopathy remains the most frequently detected pathology underlying all non-fluent PPA variants. On the other hand, symptomatologic overlap between svPPA and a right temporal variant of FTD has been documented. Some patients who were retrospectively included in this study could have been currently categorized as being affected by a right temporal variant of FTD (rtvFTD) whose presentation also includes subtle language deficits, but the underlying pathology of rtvFTD is believed to predominantly involve TDP-43, with a reported frequency as high as 90%, similar to that observed in svPPA. Given the pathological uniformity within the nfPPA and temporal lobe PPA syndromes, we are confident that, while deeper clinical phenotyping would undoubtedly enhance the precision of neuroimaging investigations, it would not have significantly altered the outcomes of our study. Furthermore, on a qualitative assessment of our MRI scans, only one subject could be found to show a higher degree of atrophy in the right rather than left temporal lobe in the svPPA group. Although our study did not include patients with logopenic PPA, this does not constitute a limitation, as the diagnostic workup for logopenic PPA relies mainly on CSF or blood-based biomarkers to demonstrate Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas neuroimaging remains the primary in vivo tool for the diagnosis of FTLD-spectrum variants such as nfPPA and svPPA.

In order to increase the clinical reliability and usefulness of fMRI, further research is required, particularly with regards to the factors that contribute to inaccuracies in fMRI. We do not always understand what factors have played a role in individual cases, what other patient‐specific variables (if any) may have impacted the findings, and also how to adjust for these variables so as to yield the most accurate findings in an individual patient. This will involve creating standard fMRI protocols, validating them and collecting normative data from healthy populations and a range of clinical populations. Currently, standard paradigms are lacking (Benjamin et al. 2018).

### Multimodality imaging in primary progressive aphasia [^11156Sez]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary progressive aphasia is a clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by language-predominant impairment and commonly associated with atrophy of the dominant language hemisphere. While this clinical entity has been recognized dating back to the 19th century, important advances have been made in defining our current understanding of primary progressive aphasia, with 3 recognized subtypes to date: logopenic variant, semantic variant, and nonfluent/agrammatic variant. Given the ongoing progress in our understanding of the neurobiology and genomics of these rare neurodegenerative conditions, accurate imaging diagnoses are of the utmost importance and carry implications for future therapeutic triaging. This review covers the diverse spectrum of primary progressive aphasia and its multimodal imaging features, including structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging findings; it also highlights currently recognized diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, histopathologic biomarkers, and treatment options of these 3 primary progressive aphasia subtypes.

### Neural mechanisms driving speech and language recovery following childhood stroke: a scoping review [^114DgQcb]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This scoping review aimed to inform future research priorities by collating evidence on neural correlates of speech and language recovery following childhood stroke.

Methods

Neuroimaging, motor speech, or language outcomes following childhood stroke (28days to 18years age) in the subacute to chronic community stages (care occurring after acute medical management, including inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, and community-based programs) were identified and extracted from Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Clinical databases.

Results

Of the 3990 studies screened, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Of the included articles, no papers formally assessed speech outcomes, 11 articles reported language outcomes through standardized testing, 11 utilized structural imaging (CT, MRI), and four reported functional neuroimaging outcomes (fMRI).

Interpretation

This review revealed a rudimentary accounting of speech and language profiles in children post-stroke; limited by the use of varied and incomplete speech and language assessment batteries, inconsistent reporting of lesion locations associated with speech and language outcomes, a dearth of functional neuroimaging studies, and lack of information about speech and language function throughout the rehabilitation period, a time when the brain is most plastic and receptive to therapy. Future research should provide complete and accurate accounts of speech and language function and their neural correlates throughout rehabilitation and recovery to inform care, education, and employment planning.

### Language and language disorders: neuroscience to clinical practice [^113jdYi9]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pragmatic language

Pragmatic deficits can arise with lesions not expected to affect language, such as in the right hemisphere, and create a significant — often unacknowledged — impairment in a patient's overall ability to communicate. For example, apparently rude or abrupt behaviour might arise when a patient cannot control the tone or volume of their voice, or has a new inability to perceive, or rely on, facial expressions to support communication. Speech and language therapists routinely assess pragmatic language and can provide valuable information to aid communication with patients and carers.

Formal language assessments

Quantified assessment batteries can often supplement informal assessment in an inpatient setting. For conversational speech, quantified assessment can be based on a more detailed sample of a person's language production skills (often around 2–3 min). This can be done though tasks such as describing a complex picture or through story retelling. There are several available standardised assessments of naming skills. Selecting an appropriate test is based on several factors including the severity of the suspected impairment, with tests such as the Boston Naming Test being most appropriate for the more severely impaired, and the Graded Naming Test (or the Philadelphia Naming Test in the United States) for those likely to have more subtle naming deficits.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: efficient investigation of the child with early developmental impairment in the era of genomic sequencing [^116FDY25]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

The investigation of children with early developmental impairment (EDI) is challenging in terms of selecting investigations and supporting families through the diagnostic pathway. Modern genomic sequencing has the potential to greatly improve yield of investigation, but produces challenges in terms of timing and explaining its strengths/weaknesses to families. We present an evidence-based and practical guideline to help the paediatrician through all stages of investigation. We emphasise the importance of a really good history and examination, allowing targeted investigation for specific disorders and outline an approach for isolated EDI when this is not possible. This prioritises genetic investigation- after appropriate counselling to families, and balances the very low yield of biochemical/radiological investigations in isolated EDI, with the need to detect extremely rare, but potentially treatable disorders. Collaboration with both families and regional specialists to ensure appropriate testing is likely to reduce parental and clinician anxiety.

### Myo-inositol deficiency, structural brain changes, and cerebral perfusion alterations in classic galactosemia: preliminary insights from a multiparametric MRI study [^117UfLDw]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Classic galactosemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the galactose‐1‐phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) gene. This enzyme deficiency disrupts normal galactose metabolism, leading to the toxic accumulation of galactose and its derivatives — galactose‐1‐phosphate (G‐1‐P) and galactitol — in red blood cells and many other cells, tissues, and body fluids, such as urine and plasma. Early detection via newborn screening, followed by immediate dietary intervention with a galactose‐restricted (i.e. lactose‐free) diet, effectively prevents severe neonatal complications, including liver failure, sepsis, cataract, and death. However, despite early and lifelong dietary treatment, patients remain at risk for significant long‐term complications, particularly central nervous system (CNS)‐related neurodevelopmental delay or premature ovarian failure in females.

The most prevalent and debilitating CNS‐related manifestations include cognitive impairments, learning difficulties, motor speech and language deficits (e.g. childhood apraxia of speech, dysarthria), movement disorders (e.g. tremor, ataxia), and psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, emerging regardless of treatment timing and despite adherence to a strict diet. These persistent neurological and neuropsychological deficits suggest an underlying brain pathology that remains insufficiently understood and inadequately addressed by current treatment strategies. Given the primary involvement of the CNS, multiple neuroimaging studies have sought to characterize the structural and functional consequences of classic galactosemia. Findings in both adolescents and adults reveal widespread abnormalities, including white matter (WM) microstructure pathology, altered gray matter (GM) density, disrupted functional networks, and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Additionally, metabolic brain alterations have been suggested by a positron emission tomography study demonstrating abnormal glucose metabolism across multiple brain regions. These findings indicate that classic galactosemia affects brain structure and function on multiple levels, yet the precise mechanisms driving these abnormalities remain unclear.

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder… [^112sfLXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder usually relies on two main sources of information: parents' or caregivers' descriptions of their child's development and a professional's observation of the child's behavior.
- The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition provides standardized criteria to help diagnose ASD. Diagnostic Criteria for ASD The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition provides standardized criteria to help diagnose ASD. To meet diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-5, a child must have persistent deficits in each of three areas of social communication and interaction plus at least two of four types of restricted, repetitive behaviors.
- Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions
- Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.
- Level 3 – requires very substantial support
- Level 2 – Requires substantial support
- Level 1 – requires support
- Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech.

Note:

- Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social communication disorder.

### Neuroimaging for patients with dizziness who present to outpatient clinics vs EDs in the US… [^1136Y9rW]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Although the optimization of neuroimaging for dizziness has focused on the overuse of head CT scans in the ED, interventions are needed to promote guideline-concordant MRI and CT use in outpatient settings, where most dizziness presentations occur. Importance. A head CT scan provides false reassurance during evaluations for dizziness given its low sensitivity for posterior fossa infarcts compared with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. 10–12 Magnetic resonance imaging may also be falsely negative for small infarcts within 48 hours of onset. 13 Accordingly, radiologic guidelines recommend appropriately timed MRI vs CT scan for evaluating the central causes of dizziness or vertigo, and temporal bone CT scan vs head CT scan for labyrinthine dehiscence or erosion. 14, 15.

A head CT scan was used the most, followed by brain MRI, cerebrovascular USN, and magnetic resonance angiography. episodic or chronic than acute. 50 For example, less than 3% of brain MRI scans or CT angiography scans yielded new findings among outpatients with isolated dizziness, just over half of which altered management. 51 When patients also had abnormal vestibular testing results, 5. 5% of MRI scans yielded treatable causative lesions, and all had additional symptoms. 52 In our cohort, MRI was more often used after outpatient presentations than after ED presentations, potentially evidencing greater knowledge dissemination or implementation regarding MRI's diagnostic superiority and/or technology access.

Additional possible levers of influence on test-ordering behavior for patients with dizziness could include the incorporation of imaging into incentivized quality metrics and required clinical documentation for prior authorization. This finding further emphasizes that efforts to rightsize imaging use for dizziness should strongly consider appropriate MRI use during outpatient and post-ED care. Through clinician-, payer-, and policy-level interventions, avoidance of unnecessary imaging tests that are low yield and carry a risk could lower resource use and cost. There appears to be a particular opportunity to improve value by addressing the allowable indications for MRI use outside the ED. Future work should focus on creating a guideline-concordant, policy-supported clinical toolkit with interventions targeted at the time of initial presentation to improve care.

### Proton chemical shift imaging in developmental stuttering… [^117NEbVz]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Neuroimaging studies have reported effects of stuttering in widespread cortical, white matter, and subcortical regions. 4, 9–15 Our functional magnetic resonance imaging study16 found effects in circuits regulating motor activity, attention, and emotion. Herein we further explore the neurophysiology of stuttering using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used multiplanar chemical shift imaging MRS in an adult and pediatric sample of people with stuttering and nonstuttering control individuals. Multiplanar chemical shift imaging interrogates the brain using expansive multivoxel arrays, well suited for the widely distributed effects of stuttering. To our knowledge, this is the first MRS study of stuttering. It confirms widespread brain alterations.

The hypothesis-driven ROI approach detected below-normal NAA: Cr ratios in the right-hemisphere IFC, inferior frontal white matter, and caudate, and elevated Cho: Cr ratios in the bilateral STC, superior temporal white matter, thalamus, and left putamen. The Cho: Cr ratio was also altered in these regions. Most of these regions were loci of prior stuttering findings. The NAA: Cr and Cho: Cr ratio effects may represent imbalances in neuronal and glial density and metabolic activity, including membrane turnover. Regions affected contribute to subfunctions of speech, including rhythm and auditory pacing, feedforward motor planning, verbal monitoring and speech initiation, and coordination of speech musculature. Stuttering-related dysfunction in these structures may result from reduced impulse control, poor motor timing, and auditory feedback mismatch.

Some metabolite effects overlapped areas of altered activation in our fMRI study16 of stuttering in an overlapping sample, including the left FpC, right SFC, left lateral PC, left and right anterior middle cingulate cortex, right PCC, and right caudate; however, in other regions, effects did not overlap, perhaps in part because MPCSI was resting state and fMRI was task based. Thus, our MPCSI findings may reflect neurometabolic aberrations associated with many aspects of stuttering and speech production, possibly implicating circuits subserving regulation of motor activity, attention, and emotion explored in our fMRI study.
