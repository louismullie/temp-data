## Question

Active chest pain management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about active chest pain management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and ruling out life-threatening causes. Then, I should verify risk stratification frameworks and how they guide disposition. Next, I will examine diagnostic pathways for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, including the role of hs-cTn, ECG, and imaging. After that, I need to check guideline-directed medical therapy optimization and when to escalate to invasive evaluation. Finally, I will consider special populations, noncardiac causes, and systems-level implementation with shared decision-making and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and a 10-minute ECG to rapidly identify STEMI, NSTEMI, acute aortic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and pericarditis, because missing these is catastrophic; I should not delay reperfusion or antithrombotic therapy while waiting for labs if STEMI is suspected, and I need to ensure hemodynamic stability before proceeding down accelerated pathways [^113LeEw7] [^1158u1Hw] [^113xH9FF].

> Wait, let me verify the risk stratification framework before jumping to testing; the AHA/ACC recommends clinical decision pathways that categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk strata to determine disposition and next steps, with low risk defined as a 30-day risk of death or MACE less than 1 percent, which supports discharge without urgent testing when appropriate [^1144ozkh] [^116RFQAY] [^117FpDzx].

> For low-risk patients, I should double-check that a single hs-cTn at or beyond 3 hours from symptom onset, interpreted with a validated pathway, can safely exclude ACS; if negative and the ECG is nondiagnostic, discharge with return precautions and outpatient follow-up is reasonable, and I need to ensure I communicate uncertainty and provide decision aids to support shared decision-making and reduce low-value testing [^111LqwNY] [^1119ytAY] [^115JL5Ld].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of observation units for intermediate-risk patients; guidelines support observation unit care to shorten length of stay and reduce costs, and I should optimize GDMT before additional testing in those with known CAD, reserving CCTA or functional testing for selected cases where results will change management; I need to ensure I do not overuse stress testing when prior results already inform risk [^112BqyKF] [^117APduJ] [^113iXiqu].

> For high-risk patients, I need to ensure I do not delay invasive coronary angiography when indicated; persistent ischemia, dynamic ECG changes, or elevated troponin should trigger guideline-concordant antithrombotic therapy and early invasive evaluation, and I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary ACS pathways and local protocols [^115vaFyJ] [^111sLkhK].

> Next, I should review GDMT optimization because it is foundational across risk tiers; for obstructive CAD, I need to titrate anti-ischemics and preventive therapies including beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, high-intensity statins, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and antiplatelet therapy as indicated, and for nonobstructive CAD or elevated risk, I should emphasize lifestyle and preventive strategies; I should confirm dosing and contraindications at the bedside and reconcile medications before discharge [^114fmsd4] [^111PGEzk] [^113sDtPD].

> Let me consider special populations and noncardiac causes so I do not anchor on ACS; women and older adults more often present with atypical symptoms, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and use structured risk tools; for suspected pericarditis, NSAIDs and colchicine are first-line and I should avoid anticoagulation if tamponade is suspected; for myocarditis, supportive care and symptom control are key, and I should avoid NSAIDs if there is concern for myocardial injury; for musculoskeletal or anxiety-related chest pain, targeted therapy and reassurance can be effective and cost-saving [^1147PYnA] [^111ZVn29] [^112bxYmr] [^111Dfkbq].

> I should confirm systems-level implementation steps that improve safety and efficiency; embedding standardized CDPs, hs-cTn protocols, and order sets into the EMR, coupled with education and feedback, reduces unnecessary admissions and testing without increasing MACE, and I need to track 30-day returns and MACE to close the loop on quality [^114mtt85] [^112eKmws] [^1116tiwS].

> But wait, what if the patient insists on more testing despite low risk; I need to ensure shared decision-making by explaining the low event rate, radiation or procedural risks, and costs, and offer decision aids to align choices with values; this reduces anxiety-driven testing and improves satisfaction when patients understand trade-offs [^1119ytAY] [^115JL5Ld].

> Finally, I should double-check disposition and follow-up: low-risk patients can be discharged with clear return precautions and timely outpatient follow-up, intermediate-risk patients may benefit from observation with GDMT optimization and selective testing, and high-risk patients warrant admission and invasive evaluation; I need to ensure medication reconciliation, smoking cessation support, and cardiac rehabilitation referrals are arranged before discharge to close gaps in secondary prevention [^116RFQAY] [^112BqyKF] [^113sDtPD].

Active chest pain management centers on **rapid risk stratification** and **early decision-making** to identify life-threatening causes and guide safe disposition [^1144ozkh]. Use **clinical decision pathways** (CDPs) to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk, and apply high-sensitivity troponin protocols to rapidly exclude acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in low-risk patients [^116RFQAY] [^111LqwNY]. For low-risk patients, discharge without urgent testing is safe with appropriate follow-up and patient education [^116RFQAY] [^1119ytAY]. For intermediate-risk patients, observation units with selective testing (prefer CCTA) reduce length of stay and cost without compromising safety [^112BqyKF] [^111oSzi6]. For high-risk patients, initiate guideline-directed medical therapy and proceed to invasive evaluation [^115vaFyJ]. Always address noncardiac causes, use shared decision-making, and ensure close follow-up to minimize missed ACS and reduce unnecessary admissions [^1124AX9d] [^115JL5Ld].

---

## Initial assessment and risk stratification

- **Immediate evaluation**: Obtain a focused history, vital signs, and a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival [^1158u1Hw] [^112C5SGG].

- **Risk stratification**: Use validated CDPs (e.g. HEART, EDACS, TIMI) to categorize patients as low, intermediate, or high risk for ACS [^1144ozkh] [^116GLb8x].

- **High-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn)**: Use hs-cTn assays with 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour protocols to rapidly exclude ACS in low-risk patients [^111LqwNY] [^1116tiwS].

---

## Management of low-risk patients

- **Disposition**: Patients with a 30-day MACE risk < 1% can be discharged without urgent cardiac testing [^116RFQAY] [^117FpDzx].

- **Patient education**: Provide clear return precautions and arrange close follow-up within 72 hours [^notfound].

- **Shared decision-making**: Use decision aids to improve patient understanding and reduce low-value testing [^1119ytAY] [^115JL5Ld].

---

## Management of intermediate-risk patients

- **Observation units**: Manage in observation units to reduce length of stay and cost without compromising safety [^112BqyKF] [^114yLT3N].

- **Diagnostic testing**: Prefer coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for its rapid diagnosis, shorter stay, and similar safety compared with stress testing [^111oSzi6] [^1158u1Hw].

- **Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)**: Optimize GDMT before additional testing in patients with known CAD [^113iXiqu] [^113ySfzM].

---

## Management of high-risk patients

High-risk patients require **immediate admission**, initiation of GDMT, and early invasive coronary angiography when indicated [^115vaFyJ] [^111sLkhK]. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect arrhythmias or ischemia, and early cardiology consultation should be obtained to guide management and intervention [^notfound].

---

## Addressing noncardiac causes

Noncardiac etiologies — such as pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericarditis, and musculoskeletal pain — should be actively considered and appropriately evaluated [^1124AX9d] [^117Nz4dk]. Provide **targeted therapy** — NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pain, anticoagulation for PE, and surgical consultation for aortic dissection — as indicated [^116yLNyX].

---

## Special populations and considerations

Women and elderly patients may present **atypically**; maintain a high index of suspicion and use CDPs appropriately [^1147PYnA] [^111mSWtY]. Patients with known CAD should have GDMT optimized before additional testing, and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease require individualized risk assessment and management [^113iXiqu] [^1158u1Hw].

---

## Follow-up and secondary prevention

Arrange **close follow-up** within 72 hours for low-risk patients to reassess symptoms and risk [^notfound]. Emphasize lifestyle modification — smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and weight management — and ensure adherence to GDMT [^113sDtPD]. Educate patients on symptom recognition and when to seek immediate care [^notfound].

---

## Quality improvement and system-level interventions

Implement **standardized CDPs** and embed them into the EMR to improve adherence and reduce variability [^114mtt85]. Provide ongoing education and feedback to clinicians on adherence to pathways and outcomes [^114mtt85]. Track metrics such as time to ECG, hs-cTn turnaround, discharge rates, and 30-day MACE to drive improvement [^notfound].

---

Active chest pain management relies on **rapid risk stratification**, evidence-based pathways, and early decision-making to balance safety, efficiency, and cost. By using CDPs, hs-cTn protocols, and selective imaging, clinicians can safely reduce unnecessary admissions and testing while identifying high-risk patients who need urgent intervention.

Conclusions

Rapid discharge in patients with low-risk chest pain is acceptable to patients, but clinicians reported some reticence in implementing the LoDED discharge strategy. Key factors in the successful implementation of rapid discharge strategies are likely to be (1) taking the time to discuss what it means to be 'low-risk', (2) acknowledging and explaining diagnostic ambiguity to patients and (3) improved verbal and written information provision.

### Clinical transformation through change management case study: chest pain in the emergency department [^114mtt85]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Background

Adults with chest pain presenting to an emergency department are high-risk and high-volume. A methodology which gathers practicing physicians together to review evidence and share practice experience to formulate a written algorithm with key decision points and measures is discussed with implementation, based on change management principles, and results.

Methods

A methodology was followed to "establish the standard-of-care". Literature and data were reviewed, a written consensus algorithm was designed with ability to track adherence and deviations. We performed a before and after analysis of a performance improvement intervention in adult patients with undifferentiated chest pain in our nine-campus hospital system in Florida between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2018.

Results

A total of 200,691 patients were identified as adults with chest pain and the algorithm was used. A dramatic change in the disposition decision rate was noted. When the 'Baseline-Year' was compared with the 'Performance-Year', chest pain patients discharged from the ED increased by 99%, those going to the 'Observation' status decreased by 20%, and inpatient admissions decreased by 63% (p < 0.0001) All patients were tracked for 30-days for major adverse cardiac event (MACE) or return to the ED within the same system. If the s emergency physicians had not changed their practice/behavior and the Baseline-Year decision rate during the entire Performance-Year was unchanged, then 4563 more patients would have gone to Observation and 7986 patients to Inpatient. The opportunity costs avoided would be approximately $31million (US$.

Conclusions

For successful clinical transformation through change management, we learned: select strategic topics, get active physicians together, write a consensus algorithm with freedom to deviate, identify and remove barriers, communicate vision, pilot with feedback, implement, sustain by "hard wiring" into the electronic medical record and measure outputs.

### Care models for acute chest pain that improve outcomes and efficiency: JACC state-of-the-art review [^113cr8gX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Existing assessment pathways for acute chest pain are often resource-intensive, prolonged, and expensive. In this review, the authors describe existing chest pain pathways and current issues at the patient and system level, and provide an overview of recent advances in chest pain research that could inform improved outcomes for both patients and health systems. There are multiple avenues to improve existing models of chest pain care, including novel risk stratification pathways incorporating highly sensitive point-of-care troponin assays; new devices available before first medical contact that could allow clinicians to access vital signs and electrocardiogram data; artificial intelligence and precision medicine tools that may guide indications for further testing; and strategies to improve hospital benchmarking and performance monitoring to standardize care. Improving the speed and accuracy of chest pain diagnosis and management should be a priority for researchers and is likely to translate to substantive benefits for patients and health systems.

### Economic outcomes with precision diagnostic testing versus usual testing in stable chest pain: results from the PRECISE randomized trial [^114QX3rD]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

A Markov microsimulation model based on patient-level data from the PROMISE trial found that over a lifetime horizon, the cCTA strategy improved life expectancy by 6 months and reduced late ICA and revascularization procedures after 5 years. These results were driven primarily by assumptions of long-term benefits associated with increased statin use observed in the cCTA arm of PROMISE. Compared with functional testing over the lifetime horizon, the model estimated that a strategy of cCTA in low-risk stable patients with chest pain would be economically dominant (increased quality-adjusted life years and lower cost).

Increasing the rate of PCI in stable patients with chest pain based primarily on anatomic severity supplemented by evidence of ischemic physiology might be regarded as an undesirable feature of a diagnostic strategy, given that PCI in stable CAD has not proven clearly prognostically beneficial. However, the large trials comparing PCI with medical therapy have actually compared a routine invasive strategy (with about 90% receiving PCI in the ISCHEMIA trial [International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches] invasive arm) with a selective invasive strategy (with about 30% receiving PCI in the ISCHEMIA trial conservative arm). Thus, every large trial testing the prognostic effects of PCI has assumed that some moderate rate of PCI is necessary even with a conservative strategy centered on the use of prognostically active medical therapies. Patients in PRECISE who have both active symptoms and evidence on cCTA of obstructive CAD with ischemic physiology may, in fact, represent the appropriate group to receive PCI for symptom management in the context of a conservative management strategy.

### Benefits outweigh the risks: a consensus statement on the risks of physical activity for people living with long-term conditions [^1125WyWk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac chest pain

The long-term benefits of increasing regular physical activity far outweigh the temporary, slight increased risk of adverse events even in those experiencing exertional chest pain as a result of ischaemic heart disease (angina). This risk increases with advancing age and exercise intensity, but overall remains very low. People should be counselled individually to gradually increase physical activity, taking into account severity of symptoms and fear of cardiac chest pain. Exercise is a good treatment option for stable angina to stimulate angiogenesis. However, increasing frequency and severity of angina should prompt a medical review with no further increase in physical activity.

In the 6 weeks after an acute cardiac event or cardiac surgery, all physical activity advice should be delivered by specialist services and outside of this document's scope. There is an increased risk of an acute cardiac event in previously sedentary individuals with known cardiovascular disease who undertake unaccustomed vigorous intensity exercise. The increased risk is present both during the activity and for 1–2 hours afterwards. However, the absolute risk of a cardiovascular event during physical activity is very low. The incidence of sudden cardiac death has been reported as 1 in every 1.5 million episodes of vigorous physical activity in menand every 36.5 million hours of moderate/vigorous exertion in women. Reports suggest a 6–17 times increased risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death during vigorous-intensity physical activity, compared with being sedentary. This risk reduces as physical activity levels are increased and cardiovascular fitness improves. It is essential that levels of physical activity are increased gradually.

### Recent innovations, modifications, and evolution of ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines: an update for our constituencies: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116oR4Zy]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA guideline gaps and commissioned topics — Current ACC/AHA guidelines cover 8 broad topics and consist of > 20 guidelines. Two perceived gaps are being addressed: chest pain, a condition that requires evaluation in > 7 million people each year, for which a dedicated guideline on the evaluation of chest pain, both in the office/clinic setting and in the emergency department, was commissioned and includes writing committee members from numerous medical stakeholders; and cardiovascular disease prevention, for which there is a need for a comprehensive guideline specifically on the approach to cardiovascular disease prevention that was thus commissioned, is intended to be concise enough to be readable in one sitting, and will consolidate key recommendations on assessment of cardiovascular risk, smoking cessation, exercise and physical activity, diet and nutrition, obesity and weight loss, diabetes mellitus management, aspirin use, and key primary prevention recommendations on high blood pressure and blood cholesterol.

### Key recommendations and evidence from the NICE guideline for the acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^115VeY6i]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has seen significant changes in the past decade. Although the incidence has been declining in the UK, STEMI still gives rise to around 600 hospitalised episodes per million people each year, with many additional cases resulting in death before hospital admission. In-hospital mortality following acute coronary syndromes has fallen over the past 30 years from around 20% to nearer 5%, and this improved outcome has been attributed to various factors, including timely access to an expanding range of effective interventional and pharmacological treatments. A formal review of the acute management of STEMI is therefore appropriate. The recently published NICE clinical guideline (CG167: The acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation) provides evidence-based guidance on the acute management of STEMI, including the choice of reperfusion strategies, procedural aspects of the recommended interventions, the use of additional drugs before and longside reperfusion therapies, and the treatment of patients who are unconscious or in cardiogenic shock. The guideline development methods and detailed reviews of the evidence considered by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) can be found in the full version of the guideline (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG167), and the priority recommendations are summarised in box 1. Other related NICE clinical guidelines deal with the diagnosis of recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin http://www.nice.org.uk/CG95), the early management of unstable angina and non-STEMI (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG94), and secondary prevention after myocardial infarction (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG48, currently being updated with publication expected end of 2013).

### State of the art: evaluation and medical management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113sDtPD]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic therapies — nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA): The 2021 Multisociety Chest Pain Guideline states, "For patients with known NOCA and stable chest pain, it is recommended to optimize preventive therapies". Nonpharmacologic therapies "should include dietary interventions and increased physical activity, as well as weight loss and tobacco cessation, when appropriate", and the 2019 ACC/AHA guideline "recommends a diet emphasizing intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and fish to decrease risk factors". Physical activity guidance is "150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity per week plus resistance training at least 2 times a week", with the note that "there is no lower limit, and being more physically active is important for everyone". For smokers, "tobacco cessation has substantial benefits, with an impact far greater than that of most other pharmacologic therapies", and "all smokers should be counseled on the importance of quitting and be offered various interventions that may assist in smoking cessation". Other lifestyle measures include improving sleep duration "(7–9 hours per night)" and quality, and stress management.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

This clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing randomized and nonrandomized trials, observational studies, registries, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered.

Structure

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The "2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain" provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. This guideline presents an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated, and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112bxYmr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment of myocarditis — chest pain management — notes limited evidence and conditional symptomatic therapy for pericardial-type presentations. The text states "There is not a robust database guiding the treatment of chest pain in myocarditis or myocarditis with associated pericarditis", and that "Pericardial-type chest pain with normal or low normal LVEF can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and weight-adjusted colchicine". It also reports that "murine models raised concern about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in myocarditis".

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^113QoPtW]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST methodology — selection and prioritization criteria for guideline topics and updates state that the criteria in this table are used to select and prioritize topics for development or revisions, and in the LGM, approval of topics for de novo development and prioritization of guideline updates requires meeting most of the criteria in Table 1. Criteria include changes in the relevance of a clinical question to the practice of medicine, changes in available interventions (eg, new drugs or devices), changes in evidence on the existing benefits and harms of interventions, changes in outcomes considered important, changes in values placed on outcomes, changes in evidence that current practice is optimal, changes in resources available for health care, and changes of strategic importance to CHEST; the narrow scope with specific key clinical questions broken down into PICO elements permits readers to quickly understand the clinical content areas, patient populations, and interventions addressed.

Prior moderate-to-severe ischemia on previous stress testing — acute chest pain management: In patients with evidence of moderate or severe ischemia on prior stress testing who were not revascularized and now present with acute chest pain, additional noninvasive stress testing is unlikely to result in any change in management, and such patients can proceed directly to an invasive evaluation if coronary revascularization aligns with care goals; symptomatic patients with inconclusive or mildly abnormal stress tests often have an increased risk of MACE, and patients with previous stress testing often have atherosclerotic plaque and are at risk for obstructive CAD lesions.

Known CAD with stable chest pain — initial management emphasis — In patients with known CAD, clinicians should opt to intensify GDMT first, if there is an opportunity to do so, and defer testing. Although GDMT exists for obstructive CAD, there are no current guidelines that are specific to nonobstructive CAD; thus, adhering to atherosclerotic CV prevention guidelines is recommended. ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of patients with stable CAD recommend optimization of anti-ischemic and preventive therapies with the goal to reduce the patient's angina burden and improve clinical outcomes, and for all patients with a history of CAD risk factors, optimized preventive therapy should be used according to ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines.

Effects of pain on physical activity in obesity

Obesity is associated with comorbidities and discomforts that can negatively affect psychological well-being and perceptions about staying physically active. These include heart disease and heart failure, fibromyalgia, asthma, gout, diabetes, anxiety, and depression. Increased muscle effort can trigger physical discomforts such as dyspnea, chest pain, muscle fatigue, and psychological discomforts such as stigma, fear of falling, and low self-efficacy.–This is problematic for practitioners and those affected because physical activity and exercise are main tenets of weight management programs and long-term health.

Both obese children and adults experience pain symptoms most frequently in the axial and load-bearing segments of the body such as the neck, low back, and lower limb. Chronic joint pain can also occur in the non-weight-bearing joints of the upper body such as the shoulder and hand, and in the facets of the lumbar spine. Obese persons suffer from multisite pain, and morbidly obese are over twice as likely to report consistent, severe pain symptoms than normal weight individuals. Longitudinal evidence shows that high BMI precedes and independently predicts foot joint painand knee pain.

Chest pain is the second leading reason for emergency department (ED) visits in the United States, with an estimated annual cost upwards of 5 billion dollars. 1 While up to 20% of patients may have a cardiac cause of their chest pain, few have life‐threatening conditions and the majority are ultimately diagnosed with noncardiac pain. 2 Despite the low incidence of mortality and morbidity, patients presenting to EDs with chest pain historically have had among the largest variations in hospital admission rates, largely driven by guideline recommendations to secure objective cardiac testing for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) before or within 72 hours of hospital discharge. 3, 4, 5, 6 This recommendation has been repeatedly challenged in light of evidence that only 1% to 4% of patients without diagnostic ECGs and/or cardiac biomarkers have angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery disease. 7, 8, 9 Accordingly, a recent clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians has recommended against routine objective cardiac testing in the ED for patients at low risk for ACS. 10

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### Symptom management strategies used by older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity and a high symptom burden-a qualitative study [^1126noFR]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

To use facilitating techniques

One active strategy used by participants to ease the pain or tingling in hands or feet was different types of physical activities. When pain struck, they described it as impossible to lay down or keep still and that moving around to get the circulation going was the best option. The physical activities could involve walking, spinning/cycling or doing squats. Other techniques were to sit up and do breathing exercises in order to get more oxygen into the system.

"When I get this pain in my chest and back, I cannot go and lie down, that will only make it worse. I'll often try to do breathing exercises" (P2).

Participants also used massage, warm socks at night, bandages, breathing exercises, TENS, relaxation, and to lie down in a specific position to ease the pain.

"Well I figured that, if I rub really hard at this area (over the ankle) it gets warm, and then somehow things seems to loosen up a bit, and the pain goes away" (P3).

To relieve symptoms of a dry mouth or from the gastrointestinal tract, they tried gargling water, excluded various foods, and tested different non-prescription drugs from the pharmacy.

Most of these exercises and methods they had learned from friends and family or through trial and error.

Passive strategies

The participants sometimes felt they had no choice when managing symptoms other than to passively give in or to endure. The participants employing this symptom management strategy could not describe the source of their symptom, they often referred to it as " no one knows, it's "just the way it is " or " the body is just totally worn out ".

### Acute pericarditis: diagnosis and management… [^111ZVn29]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION In more than 95% of cases, patients with acute pericarditis present with acute retrosternal, sharp, pleuritic chest pain that varies in severity. 10 The pain may radiate into the neck, jaw, or arms, similar to an MI. In contrast to the pain from myocardial ischemia, chest pain from acute pericarditis is exacerbated in the supine position, by coughing, and with inspiration. The pain usually improves in the seated position or by leaning forward, which reduces pressure on the parietal pericardium, but it is not relieved with nitrates. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed to exclude a pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. An observational study with aspirin and gastroprotection showed a resolution rate of 87% with follow-up for 38 months.

6 Tapering will decrease the risk of recurrences and should be guided by symptoms and inflammatory markers. 22 Patients should limit strenuous activities until they are pain free and their biomarkers have normalized. 22 Gastroprotection should be used in appropriate patients while they are taking NSAIDs. 23 European guidelines also suggest colchicine as a possible initial treatment choice for acute pericarditis. 7 In one prospective, randomized, open-label study, patients with acute pericarditis received conventional treatment plus colchicine or conventional treatment alone. Patients who received colchicine had a significantly lower recurrence rate at 18 months and symptom persistence at 72 hours. 24 When combined with an NSAID, colchicine decreased symptoms, decreased rate of recurrence, and was better tolerated than an NSAID alone.

These findings were confirmed in a subsequent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which colchicine or placebo was added to conventional therapy in patients with acute pericarditis. Colchicine was given at a dosage of 0. 5 mg twice daily for three months in patients weighing more than 154 lb or
0. 5 mg once daily in patients weighing 154 lb or less.

### National Institute for Health and Care Excellence updates the stable chest pain guideline with radical changes to the diagnostic paradigm [^111Srmm6]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

In the 2016 update of the stable chest pain guideline, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made radical changes to the diagnostic paradigm that it-like other international guidelines-had previously placed at the centre of its recommendations. No longer are quantitative assessments of the disease probability considered necessary to determine the need for diagnostic testing and the choice of test. Instead, the recommendation is for no diagnostic testing if chest pain is judged to be 'non-anginal' and CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with 'typical' or 'atypical' chest pain with additional perfusion imaging only if there is uncertainty about the functional significance of coronary lesions. The new emphasis on anatomical-as opposed to functional-testing is driven in large part by cost-effectiveness analysis and despite inevitable resource implications NICE calculates that annual savings for the population of England will be significant. In making CTCA the default diagnostic testing strategy in its updated chest pain guideline, NICE has responded emphatically to calls from trialists for CTCA to have a greater role in the diagnostic pathway of patients with suspected angina.

### Physiotherapy and cystic fibrosis: what is the evidence base? [^112iut9m]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a comprehensive overview and evidence to support the role of physiotherapy in the management of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) including airway clearance, exercise, and musculoskeletal concerns which can affect activities of daily living and respiratory health.

Recent Findings

Several long-term studies have looked at the efficacy of airway clearance techniques, including active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, high frequency chest wall oscillation, postural drainage, positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and oscillating PEP. Each of these studies reported some efficacy of airway clearance in maintaining health with no one technique being superior to another. However, one study suggested that high frequency chest wall oscillation was not as effective as PEP in maintaining health in CF patients. Individual preference needs to be considered when selecting a technique. Recent studies have found exercise to increase mucociliary clearance peripherally. Musculoskeletal issues, including posture, bone density, urinary incontinence, and pain should be assessed and managed in individuals to improve the mechanics of breathing and overall well-being.

Summary

The role of physiotherapy in CF is complex and includes airway clearance, exercise, and management of the long-term sequelae of musculoskeletal issues. More rigorous physiotherapy studies are required to assist with evidence based practice.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^114iEzgA]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment: current guidelines

Assessment strategies in current major international guidelines focus on the detection of underlying obstructive CAD. European and American guidelines (ESC and ACC/AHA, respectively) favour a Bayesian approach whereby overall probability of obstructive CAD after testing is determined from pretest probability modified by the diagnostic test results. The ACC/AHA guidelines determine pretest risk from a modified Diamond Forrester model, whereas the Europeans favour the CADC (Coronary Artery Disease Consortium) model which avoids overestimation seen with Diamond-Forrester and appears a more accurate assessment of pretest risk. Both current guidelines stratify pretest risk into low, intermediate or high groups with use of non-invasive testing suggested in the intermediate group (ACC/AHA arbitrarily defined as 10%–90% or 15%–85% in ESC).

In stark contrast, the NICE CG95 2016 update 'chest pain of recent onset: assessment and diagnosis' discarded the Bayesian pretest risk assessment. NICE advocates first-line multidetector CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in all patients with typical or atypical chest pain (box 1), those whose history does not suggest angina but who have ST changes or Q waves on a resting ECG. Functional testing (eg, exercise stress echo or stress perfusion magnetic resonance — CMR) are relegated to second-line if CTCA is non-diagnostic or the clinical significance of known CAD needs clarified. Potential benefits of this approach include a much higher diagnostic accuracy for detection of atherosclerotic heart disease than functional testing which potentially carries the best long-term prognostic information for patients with CAD. Extended 5-year outcomes from SCOTHEART showed a reduction in the combined endpoint of death from coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction among the group randomised to CTCA compared with standard care (2.3% vs 3.9%; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.6% number needed to treat (NNT) 63). This effect was driven by better targeting of preventative therapies. The authors report that although overall prescriptions of preventive cardiovascular medications were only modestly increased (~10% higher) in the CTCA arm, changes in such therapies occurred in around one in four patients allowing more personalised treatment to patients with most coronary atheroma in the CT group.

### Cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care versus self-management in patients with musculoskeletal chest pain [^111Dfkbq]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

This study was designed as a pragmatic trial with a 12-month follow-up period that was conducted in the real-life context of a large university hospital in Denmark and four community-based chiropractic practices, which strengthens the external validity of our results. The main contributor to the lower cost of the chiropractor care group was the lower rate of hospitalisation in that group. We are not able to elucidate why, but psychological factors frequently influence healthcare-seeking generally and have been suggested in chest pain patients specifically. In particular, fear of activities that cause physical (somatic) sensation with normal activities and 'normal' discomfort (interoceptive fear) are an important factor in understanding the persistent medical-seeking behaviours of some patients with NSCP. We suggest that the key factors in the success of the chiropractic care were the close contact with a primary healthcare provider, who targeted unmet distress, the consideration of psychological and physical factors together, and the neurological and analgesic effect of manual therapy. In any case, it is clear that offering a series of consultations with a musculoskeletal healthcare provider may have positive economic implications that are not achieved when patients are left to manage their condition on their own.

NSCP is defined as the absence of coronary disease and is not a unitary diagnosis but contains a number of diverse subgroups. Patients with NSCP may have evidence of gastro-oesophageal, musculoskeletal, psychiatric or psychological abnormalities, and signs of one or more co-occurring conditions. It has been argued that the ability to provide adequate care is limited by a lack of information on the characteristics of patients with NSCP. By means of a systematic clinical assessment of this patient group, we were able to identify a subset of patients with suspected musculoskeletal chest pain, and we have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of a safe and low-tech management strategy for this specific patient group. Considering the large number of people with NSCP, a recommendation in future clinical guidelines of primary care treatment for musculoskeletal chest pain from clinicians, such as chiropractors or similar professions, could result in considerable savings to societies, provided that a multifaceted, person-centred approach was used. In our clinical trial, that comprehensive approach included manual treatment, exercises and advice targeting both psychosocial and biomechanical aspects of chest pain. Future research should evaluate the generalisability of our results to other settings, look into understanding the potentially multifactorial causes of NSCP and recognise the potential for multiple coexisting and potentially mutually reinforcing causes, in diagnosis and treatment.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Attempt to perform 12-lead ECG in patients with chest pain within 10 minutes of arrival to a clinic or emergency setting.
- Use a clinical decision pathway to identify patients with low-risk chest pain who can be discharged from the emergency department.
- If available, use CCTA preferentially over stress testing for patients with intermediate-risk chest pain to determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. For patients with high-risk chest pain, provide referral for invasive coronary angiography. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology updated guidelines for management of chest pain, which are endorsed by five other cardiology groups. The guidelines provide new recommendations on what to consider chest pain and when to avoid testing in patients at low risk, and they endorse use of published decision pathways to determine the order and extent of workup.

Exercise can be used for any patient who is not frail and can achieve at least five metabolic equivalents, which is required to do many activities of daily living. Patients who cannot meet both requirements should receive pharmacologic stress testing. Exercise ECG testing should be avoided in patients with ECG findings of 0. 5-mm ST depression, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or digitalis use. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay.

Intermediate-risk patients with known CAD and acute chest pain should have blood pressure and cholesterol management maximized before additional testing. CCTA can document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. Patients with a history of high-risk CAD or worsening frequency of symptoms who have optimized blood pressure and cholesterol management should be evaluated with invasive coronary angiography. High-risk patients with acute chest pain should receive invasive coronary angiography. In patients with suspected ischemia despite no obstructive cardiac disease, positron emission tomography, cardiovascular MRI, or angiography may help tailor medical therapy to improve quality of life, although they have not been demonstrated to reduce future cardiac events.

### Reducing avoidable chest pain admissions and implementing high-sensitivity troponin testing [^112eKmws]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Strategy

Our baseline measurements correspond to the first cycle of our plan, do, study, act (PDSA) strategy, which informed the subsequent phases of our QIP. We used interim data collection to measure and inform further interventions.

PDSA cycle 1

The aim in PDSA 1 was to assess and then address the quality of chest pain assessment in A&E and to correlate this to relevant guidance. Comparing performance to national guidance could then be presented to key stakeholders (doctors, nurses and patient flow coordinators) to enact behaviour change. The appropriate standard in assessing chest pain (NICE CG95) was identified. This guided the measurements for the baseline audit. Data were collected from patients presenting to the A&E department of WMUH in November 2016. The analysis of this data highlighted specific learning points and areas of improvement, which were disseminated in educational presentations to A&E and acute physicians. Feedback about the challenges physicians faced when making early decisions was also obtained during these sessions.

PDSA cycle 2

In PDSA cycle 2, we aimed to act on feedback obtained from key stakeholders in PDSA 1. In addition to sustaining improvements from the previous cycle, we hypothesised we could further improve compliance with NICE guidance by creating new chest pain pathways. The strategy for change here was to further encourage A&E staff to consider NICE guidance by referring patients for outpatient investigations.

We performed a focused interim audit of chest pain referrals to measure the impact of these educational sessions. The results showed that a higher proportion of patients admitted fulfilled the NICE criteria, and avoidable admission rates fell by 15%. Based on the interim audit results and physician feedback, we noted that some patients admitted for angina could be managed as outpatients. These results were used in meetings to plan and create an additional outpatient chest pain pathway: the RACP clinic.

Pain management

Surgery on the chest is one of the most painful of surgical procedures for both open and minimally invasive approaches. The key to enabling early recovery and ambulation is ensuring that postoperative pain is well controlled. Pain after thoracic surgery is generated from multiple structures and is transmitted via several afferent pathways. Factors that affect pain postoperatively can be divided into patient factors, analgesic technique, and operative approach. Effective pain control can facilitate a reduction in postoperative complication, particularly postoperative pulmonary complication. Thoracic epidurals were introduced into clinical practice for post-thoracotomy analgesia in the mid-1970s and have become the gold standard of post-thoracotomy analgesia since the mid-1990s.

The pathogenesis of post-thoracotomy pain is complex. Nociceptive receptors are stimulated by the skin incision, division and retraction of the muscles, and retraction and sometimes fracture of ribs. In addition, ligaments may be stretched, costochondral joints dislocated, and intercostal nerves injured, causing further pain. The incised pleura is frequently irritated by partial surgical stripping, chest drains, and residual pleural blood; the resulting inflammatory responses activate further nociceptors. The central transmission of these multiple nociceptive signals amplifies pain transmission and increases pain perception through central sensitization.

### Active CAD and chest pain relief with nitroglycerin… [^116rg1hM]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason for hospital admission. In most patients with chest pain, acute coronary artery disease is the major concern. Nitrates often are used in emergency treatment of acute chest pain, but relief with nitrates is an uncertain diagnostic and prognostic sign. Because nitro-glycerin can relieve symptoms of noncardiac chest pain, including esophageal spasm, its value as a tool in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease is questionable. Henrikson and associates conducted a prospective study to determine the usefulness of chest pain response to nitroglycerin as an indicator of ischemic coronary disease. Patients who had documented chest pain while under medical supervision were given nitroglycerin. A chest pain response to the first dose of nitroglycerin was defined as a 50 percent or greater decrease in pain intensity within five minutes of nitroglycerin administration. The presence of active CAD was determined for all participants.

Active CAD was defined as elevated troponin levels, abnormal angiography, a positive stress test, or diagnosis at the time of hospital admission that was confirmed by a study cardiologist. Follow-up telephone calls were made to all participants approximately four months after hospitalization to determine clinical status. Of the total study sample of 459 patients, 181 patients had relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin. In patients with chest pain that likely was caused by active CAD, 35 percent had pain relief with nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin also reduced chest pain in 41 percent of the patients without active CAD. Both sensitivity and specificity of chest pain relief by nitroglycerin as a predictor of active CAD were low in the study group as a whole and in the subgroups. Chest pain relief also did not predict outcomes. The authors conclude that in an emergency setting, chest pain relief with nitro-glycerin lacks diagnostic or prognostic value for acute CAD.

These findings possibly could be applied to most outpatient settings. In an editorial in the same journal, Gibbons questions the external validity of the findings by noting that response to nitroglycerin has different physiologies in patients with acute chest pain and in those with chronic stable angina who have myocardial ischemia. He points out that the evidence supporting the predictive value of response to nitroglycerin in the chronic setting is strong. Gibbons concludes that the study findings may be legitimate in the acute setting, but that nitrate responsiveness is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients with chronic stable chest pain.

For clinicians, statements include "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences" and "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients, and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. Decision aids may well be useful helping individuals making decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision". For policy makers, it notes "The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations including for the use as performance indicators" and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### The chest pain center in the emergency department [^1169VBxF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the improvement of medical treatment for acute coronary syndromes throughout the 20th century, the authors believe that many cases of life-threatening coronary events could be avoided through early detection of CAD and the use of preventive strategies. Establishing chest pain units that are linked to the ED is one excellent strategy to risk-stratify patients with symptoms who are at risk for sustaining an AMI or having lethal arrhythmias. There is a need for more research on chest pain units to determine the value for cost and to further optimize strategies for ACI detection and screening. In EDs with high volumes of chest pain patients, or high pressures to avoid hospital admissions, a planned, systematic, and rapid approach to the treatment of AMI and the diagnosis of chest pain is a rewarding necessity.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.
