## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiovascular disease prevention and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework for primary prevention. Then, I should verify risk assessment tools and thresholds. Next, I will examine lifestyle interventions, followed by pharmacologic strategies for cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. After that, I need to check special populations and controversies like aspirin and blood pressure targets. Finally, I will integrate implementation, adherence, and emerging precision medicine themes, and close with a concise, actionable synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: primary prevention centers on a patient-centered, team-based approach anchored in shared decision-making and attention to social determinants of health, with lifestyle as the cornerstone across the lifespan, which is repeatedly emphasized in the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline and its executive summaries [^116jPjSd] [^1135p1LP] [^1154Wfh7].

> I need to verify risk assessment methodology. For adults 40–75 years, routine calculation of 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations is recommended, with consideration of risk enhancers and, when borderline or intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium to refine decisions; for adults 20–39, reassessing risk factors every 4–6 years is reasonable, and I should double-check that these are Class I recommendations with strong evidence backing [^1171i962] [^1135p1LP] [^116jPjSd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds. I initially thought the statin benefit threshold universally begins at ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk, but wait, I should confirm the nuance: the ACC/AHA guideline supports statin therapy after a clinician–patient risk discussion for those at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%), and for high risk (≥ 20%) a stronger recommendation applies; importantly, diabetes in adults 40–75 years warrants statin therapy regardless of calculated risk, and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL mandates high-intensity statins, so I need to correct my earlier oversimplification [^111CzrrQ] [^115mxs3h] [^114Vu9ZA].

> Next, I should review lifestyle interventions, since they are first-line and often sufficient in early hypertension or elevated cholesterol. Let me consider the pillars: diet patterns such as DASH or Mediterranean, sodium restriction, weight management, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, smoking cessation with behavioral support and pharmacotherapy, and alcohol moderation; I should confirm that these are guideline-endorsed and that adherence is typically suboptimal, necessitating structured counseling and follow-up [^116gfPwC] [^116jPjSd] [^116M8hNM].

> I will now examine cholesterol management. Statins are first-line and dosed by intensity to achieve relative LDL-C reductions: ≥ 50% for high-intensity and 30–49% for moderate-intensity; if LDL-C remains above threshold despite maximally tolerated statin, adding ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable, and I should emphasize that thresholds are not rigid goals but decision points within shared decision-making, especially for very high-risk patients [^113Loper] [^111k11S8] [^1147bDQZ].

> Let me think about blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic therapy is foundational, and pharmacotherapy is indicated for stage 1 hypertension with ASCVD risk ≥ 10% or for stage 2 hypertension; I should confirm that the 2021 Lancet individual participant data meta-analysis supports blood pressure lowering across the spectrum, including those with baseline BP < 140 mmHg, arguing for a risk-based rather than purely threshold-based approach, though guidelines still operationalize categories for clinical use [^116gfPwC] [^114afJ9F].

> But wait, what about blood pressure targets in established CVD? The Cochrane reviews suggest no clear mortality benefit and more adverse effects with lower targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) versus standard targets, so I should avoid over-aggressive lowering in this subgroup and individualize to tolerance and comorbidity, keeping in mind that absolute risk reduction remains the key driver [^115xdVCE] [^113QhbJd].

> For diabetes, I should confirm the shift to an event-driven strategy. Metformin remains first-line, but in patients with established ASCVD or high risk, add a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit or an SGLT2 inhibitor with heart failure and kidney benefits; I need to ensure I cite the consensus statements that operationalize this approach and note the emphasis on comprehensive risk factor control alongside glycemia [^111ff9Qb] [^115ds7BJ].

> Now, I should review aspirin for primary prevention. Historically considered for those with ≥ 10% 10-year risk, but hold on, I should verify contemporary guidance: recent large RCTs show little to no benefit and increased bleeding, so aspirin should generally not be used for primary prevention except in select higher-risk adults 40–70 years after a careful risk–benefit discussion and shared decision-making; I need to ensure I distinguish this from secondary prevention where aspirin remains indicated [^112E294o] [^1176By5P] [^112evdqi].

> Let me consider special populations and implementation. Women have unique risk enhancers and historically lower adherence, so I should tailor counseling and consider sex-specific risk enhancers; older adults require careful attention to frailty, falls, and polypharmacy; patients with cancer need cardio-oncology principles to balance oncologic benefit against cardiotoxicity; and across all groups, adherence and persistence are poor, so team-based care, simplified regimens, and digital or pharmacist-led interventions can mitigate gaps [^1154Q5hn] [^115NumMC] [^11527fLg].

> I should double-check emerging themes. Precision medicine moves beyond one-size-fits-all to integrate clinical, imaging, and genomic data, with pharmacogenomics informing drug selection and dosing; however, I need to emphasize that most tools remain adjunctive and require integration with guideline-based care and shared decision-making rather than replacing it [^115bzEPo] [^114V3uwJ] [^116tnLME].

> Next, I should review implementation levers. Clinical decision support can reduce missed opportunities but must be thoughtfully designed to avoid alert fatigue; patient education improves adherence and outcomes, particularly when multi-modal and sustained; and addressing social determinants — food insecurity, transportation, health literacy — is essential to equitable risk reduction and must be embedded in routine workflows [^11527fLg] [^113gmECH] [^116jPjSd].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a 55-year-old woman with LDL-C 130 mg/dL, BP 138/88 mmHg, and 10-year ASCVD risk 9%, I would prioritize lifestyle therapy, initiate a moderate-intensity statin after a risk discussion, consider CAC if decisions remain uncertain, reinforce diet and activity with a plan and follow-up, and avoid aspirin; if diabetes were present, I would add metformin and a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor based on comorbidity profile, reassessing adherence and response every 3–6 months [^1171i962] [^111CzrrQ] [^111ff9Qb].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is coherent: primary prevention is a lifelong, risk-based, patient-centered endeavor that layers lifestyle interventions first, then evidence-based pharmacotherapy tailored to absolute risk, with shared decision-making, team-based care, and attention to adherence and equity; precision tools enhance but do not replace this foundation, and continuous reappraisal of risk and preferences keeps care dynamic and effective [^116jPjSd] [^1135p1LP] [^115bzEPo].

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention relies on **risk-based, guideline-directed therapy** and **shared decision-making** to reduce events and mortality [^116jPjSd]. The most effective strategies include:

- **Lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation are foundational and reduce risk across the spectrum [^116jPjSd] [^111wxZmC].
- **Statins**: First-line for primary and secondary prevention; use intensity matched to risk and LDL-C response [^113Loper] [^111CzrrQ].
- **Blood pressure**: Treat to < 130/80 mmHg in most adults, with lower targets in high-risk patients when tolerated [^notfound].
- **Diabetes**: Use metformin first-line; add GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for CVD risk reduction [^111ff9Qb] [^115ds7BJ].
- **Aspirin**: Reserve for select high-risk primary prevention after risk–benefit discussion; not routine [^112E294o] [^1176By5P].

Implementation is strengthened by **team-based care**, **clinical decision support**, and addressing social determinants to close gaps in adherence and outcomes [^11527fLg] [^1154Wfh7].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of CVD prevention, with **dietary patterns** such as DASH, Mediterranean, and plant-forward diets reducing CVD events and mortality [^notfound]. Regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise) improves cardiovascular outcomes and should be individualized to patient ability and comorbidities [^111wxZmC]. Weight management (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²) and smoking cessation further reduce CVD risk and are essential components of prevention strategies [^116jPjSd].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Lipid management

Statins are **first-line therapy** for primary and secondary prevention, with intensity tailored to ASCVD risk and LDL-C response [^113Loper]. High-intensity statins are recommended for patients with clinical ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with multiple risk factors, aiming for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^114KK716]. Nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) are added when LDL-C goals are not met or intolerance occurs [^113Loper].

---

### Blood pressure management

Hypertension treatment is recommended for most adults to a target of **< 130/80 mmHg**, with lower targets considered for high-risk patients when tolerated [^notfound]. Pharmacotherapy selection should be individualized based on comorbidities, age, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring and adjustment to achieve targets [^116gfPwC].

---

### Diabetes management

Metformin remains **first-line** for type 2 diabetes, with GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors added for patients with established CVD or high risk, given their cardiovascular benefits [^111ff9Qb] [^115ds7BJ]. Individualized glycemic targets and comprehensive risk factor management are essential [^111ff9Qb].

---

### Antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin is **not routinely recommended** for primary prevention due to bleeding risk; it may be considered selectively in high-risk patients after shared decision-making [^112E294o] [^1176By5P]. For secondary prevention, aspirin remains a cornerstone unless contraindicated [^1176By5P].

---

## Risk assessment and personalized medicine

Risk assessment using validated tools (e.g. Pooled Cohort Equations) guides prevention strategies, with **lifetime risk** considered in younger patients to inform early intervention [^1171i962] [^116eaPRQ]. Personalized medicine approaches, including genetic testing and pharmacogenomics, are emerging but require further validation before routine implementation [^116tnLME] [^114V3uwJ].

---

## Implementation strategies

Effective CVD prevention requires **multidisciplinary care**, clinical decision support, and patient education to improve adherence and outcomes [^11527fLg] [^113gmECH]. Addressing social determinants of health and leveraging digital health tools can enhance engagement and close care gaps [^116jPjSd] [^11527fLg].

---

## Controversies and future directions

Controversies persist regarding **blood pressure targets**, the role of aspirin in primary prevention, and the cost-effectiveness of emerging therapies [^115xdVCE] [^112E294o]. Ongoing research aims to refine risk stratification, improve adherence, and evaluate novel therapies, including precision medicine and digital interventions [^116tnLME] [^11527fLg].

---

Cardiovascular disease prevention requires a **comprehensive, risk-based approach** integrating lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies, supported by shared decision-making and team-based care. Continued research and implementation efforts are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce the global burden of CVD.

### Exercise: the ultimate treatment to all ailments? [^111wxZmC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Extensive clinical research has provided robust evidence that exercise is a cost‐effective measure to substantially alleviate the burden of a large number of diseases, many of which belong to the cardiovascular (CV) spectrum. In terms of cardiac benefit, the positive effects of exercise are attributed to improvements in standard risk factors for atherosclerosis, as well as to its positive impact on several pathophysiological mechanisms for CV diseases. For secondary prevention, exercise, optimally in the context of a cardiac rehabilitation program, has been shown to improve functional capacity and survival. Clinicians should encourage physical activity and provide exercise recommendations for all patients, taking into consideration any underlying pathology. In the present review, the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of major CV risk factors and heart conditions are analyzed.

### Disease-specific therapy for the treatment of the cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease: a systematic review [^115E75s7]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of disease-specific therapy compared with placebo, and to no intervention, for the cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease. The heterogeneity of the evidence made it difficult to assess the effectiveness of disease-specific therapy, and it remains unclear whether it sufficiently impacts the cardiovascular manifestations. Further work, ideally in larger cohorts, with more standardised clinical and phenotypic outcomes, the latter measured using contemporary imaging, circulating biomarker and heart rhythm techniques, are required to fully elucidate the impact of disease-specific therapy on the cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease.

### Efficacy and safety in clinical trials in cardiovascular disease [^115rBKC6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Mortality and morbid events are insensitive guides to the efficacy and safety of interventions in chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD). To enhance the ability to find new and effective long-term treatments, especially for the early stages of CVD, a revised strategy for clinical trials should emphasize efficacy on disease progression while monitoring symptoms and quality of life as guides to clinical benefit. Mortality, which is uncommon except in acute or advanced disease, provides at best a crude guide to net efficacy and safety. It must be monitored to support demonstrated efficacy on disease progression without adverse safety effects. This revised approach, made possible by our enhanced ability to monitor the progression of disease, should make it possible to study earlier disease and to improve cardiovascular health while reducing health care costs.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1127rhZC]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Meaningful prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) requires prolongation of life to age 90 or 100 free of morbid events. This requires early detection of the CVD phenotypes and effective treatment to slow their progression. We present a strategy for screening and evaluation of the population that should accomplish that goal with potential benefits on both cost and cardiovascular health. Studies to document the effectiveness of this strategy are urgently needed.

### Personalized cardiovascular disease prevention by applying individualized prediction of treatment effects [^112VUeKA]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Large-scale randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and anti-platelet therapy to prevent cardiovascular diseases. A challenge for clinicians is to apply group-level evidence from these trials to individual patients. Trials typically report a single treatment effect estimate which is the average effect of all participants, comprising patients who respond poorly, intermediately, and well. Clinicians would preferably make patient-tailored treatment decisions. Therefore, one would require an estimate of an individual patient's response to therapy. Although not yet widely recognized, trials contain this type of information. In this paper, we show how available information from landmark trials can be translated to an individual 'treatment score' through the use of multivariable therapeutic prediction models. These models provide an individual estimate of the absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular events given the specific combination of multiple clinical characteristics of a patient under care. Based on this individualized treatment estimate and metrics such as the individual number-needed-to-treat, clinicians together with their patients can decide whether drug treatment or what treatment intensity is worthwhile. Selective treatment of those who can anticipate the greatest benefit and the least harm on an individualized basis could reduce the number of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs beyond that currently achievable by subgroup analyses based on single patient characteristics.

### The continuum of personalized cardiovascular medicine: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology [^115bzEPo]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Personalized medicine implies a tailored approach to patients that offers more effective therapy for each individual, reduces risks and avoids unnecessary treatments or diagnostic interventions. Treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has markedly improved through the evaluation of new therapy concepts in large, controlled trials that provide evidence-based guidance. While this approach has, e.g. reduced morbidity and mortality in acute coronary artery disease and extended significantly life expectancy in chronic ischaemic heart disease and heart failure, there remains a high, and increasing, burden of CVD. Conditions such as atrial fibrillation, acute heart failure, or sudden cardiac death still cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality in the population. Furthermore, patients who survive acute cardiac events often require long-term treatment for chronic conditions. The development and implementation of a more personalized management offer potential to significantly improve outcome.

Controlled trials by nature apply the same approach and therapy to patients with the same disease entity, even if with different disease stages and manifestations. Yet clinical cardiological practice aims to take into account differences between individual patients into therapeutic decisions. Initial concepts of personalized medicine focused heavily on genetic markers, particularly in oncology, but equally in CVD where genomics was the first marker which was considered. This has yielded interesting insights for some areas, such as unwanted drug effects, but this one-sided approach has limitations and a more comprehensive strategy is needed. Application of risk stratification based on clinical, biochemical, imaging, and/or genomic markers is already used to tailor therapy, but remains fragmented and research often focuses on single aspects of personalization.

Based on a workshop held by the European Society of Cardiology, this report summarizes the current state of stratified cardiovascular care and examines the available and required tools to progress towards more personalized cardiovascular medicine. Actions are proposed that are necessary to expand and implement personalized medicine in CVDs and overcome potential hurdles.

### Systematic review of the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics-guided treatment for cardiovascular diseases [^114V3uwJ]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) examines how variations in an individual's DNA sequence affect drug metabolism and response, including occurrence of adverse drug events and impact on treatment effectiveness. It differs from traditional diagnostic genetic/genomic testing, which looks at the associations between changes in a person's DNA sequence and diseases. Thus, PGx may facilitate a personalized approach to disease management by identifying the safest and most effective treatment options for an individual. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is at the forefront of PGx-guided therapy. Being the leading cause of death worldwide, CVD contributes significantly to the increasing health economic burden. In 2016, CVD accounted for 31% of all deaths globally (17.9 million people). Approximately $555 billion in CVD-related direct and indirect health-care costs were incurred in the United States in 2016. These costs are projected to increase to $1.1 trillion by the year 2035. A number of drug classes exist to reduce CVD risk, but there is significant variation in treatment response. In addition to the variation that can be attributed to various sociodemographic characteristics, genetic determinants of drug response have been identified, which can affect the way drugs are metabolized, absorbed, and distributed.– Therefore, genetic information can be used to inform risk factor identification, drug dose responses, side effects management, and outcome prediction. –

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^112DEs4V]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### Cardiovascular precision medicine in the genomics era [^116tnLME]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Precision medicine strives to delineate disease using multiple data sources — from genomics to digital health metrics — in order to be more precise and accurate in our diagnoses, definitions, and treatments of disease subtypes. By defining disease at a deeper level, we can treat patients based on an understanding of the molecular underpinnings of their presentations, rather than grouping patients into broad categories with one-size-fits-all treatments. In this review, the authors examine how precision medicine, specifically that surrounding genetic testing and genetic therapeutics, has begun to make strides in both common and rare cardiovascular diseases in the clinic and the laboratory, and how these advances are beginning to enable us to more effectively define risk, diagnose disease, and deliver therapeutics for each individual patient.

To facilitate the guideline-based implementation of treatment recommendations in the ambulatory setting and to encourage participation in the multiple preventive health efforts that exist, we have organized several recent guideline updates into a simple ABCDEF approach. We would remind clinicians that evidence-based medicine is meant to inform recommendations but that synthesis of patient-specific data and use of appropriate clinical judgment in each individual situation is ultimately preferred.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention risk assessment — Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions.

### Clinical decision support in cardiovascular medicine [^11527fLg]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Despite considerable progress in tackling cardiovascular disease over the past 50 years, many gaps in the quality of care for cardiovascular disease remain. Multiple missed opportunities have been identified at every step in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, such as failure to make risk factor modifications, failure to diagnose cardiovascular disease, and failure to use proper evidence based treatments. With the digital transformation of medicine and advances in health information technology, clinical decision support (CDS) tools offer promise to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of cardiovascular care. However, to date, the promise of CDS delivering scalable and sustained value for patient care in clinical practice has not been realized. This article reviews the evidence on key emerging questions around the development, implementation, and regulation of CDS with a focus on cardiovascular disease. It first reviews evidence on the effectiveness of CDS on healthcare process and clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular disease and design features associated with CDS effectiveness. It then reviews the barriers encountered during implementation of CDS in cardiovascular care, with a focus on unintended consequences and strategies to promote successful implementation. Finally, it reviews the legal and regulatory environment of CDS with specific examples for cardiovascular disease.

### Where to now in cardiovascular disease prevention [^116wwF77]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have been instrumental in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease, especially in the developed world. Recently however this improvement has plateaued, highlighting the importance of optimising current strategies and considering alternative practises. Inequalities in global healthcare, the changing patient profile as a result of an obesity and diabetes epidemic, and inadequate utilisation of evidence-based treatments are partly responsible. Despite pharmacotherapies such as statins having substantial evidence for cardiovascular benefit, patient response may be variable with genetic factors thought to be partly responsible. Although randomised controlled trials remain the backbone of clinical research, they have limitations including time taken to complete a trial and the financial costs associated with it. In this opinion-based paper, we discuss some of the key considerations for the future of cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Effectiveness-based guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women – 2011 update: a guideline from the American Heart Association [^1154Q5hn]. Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention in women — patient and public education — adherence to lifestyle and medical therapies is low, with only 7% of people with CHD in 2000 adhering to prescribed treatments for CVD lifestyle risk factors, and studies of medical therapy show similarly low persistence. People with chronic illnesses may see up to 16 different physicians annually, complicating adherence reinforcement, and Thirty percent to 70% of all hospital admissions for medication-related illness are attributed to poor adherence, resulting in substantial additional healthcare costs.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^1165rLhC]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^1164UeJ7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA classification of recommendation and level of evidence — treatment-effect classes and wording are defined as follows: Class I (Benefit > > > Risk) "SHOULD be performed/ administered"; Class IIa (Benefit > > Risk) "IT IS REASONABLE to perform procedure/administer treatment"; Class IIb (Benefit ≥ Risk) "Procedure/Treatment MAY BE CONSIDERED"; and Class III categories include "No Benefit" and "Harm" with suggested phrases for No Benefit ("is not recommended", "is not indicated", "should not be performed/ administered/ other", "is not useful/ effective/ beneficial") and for Harm ("is not recommended", "potentially harmful", "causes harm", "associated with excess morbidity/ mortality", "should not be performed/ administered/ other"). Level of Evidence A is described as "Multiple populations evaluated" with "Data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses"; Level B as "Limited populations evaluated" with "Data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies"; and Level C as "Very limited populations evaluated" with "Only consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard of care". For comparative effectiveness in Class I, preferred wording includes "treatment/strategy A is recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "treatment A should be chosen over treatment B". The document also clarifies that "A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak" and emphasizes clinician judgment: "These guidelines are meant to define practices that meet the needs of patients in most circumstances and are not a replacement for clinical judgment" and "The ultimate decision about care for a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of the circumstances presented by that patient".

### Cardiovascular precision medicine in the genomics era [^113S2Cmu]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

In launching the Precision Medicine Initiative in early 2015, President Obama defined the effort as "delivering the right treatments, at the right time, every time to the right person". This new era of precision medicine strives to redefine diseases using multiple sources of data, including lifestyle, medical history, imaging, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, sensor data, and more. In being both more precise and more accurate in our diagnosis and in our definitions of subtypes of disease, we can treat patients based on the true underpinnings of their specific presentations, rather than grouping patients into broad categories with one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal of this strategy is not only to give patients more efficient and effective care, but also to reduce patient harm and limit health care costs arising from unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.

In this review, we discuss existing successes of precision medicine in multiple clinical areas and their implications in cardiovascular medicine. We then examine how precision medicine, most specifically that surrounding genetic testing and genetic therapeutics, has begun to make strides in both common and rare cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In addition, we examine how basic research, including the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), is advancing precision cardiovascular medicine.

Patient-centered approaches to comprehensive ASCVD prevention — Shared decision-making should guide discussions about the best strategies to reduce ASCVD risk (COR I; LOE B-R). Decisions about primary prevention should be collaborative between a clinician and a patient, and collaborative decisions are more likely to address potential barriers to treatment options compared with treatment and guidance offered without patient input.

### Cardiovascular disease progression: a target for therapy? [^115simBD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical research aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease has focused on the effect of interventions to reduce risk factors on the incidence of future morbid events. Disease progression, which likely serves as a necessary prerequisite for morbid events, has not served as a target for therapy. The Rasmussen Center at the University of Minnesota has, for the past 18 years, been performing a noninvasive cardiovascular evaluation in individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease. The studies, performed in 1 hour in one room, provide a comprehensive noninvasive assessment of the severity of functional and structural abnormalities in the small arteries, the large arteries and the left ventricle, the target organs for most cardiovascular morbid events. Preliminary follow-up data have revealed a striking relationship between the Disease Score, which represents the sum of the abnormal tests, and the risk of future morbid events. In order to develop strategies to prolong cardiovascular disease-free life expectancy, studies in early stages of disease aimed at slowing disease progression should be encouraged.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^117JEJqa]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### Smoking cessation interventions in cardiovascular patients [^113fKApG]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review current evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in cardiovascular patient populations.

Design and Materials

Studies were obtained from systematic reviews of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group. Twelve Cochrane reviews related to secondary prevention in a variety of populations were used to extract eligible studies. Studies were eligible when they considered smokers diagnosed with symptomatic cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Data concerning the comparison between the intervention of interest and a placebo or standard treatment group were derived from eligible papers. Based on these data, Absolute Risk Reduction figures were calculated to express the effectiveness of each intervention on smoking cessation.

Results

We found 12 studies examining smoking cessation interventions in cardiovascular patients. Five studies reported significant results. No evidence was found for Nicotine Replacement Therapy or other pharmacology to be effective, neither for self-help materials, group, individual or telephone counseling. There is limited evidence for physician's advice and nurse-delivered interventions to be effective.

Conclusions

Smoking cessation studies in cardiovascular patients are scarce. The available studies show very limited effects. The reasons for the lack of success of smoking cessation strategies in these patients remain unclear. Further research is needed to find effective cessation strategies for patients with cardiovascular diseases.

### Does early intensive multifactorial therapy reduce modelled cardiovascular risk in individuals with screen-detected diabetes? Results from the ADDITION-Europe cluster randomized trial [^111dqVSY]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is associated with significantly elevated all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, as well as a higher incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease. Among individuals with established diabetes, risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality can be reduced by intensive treatment of multiple risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose, although there remains some uncertainty about the merits of tight glycaemic control. Treatment of individual cardiovascular disease risk factors is also effective but we know less about intensive treatment earlier in the disease trajectory. Long-term results from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) suggest a beneficial effect of intensive treatment of glucose in those with shorter diabetes duration. Promotion of opportunistic screening and testing for diabetes in at-risk asymptomatic patients will lead to a greater number of individuals being diagnosed early. However, there are a number of outstanding uncertainties that need to be resolved before intensive multifactorial treatment can be recommended in this patient group.

ADDITION-Europe is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial exploring the effect of an intervention to promote intensive multifactorial treatment in a population with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes. Five-year results from the ADDITION-Europe trial show small but significant increases in treatment and reductions in many cardiovascular disease risk factors, but a non-significant 17% reduction in cardiovascular events. Longer-term follow-up may be needed in order to establish whether early intensive treatment reduces cardiovascular risk.

In the absence of long-term data on hard outcomes, the difference in 10-year modelled cardiovascular disease risk at 5 years in ADDITION-Europe can shed light on the early cardiovascular disease experience of screen-detected individuals. We aimed to (1) describe the change in 10-year modelled cardiovascular risk in the 5 years following diagnosis with this screen-detected population and (2) quantify the impact of the intervention on 10-year modelled cardiovascular risk at 5 years.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1116ZZwp]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Cost and value considerations in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: The guideline defines value as "the incremental health benefits of a therapy or procedure relative to its incremental net long-term costs", and notes "the growing need to consider value" given "finite healthcare resources in the primary prevention of CVD". Integration of value assessments faces "inherent methodological challenges", including variability in costs across settings and subgroups, variability over time, differences in who bears health outcomes versus costs, and "an inadequate literature base" for some therapies. The 2011 policy statement highlights that "assessing the value of prevention in apparently healthy patients is generally more difficult" because the time horizon is long, and "it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to assess long-term effectiveness in terms of survival or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or associated costs" as uncertainty increases. Despite these challenges, "robust evidence suggests that both antihypertensive therapy and statin therapy, particularly with low-cost generic drug formulations, are high-value interventions across a wide spectrum of risk and age strata".

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1176By5P]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials totaling > 47000 patients called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for 3 key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events. In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include the optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection, and interplay between sex and treatment response. In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Rather, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach. In this article, we revisit the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by critically reviewing the key scientific literature, highlight key areas of uncertainties for future research, and propose a decisional framework for clinicians to support prescription of aspirin in primary prevention.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^114afJ9F]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our study fills the aforementioned gaps in evidence and provides compelling evidence from randomised trials for the beneficial effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment across the spectrum of systolic blood pressure in people with or without a known diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Our findings do not substantiate concerns about a J-shaped association between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies, and dismiss the suggestions that blood pressure-lowering treatment is only effective when blood pressure is above a certain threshold.

These findings have important implications for clinical practice. Currently, the approach to prescribing antihypertensives depends on an individual's previous history of cardiovascular disease and blood pressure value. Although guidelines vary on the degree of their emphasis on these two risk factors, they invariably modify recommendations based on them. For instance, New Zealand has largely abandoned the approach of treating hypertension and recommends screening adults for overall cardiovascular risk as the first stage towards clinical decision making. Nonetheless, in the second stage, those ranked to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease are additionally required to have a high blood pressure to qualify for antihypertensive treatment. Most other guidelines have an even stronger reliance on blood pressure, often with explicit criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in the first stage and then consideration of treatment at the second stage in a subset of hypertensive participants. For instance, in England, blood pressure-lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is not considered as relevant when baseline systolic blood pressure is less than 140 mm Hg. Most guidelines also define a floor level for reducing blood pressure, assuming that lowering blood pressure below a common threshold would be ineffective or to have an uncertain or even detrimental effect.

Our study calls for a revision of these guidelines. The finding that a fixed and modest degree of blood pressure reduction is expected to lead to similar relative reductions in risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of current blood pressure or presence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, calls for consideration of blood pressure-lowering treatment for any individual who has a sufficiently high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. By considering antihypertensives as a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk, rather than simply reducing blood pressure, clinicians are no longer required to make decisions according to an arbitrary and confusing classification of hypertension. The need for and the burden of exact measurement of blood pressure is also reduced. This will not only simplify decision-making, management, and communication of treatment strategies with participants but, as shown in previous modelling studies, will also lead to more efficient care compared with alternative strategies that rely more heavily on absolute blood pressure values.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic Coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1151anLh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Chronic Coronary Disease" provides an update to and consolidates new evidence since the "2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease" and the corresponding "2014 ACC/AHA/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS Focused Update of the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease".

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from September 2021 to May 2022. Clinical studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and other evidence conducted on human participants were identified that were published in English from MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline.

Structure

This guideline provides an evidenced-based and patient-centered approach to management of patients with chronic coronary disease, considering social determinants of health and incorporating the principles of shared decision-making and team-based care. Relevant topics include general approaches to treatment decisions, guideline-directed management and therapy to reduce symptoms and future cardiovascular events, decision-making pertaining to revascularization in patients with chronic coronary disease, recommendations for management in special populations, patient follow-up and monitoring, evidence gaps, and areas in need of future research. Where applicable, and based on availability of cost-effectiveness data, cost-value recommendations are also provided for clinicians. Many recommendations from previously published guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.

### Evolution of the American college of cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: a 10-year assessment [^111H4Vkb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical practice guidelines provide a vetted framework for high‐quality, up‐to‐date standards of care to guide clinicians in important management decisions. National professional organizations make these recommendations through committee consensus after systematic review of scientific evidence, 1 while using caution to minimize conflict of interest and ensure that the guidelines are relevant to clinical practice. 2 To keep pace with evolving practice standards and evidence, new guidelines are created while older guidelines are periodically revised.

Since 1984, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have concurrently produced recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with, or who are at risk for, cardiovascular disease. 3 The strength and relative benefit‐to‐risk ratio of each recommendation is expressed as the class of recommendation (COR), while the quality of the underlying evidence is expressed by the level of evidence (LOE) designation (Table 1). 4, 5, 6 Full‐guideline revisions occur approximately every 4 or more years, but individual recommendations may be reviewed annually. 7 Individual recommendation revisions are termed "focused updates", as they represent the most current amendments, deletions, or additions to guidelines based on significant new research.

### Screening for cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic patients [^1111B6va]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death in the western world and 1 of the leading causes of death worldwide. The lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) for persons at age 50 years, on average, is estimated to be 52% for men and 39% for women, with a wide variation depending on risk factor burden. Assessing patients' cardiovascular risk may be used for the targeting of preventive treatments of individual patients who are asymptomatic but at sufficiently high risk for the development of CVD. Risk stratifying patients for CVD remains challenging, particularly for those with low or intermediate short-term risk. Several algorithms have been described to facilitate the assessment of risk in individual patients. We describe 6 risk algorithms (Framingham Risk Score for coronary heart disease events and for cardiovascular events, Adult Treatment Panel III, SCORE [Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation] project, Reynolds Risk Score, ASSIGN [Assessing Cardiovascular Risk to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network/SIGN to Assign Preventative Treatment], and QRISK [QRESEARCH Cardiovascular Risk Algorithm]) for outcomes, population derived/validated, receiver-operating characteristic, variables included, and limitations. Areas of uncertainty include 10-year versus lifetime risk, prediction of CVD or coronary heart disease end points, nonlaboratory-based risk scores, age at which to start, race and sex differences, and whether a risk score should guide therapy. We believe that the best high-risk approach to CVD evaluation and prevention lies in routine testing for cardiovascular risk factors and risk score assessment. We recommend that health care providers discuss the global cardiovascular risk and lifetime cardiovascular risk score assessment with each patient to better explain each patient's future risk. Appropriate intervention, guided by risk assessment, has the potential to bring about a significant reduction in population levels of risk.

### Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: controversies and clinical considerations [^111tGkFj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

A new guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol was recently released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), serving as an update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III cholesterol guideline first released in 2001. With significant changes to key definitions, treatment strategy, and therapy selection, the guideline has transformed the treatment of blood cholesterol and also created controversy within the health care community. This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.

### Depression and cardiovascular disease [^115TTkAg]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is a wealth of evidence linking depression to increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and worse outcomes among patients with known CVD. In addition, there are safe and effective treatments for depression. Despite this, depression remains under-recognized and undertreated in patients at risk for or living with CVD. In this review, we first summarize the evidence linking depression to increased risk of CVD and worse patient outcomes. We then review the mechanisms by which depression may contribute to cardiovascular risk and poor cardiovascular outcomes. We then summarize prior studies of depression treatment on cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we offer guidance in the identification and management of depression among CVD populations. Given that 1 in 4 CVD patients has concurrent depression, application of these best-practices will assist providers in achieving optimal outcomes for their CVD patients.

### Would you recommend aspirin to this patient for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^112evdqi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (> 10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score? At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not? and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^115NumMC]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cancer and cardiovascular (CV) disease are the most prevalent diseases in the developed world. Evidence increasingly shows that these conditions are interlinked through common risk factors, coincident in an ageing population, and are connected biologically through some deleterious effects of anticancer treatment on CV health. Anticancer therapies can cause a wide spectrum of short- and long-term cardiotoxic effects. An explosion of novel cancer therapies has revolutionised this field and dramatically altered cancer prognosis. Nevertheless, these new therapies have introduced unexpected CV complications beyond heart failure. Common CV toxicities related to cancer therapy are defined, along with suggested strategies for prevention, detection and treatment. This ESMO consensus article proposes to define CV toxicities related to cancer or its therapies and provide guidance regarding prevention, screening, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity. The majority of anticancer therapies are associated with some CV toxicity, ranging from asymptomatic and transient to more clinically significant and long-lasting cardiac events. It is critical however, that concerns about potential CV damage resulting from anticancer therapies should be weighed against the potential benefits of cancer therapy, including benefits in overall survival. CV disease in patients with cancer is complex and treatment needs to be individualised. The scope of cardio-oncology is wide and includes prevention, detection, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity related to cancer therapy, and also ensuring the safe development of future novel cancer treatments that minimise the impact on CV health. It is anticipated that the management strategies discussed herein will be suitable for the majority of patients. Nonetheless, the clinical judgment of physicians remains extremely important; hence, when using these best clinical practices to inform treatment options and decisions, practitioners should also consider the individual circumstances of their patients on a case-by-case basis.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### Reducing global risk for cardiovascular disease: using lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy [^115fL1fG]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in industrialized societies, due in large part to the lack of a comprehensive approach to control the risk factors for atherosclerosis. One strategy for reducing an individual's global CVD risk relies on a targeted approach that modifies each of the major independent risk factors prevalent in both symptomatic (secondary prevention) and asymptomatic (primary prevention) patients. These interventions include lipid lowering, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, glycemic control, regular exercise, and the use of various medications. This review offers an evidence-based strategy toward reducing an individual's global risk for CVD by addressing the modifiable, major independent risk factors.

### Changes in diet, cardiovascular risk factors and modelled cardiovascular risk following diagnosis of diabetes: 1-year results from the ADDITION-cambridge trial cohort [^111v8GKU]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health problem, associated with a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those without the disease. Lifestyle behaviours, including diet, are strongly associated with risk of incident diabetes and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dietary modification for weight management and for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipid levels, is an important first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed patients. Such individuals will also be given physical activity advice and may be considered for pharmacotherapy. Evidence-informed nutritional guidelines for the management of diabetes from Diabetes UKand the American Diabetes Associationfocus on the reduction of total energy intake, percentage of energy from saturated fat, and sodium intake, alongside increases in fibre, and fruit and vegetable intake. Randomized trials of lifestyle interventions including dietary modification have demonstrated reduced incidence of diabetes in high-risk individualsand improved cardiovascular disease risk factors in those with established diabetes. Although less well established, research also suggests that dietary changes in individuals with newly or recently diagnosed diabetes may be valuable. However, the lack of measurement of diet makes it difficult to quantify the contribution that dietary change made to the beneficial effects observed in these trials.

What's new?

Dietary modification is an important first-line treatment option for clinically diagnosed patients.
Dietary changes in individuals with screen-detected diabetes may also be valuable. However, the lack of measurement of diet in previous trials makes it difficult to quantify the contribution that dietary change can make to cardiovascular risk reduction in this patient group.
Improvements in self-reported dietary behaviour and plasma vitamin C over 1 year in our screen-detected population were associated with small reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors and modelled cardiovascular disease risk, independently of cardio-protective medication and physical activity.
Dietary change may have a role to play in the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk following diagnosis of diabetes.

Population screening for diabetes has been recommended by several national organizations and the National Health Service (NHS) includes assessment of diabetes in its Health Checks programme. Consequently, more individuals will be found earlier in the disease trajectory, where there is little current evidence for treatment recommendations. Furthering our understanding of dietary change and potential cardiovascular disease risk reduction in individuals with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes should inform provision of diabetes care and improve targeting of resources.

Approach to risk assessment — The Work Group recognized the need for an approach based on data that primary care providers could easily collect and implement and endorsed the paradigm of matching the intensity of preventive efforts with the individual's absolute risk; it acknowledges that none of the examined risk assessment tools or novel markers have been formally evaluated in randomized controlled trials with clinical events, states that treatment can be targeted to those most likely to benefit in the context of a "risk discussion" that could include the patient's ASCVD risk, potential benefits, adverse effects, risks, and patient preferences, and notes the limitation that risk estimation is based on group averages applied to individuals such that no one has 10% or 20% or 4% of a heart attack during a 10-year period.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^111ff9Qb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes guideline mentioned glycaemia management in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, it did not cover the treatment approaches for patients with T2DM having a high risk of CVD, and treatment and screening approaches for CVDs in patients with concomitant T2DM. This consensus guideline undertakes the data obtained from all the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) to propose approaches for the T2DM management in presence of CV comorbidities. For patients at high risk of CVD, metformin is the drug of choice to manage the T2DM to achieve a patient specific HbA1c target. In case of established CVD, a combination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefits is recommended along with metformin, while for chronic kidney disease or heart failure, a sodium–glucose transporter proteins-2 inhibitor with proven benefit is advised. This document also summarises various screening and investigational approaches for the major CV events with their accuracy and specificity along with the treatment guidance to assist the healthcare professionals in selecting the best management strategies for every individual. Since lifestyle modification and management plays an important role in maintaining the effectiveness of the pharmacological therapies, authors of this consensus recommendation have also briefed on the patient-centric non-pharmacological management of T2DM and CVD.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Cardiovascular complications in diabetes: targets and interventions [^115auhbt]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications are mainly responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. The awareness of physicians for the importance of primary prevention increased lately and numerous strategies have been developed. The spectrum ranges from pharmacologic treatment to vitamins and dietetic interventions. Some interesting concepts such as focusing on exogenous advanced glycation end products have emerged, but definitive results on their clinical relevance are still lacking. A major problem of the primary prevention is the choice of the method applied for screening, the criteria used to classify risk patients, as well as the choice of therapy. Guidelines provide goals to be achieved and offer alternatives for treatment, but the medical decision has to be made on an individualized basis. In this overview, we will comprehensively focus on the most important pathomechanisms and clinically relevant approaches, aiming at the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes along with coronary heart disease. When primary prevention fails, we advocate a more aggressive treatment of critically ill patients, followed by optimal secondary prevention meeting on-target goals precisely.

ACC/AHA primary prevention scope — adults and targeted outcomes: The guideline addresses the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults (≥ 18 years of age) and focuses on outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease of atherosclerotic origin, and also includes heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is intended to be a resource for the clinical and public health practice communities and presents recommendations related to lifestyle factors, other factors affecting CVD risk (eg, obesity, diabetes, blood cholesterol, high BP, smoking, aspirin use), patient-centered approaches, and considerations of the cost and value of primary prevention.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^115ds7BJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment of T2DM has now been expanded from a glucose-centric concept to an event-driven strategy due to the comorbidities. Many AHAs demonstrated effective CV and renal protection. The CVOTs, along with the management of glycaemia, have demonstrated to mitigate the microvascular and macrovascular risk. The SGLT2i and GLP1-RA show great promise in transforming the treatment of diabetes and concomitant CVDs by independently improving CV outcomes, over and above what can be achieved with standard of care management. Moreover, on the basis of researches conducted on the population with concomitant T2DM and CVDs, healthcare professionals have come up with a more reliable and novel screening techniques and therapeutic approaches for the CVDs as discussed in the earlier section. While these drugs seem promising in comorbidities management, their utility and safety in the general population remains an important parameter to be closely followed.

### Risk assessment for cardiovascular disease with nontraditional risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111DAuLG]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit — High certainty is when available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations assessing health outcomes, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by future studies. Moderate certainty is when evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes but confidence is constrained by factors such as the number, size, or quality of individual studies, inconsistency of findings, limited generalizability to routine primary care, or lack of coherence in the chain of evidence, and as more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change enough to alter the conclusion. Low certainty is when available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes due to limitations such as limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings, gaps in the chain of evidence, findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice, or lack of information on important health outcomes; more information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. The USPSTF defines certainty as the likelihood that its assessment of net benefit is correct and defines net benefit as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels.

### Therapy insight: management of cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer and cardiac complications of cancer therapy [^115UWWsi]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Cardiac disease in patients with cancer or caused by cancer therapy is a clinical problem of emerging importance. Optimum management of cardiovascular disease can mean that patients with cancer can successfully receive therapies to treat their malignancy and can reduce morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors. The presence of cancer and cancer-related morbidities substantially complicates the management of cardiovascular disease in cancer patients. In this Review, we discuss management strategies for cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer, focusing on the prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction.

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^112Keb3S]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Smoking cessation a critical component of medical management in chronic disease populations [^116882MV]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Many innovative and effective smoking-cessation treatments, both behavioral and pharmacologic, have been developed over the past several decades. However, these treatments traditionally have been developed for use with populations of healthy smokers. Despite the disease management implications, efforts to design and evaluate cessation interventions targeting smokers diagnosed with chronic diseases are reported infrequently in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the evidence linking continued smoking to disease progression and adverse treatment outcomes across a range of common chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, asthma, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Where studies are available, the efficacy of smoking-cessation interventions specifically developed or applied to these patient populations is reviewed. Finally, limitations and gaps in smoking research and treatment with chronically ill patients are discussed, and future research priorities are recommended.

### Derivation, validation, and evaluation of a new QRISK model to estimate lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease: cohort study using QResearch database [^116eaPRQ]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Our study leaves many unanswered questions, including whether early intervention in people with a high lifetime risk but low 10 year risk would have a greater clinical benefit than later intervention; whether people at low absolute risk would value long term treatments with little short term gain; determining the appropriate threshold for lifetime risk to balance the expected benefits (such as event-free years) against the potential adverse effects of interventions such as statins; and determining the most appropriate and effective methods for communicating absolute and relative risk to patients.

Conclusion

We have developed and validated a new model for estimating lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. This approach identifies different people being at high risk compared with estimating 10 year risk. Compared with the 10 year QRISK2 score, the lifetime approach identified patients for intervention at a younger age, with a higher proportion of men, more people from ethnic minority groups, and more with a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Although lifestyle interventions at an earlier age could be advantageous, medical interventions carry risks as soon as they are initiated, so the net potential benefit remains uncertain. Additional research is needed to closely examine the cost effectiveness and acceptability of such an approach.

### LDL cholesterol: how low to go? [^116kRVgD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal, and continuous not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis, therefore, to set a target or 'floor' for LDL cholesterol lowering, and this presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers. With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly but health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. Based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy, it is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk (aggressive and established CVD) who will obtain the highest benefit, that is, those with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111CzrrQ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Fasting or nonfasting lipid measurements: It depends on the question [^115Vm5w2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association Guideline (AHA) on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment thresholds have been replaced with a focus on global risk. In this context, we re-examine the need for fasting lipid measurements in various clinical scenarios including estimating initial risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in a primary prevention patient; screening for familial lipid disorders in a patient with a strong family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or genetic dyslipidemia; clarifying a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome so it can be used to make lifestyle counseling more effective; assessing residual risk in a treated patient; diagnosing and treating patients with suspected hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis; or diagnosing hypertriglyceridemia in patients who require therapy for other conditions that may further elevate triglycerides. Posing a specific question can aid the clinician in understanding when fasting lipids are needed and when nonfasting lipids are adequate.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Addressing residual risk beyond statin therapy: new targets in the management of dyslipidaemias – A report from the European Society of Cardiology cardiovascular round table [^113CiheF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of death in Europe. Despite proven benefits, use of lipid-lowering therapy remains suboptimal. Treatment goals are often not achieved, even in patients at high risk with atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). The occurrence of CV events in patients on lipid-lowering drugs is defined as "residual risk", and can result from inadequate control of plasma lipids or blood pressure, inflammation, diabetes, and environmental hazards. Assessment of CV risk factors and vascular imaging can aid in the evaluation and management decisions for individual patients. Lifestyle measures remain the primary intervention for lowering CV risk. Where drug therapies are required to reach lipid treatment targets, their effectiveness increases when they are combined with lifestyle measures delivered through formal programs. However, lipid drug dosage and poor adherence to treatment remain major obstacles to event-free survival. This article discusses guideline-supported treatment algorithms beyond statin therapy that can help reduce residual risk in specific patient profiles while also likely resulting in substantial healthcare savings through better patient management and treatment adherence.

### Lipid-lowering treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with high cardiovascular disease risk [^116DGC6m]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity among patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a twofold to fourfold higher risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) than patients without diabetes. In addition, type 2 diabetes patients with a history of CVD have an increased risk of recurrent events. Hence, high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes should be treated effectively to better manage cardiovascular risks.

Several studies have shown that lipid-lowering treatments (LLTs) such as statins are effective in reducing the risk of CVEs and total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a recent meta-analysis conducted by de Vries et al, patients with diabetes with CVD experienced reductions in relative risk with standard-dose and intensive-dose statins by an estimated 15% and 24%, respectively, for major CVEs or cerebrovascular events. According to the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, patients with type 2 diabetes are one of four statin benefit groups. Along with lifestyle recommendations, the 2015 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care position statement for CVD and risk management recommended different statin intensity treatment for patients of different age groups and CVD risk factors.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112MigqD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

In majority of patients with concomitant T2DM and CVD, the presence of certain comorbidities (e.g. atherosclerotic CVD, HF, chronic kidney disease, obesity) mandate a specific approach to the choice of glucose-lowering agents. This document, therefore, proposes an approach for the management of glycaemia in patients with T2DM and the above-mentioned comorbidities. It also elaborates on screening as well as management of major CV events in patients with concomitant T2DM, and prevention of these complications by lifestyle modifications in form of patient-centred care. This consensus recommendation helps health professionals to make decisions in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning every patient must be made by the responsible health professionals through a detailed consultation with the patient and the caregiver.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1171i962]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline: For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy).

### Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular complications [^117QtARa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. It has spread to more than 100 countries, and more than 1 million cases have been confirmed. Although coronavirus causes severe respiratory infections in humans, accumulating data have demonstrated cardiac complications and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. A large percent of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease, and they are at a high risk of developing cardiac complications. The basics of the virus, the clinical manifestations, and the possible mechanisms of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 are reviewed. Before an effective vaccine or medicine is available, supportive therapy and identifying patients who are at high risk of cardiac complications are important.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^112u89U7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular disease processes are highly prevalent and have major negative impacts on clinical outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. Nevertheless, optimal cardiovascular management in this population remains challenging due to the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, from which this high‐risk group continues to be excluded. Encouraging data on improvement of cardiovascular outcomes after successful renal transplantation with appropriate cardiovascular workup and management highlights the urgent need for clinical trials to investigate a wide array of unresolved clinical issues related to cardiovascular pathologies in advanced CKD.

### 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) / international society of hypertension (ISH) statement on management of hypertension [^114XfzxB]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypertension is estimated to cause 4.5% of current global disease burden and is as prevalent in many developing countries, as in the developed world. Blood pressure-induced cardiovascular risk rises continuously across the whole blood pressure range. Countries vary widely in capacity for management of hypertension, but worldwide the majority of diagnosed hypertensives are inadequately controlled. This statement addresses the ascertainment of overall cardiovascular risk to establish thresholds for initiation and goals of treatment, appropriate treatment strategies for non-drug and drug therapies, and cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Conclusions

Since publication of the WHO/ISH Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 1999, more evidence has become available to support a systolic blood pressure threshold of 140 mmHg for even 'low-risk' patients. In high-risk patients there is evidence for lower thresholds. Lifestyle modification is recommended for all individuals. There is evidence that specific agents have benefits for patients with particular compelling indications, and that monotherapy is inadequate for the majority of patients. For patients without a compelling indication for a particular drug class, on the basis of comparative trial data, availability, and cost, a low dose of diuretic should be considered for initiation of therapy. In most places a thiazide diuretic is the cheapest option and thus most cost effective, but for compelling indications where other classes provide additional benefits, even if more expensive, they may be more cost effective. In high-risk patients who attain large benefits from treatment, expensive drugs may be cost effective, but in low-risk patients treatment may not be cost-effective unless the drugs are cheap.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116uqt2p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113gmECH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines — Patient education is identified as a foundational principle and defined operationally, with guidance on delivery and evidence for benefit. ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines are intended for cardiovascular clinicians, yet patient education can be provided in person and by directing patients to digital resources such as those from the ACC and AHA; patient education is the delivery of information from clinicians to patients to improve health behavior and outcomes, and education about self-care skills to prevent and manage risk factors and conditions is essential. The clinical encounter provides a teachable moment, clinicians are ideally positioned to engage individuals who are at risk for or have cardiovascular conditions, and systematic reviews of educational interventions for secondary prevention in coronary heart disease have demonstrated effectiveness in improving disease-related knowledge, healthy behaviors, and medication adherence. Programs commonly used multiple delivery modes and multiple sessions with a reported median duration, 2 months, and program duration influenced outcomes, with those lasting > 3 months having more benefit; however, published studies are markedly heterogeneous in intensity, duration, delivery mode, resources needed, and outcome assessments.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment – from individual risk prediction to estimation of global risk and change in risk in the population [^112Vzc6E]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death and risk prediction formulae such as the Framingham Risk Score have been developed to easily identify patients at high risk that may require therapeutic interventions.

Discussion

Using cardiovascular risk formulae at a population level to estimate and compare average cardiovascular risk among groups has been recently proposed as a way to facilitate surveillance of net cardiovascular risk and target public health interventions. Risk prediction formulas may help to compare interventions that cause effects of different magnitudes and directions in several cardiovascular risk factors, because these formulas assess the net change in risk using easily obtainable clinical variables. Because of conflicting data estimates of the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, risk prediction formulae may be a useful tool to estimate such risk at a population level.

Summary

Although risk prediction formulae were intended on guiding clinicians to individualized therapy, they also can be used to ascertain trends at a population-level, particularly in situations where changes in different cardiovascular risk factors over time have different magnitudes and directions. The efficacy of interventions that are proposed to reduce cardiovascular risk impacting more than one risk factor can be well assessed by these means.

### Recommendations for the management of high-risk cardiac delivery: ACC cardiovascular disease in women committee panel [^114UvwyV]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

CVD is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of pregnant patients with CVD begins at preconception, continues through the duration of pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period. Despite the vulnerabilities associated with labor and delivery for patients with CVD, there is presently no standardized approach to labor and delivery. Moreover, the systematic exclusion of pregnant patients from randomized trials further limits the pool of evidence available to guide the pregnancy care of these high-risk patients and existing recommendations are based on expert consensus and cohort studies. In this review, we offer a summary of the current practices for the management of labor and delivery for pregnant patients. Notably, our recommendations are most pertinent to tertiary care centers in high-income countries, and generalizability to lower resourced centers and/or countries may be limited. Much work remains to define the standard of care, develop guidelines, and increase consistency in care delivery for this high-risk population and to ultimately improve maternal outcomes.

### Medical training to achieve competency in lifestyle counseling: an essential foundation for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic medical conditions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116M8hNM]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — Learning objectives for nutritional assessment and counseling during undergraduate medical training include to describe health benefits of recommended dietary patterns and current dietary guidelines for maintenance of health and for the prevention and treatment of diverse medical conditions; assess dietary behaviors and evaluate patients' habitual food intake; recognize the need for detailed nutritional assessment and referral to RDs and other healthcare professionals with nutritional expertise when appropriate; describe pathogenesis of nutrition-related diagnoses; diagnose nutrition-related problems and prioritize them; recognize and use diagnostic labels for documentation in patients' medical records; communicate effectively with RDs, including understanding the information conveyed by the "problem, etiology, signs, and symptoms" statements commonly used by RDs; assess patients' confidence and readiness to change toward a healthy lifestyle behavior that includes good nutritional practices; counsel patients on the benefits of evidenced-based recommended nutrition practices for the prevention and treatment of diverse medical conditions; use appropriate behavioral skills and tools to help patients initiate and maintain good nutritional practices; facilitate goal setting and periodic evaluation of dietary recommendations; and evaluate the health effects of nutrition modifications made by patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of personalized lifestyle management strategies for cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^111rFRpe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study reports the comparative effectiveness of several forms of lifestyle modifications, from the commonly advised smoking cessation, diet, and exercise strategies to a more contemporary form of exercise, yoga, on 10‐year CVD risk. For a current smoker, successfully quitting smoking is the most effective lifestyle change. Smoking cessation is, however, difficult to achieve and group therapy for stopping smoking has only a small probability of success. From an intention‐to‐treat perspective, if yoga is as effective as reported in currently published meta‐analyses, then yoga could be considered among the strongest lifestyle interventions for reducing CVD risk. With more individualized estimates and recommendations, providers can better predict CVD risk and manage prevention more effectively, particularly among different ethnic groups who may be at higher risk of CVD and can benefit from early CVD risk discussion. 47 Patients themselves can become more informed and involved in their own health and lifestyle choices.

Tailored recommendations for managing CVD risk have the potential to inform practice, improve care, and reduce healthcare expenditures. Our analysis supports the findings of several large‐scale studies that CVD risk can be modified by lifestyle changes. Additional research can take into account adherence to management strategies as well as investigate the effects of multiple interventions. As the interventions we have included are relatively low cost, a priority for future research is to analyze the effect of these management strategies on quality of life, costs (ie, affordability), and cost‐effectiveness (ie, value for money).

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111HBSAr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA guideline preamble and intended use — American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) clinical practice guidelines are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), are the official policy of the ACC and AHA, and should not replace clinical judgment; the focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113Loper]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — treatment thresholds and statin efficacy indicators: The writing committee endorsed the evidence-based findings regarding indicators of efficacy, including ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high-intensity statin therapy doses and 30% to 49% reduction for moderate-intensity doses. It judged it appropriate to continue to provide levels of LDL-C or "thresholds", in terms of both percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline and absolute on-treatment LDL-C measurement, which, if not achieved by adherent patients, would serve as factors to consider in decision-making regarding further therapy. Throughout this guidance, absolute LDL-C levels are considered as "thresholds" for considering the addition of nonstatin therapies, and not LDL-C goals, and these are not firm triggers for adding medication but are factors that may be considered within the broader context of an individual patient's clinical situation.

### Improving prevention strategies for cardiometabolic disease [^115ZpbHH]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

There is a growing burden of cardiometabolic disease in many parts of the world. Despite some progress in its prevention, more can be done to tackle risks of its development in the community and in different specialty clinics. Currently, the identification and management of those at elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes or with conditions such as fatty liver disease remains fragmented and is not linked to constructive lifestyle advice. In this Perspective, we argue for a more consistent weight-management approach, alongside a holistic assessment of the risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases, offering patients a range of simple or more-intensive evidence-based lifestyle options in an empathetic manner, with encouragement for repeated attempts and a willingness to embrace failure.

### The rise and fall of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112E294o]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide and is generally considered effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.
