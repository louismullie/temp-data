## Question

How is a rheumatoid flare diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a rheumatoid arthritis flare is diagnosed, integrating objective metrics, clinical judgment, and patient-reported outcomes into a reasoning process, and wants to see the step-by-step thinking with verification and corrections where needed, including citations, placed before punctuation marks, that support each step of reasoning.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual anchor, because if I get the definition wrong everything downstream will wobble; OMERACT frames an RA flare as a worsening of disease activity that, if persistent, would prompt initiation or change of therapy, with persistence and duration being core elements, so I should keep that "if persistent" clause front and center to avoid overcalling transient noise as flare [^115gStGE].

> Next, I should review standardized quantitative criteria, and the most reproducible trial-defined signal remains a DAS28 increase of greater than 1.2, or greater than 0.6 if baseline DAS28 is at least 3.2, but wait, let me verify performance characteristics because sensitivity without specificity can mislead; after biologic discontinuation these DAS28 thresholds are highly sensitive, around 88–100%, yet only modestly specific, around 57–65%, against investigator-defined flares, which means I need corroboration beyond a single-visit score jump [^113zzW2N] [^114teB4o] [^1161RQ5X] [^1142fszf].

> I will now examine the objective clinical and laboratory components that underpin those scores, and I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing trial entry criteria to flare diagnostics; tender and swollen joint counts and acute phase reactants (CRP or ESR) are the backbone of DAS28, while RA trial baselines often require at least six tender and six swollen joints to define active disease rather than flare per se, and multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) can complement by stratifying relapse risk, though I should confirm it's used for prediction and monitoring rather than as a standalone flare definition [^115cf8oM] [^1142fszf] [^115z4HfA].

> Hold on, let me not jump past the patient voice; patient-reported flare instruments like FLARE-RA demonstrate construct validity and correlate with DAS28, RAPID-3, RAID and HAQ, and observational data show pain intensity and patient-perceived swollen joints are principal drivers of self-declared flares, but wait, I should double-check a prior inclination to require pain greater than 3 out of 10 as a criterion because that threshold derives from a validated gout flare definition, not RA, so I must not overextend that gout-specific cutpoint into RA and instead rely on RA-specific PROs and domains such as pain, stiffness, fatigue, participation and persistence captured by FLARE-RA and related PROM frameworks [^114kX1Yn] [^115RA4kG] [^115gSGcJ] [^113Po4ni].

> Let me consider temporal persistence, because a single peak can be random variation; in constant-treatment cohorts, DAS28-based flare criteria are met surprisingly often yet mostly represent isolated spikes, whereas sustained flares across visits are much less frequent, so I should confirm worsening over at least two assessments, often about four weeks apart, to better separate signal from noise [^115m4CoJ] [^113Noh3g] [^114teB4o].

> I need to check imaging's role when exam and symptoms do not align; ultrasound or MRI can corroborate active synovitis or uncover erosive progression that strengthens the case for a true inflammatory flare, so in discordant cases I should use imaging selectively to validate inflammation rather than relying solely on PROs or a single DAS28 shift [^112UMgqu] [^117ThNf6].

> Hold on, I should verify how investigator judgment fits, because it is the clinical gold standard in many trials; investigator-defined flare requires worsening that necessitates treatment beyond permitted therapy, and compared with DAS28-based definitions it is generally more stringent, which explains why DAS28 detects more events with higher sensitivity but lower specificity, so clinician integration of trajectory, exam, labs, and patient impact remains essential [^114teB4o] [^1161RQ5X] [^1142fszf].

> Let me now synthesize this into a pragmatic diagnostic sequence without overreliance on any single domain; first, screen based on patient-reported worsening in pain, stiffness, swelling or fatigue, next, quantify with DAS28 and joint counts and document change from baseline, then, confirm persistence by reassessing in roughly four weeks if clinically safe, after that, corroborate with CRP or ESR and add ultrasound or MRI when there is discordance, finally, integrate the objective and patient-reported impact to decide whether the worsening is meaningful enough that, if it persists, it warrants therapy modification as per the OMERACT construct [^114teB4o] [^113zzW2N] [^112UMgqu] [^115gStGE] [^114kX1Yn].

> But wait, what if low disease activity blunts my tools; FLARE-RA shows a floor effect and patients in LDA might report impactful symptoms that are not fully captured by DAS28, and there is known patient–clinician discordance where patients weight pain and systemic features more than objective signs, so I should double-check for comorbid nonarticular pain syndromes, which are common in early RA and can depress remission rates, to avoid misclassifying noninflammatory pain exacerbations as inflammatory flares [^114kX1Yn] [^115RA4kG] [^1158UVLN] [^1148Qgpi].

> Next, I should review context-specific nuances, because flare ascertainment differs after therapy de-escalation; following biologic withdrawal, investigator flares typically occur at higher disease activity thresholds and later than DAS28-based flares, and flares in that setting can track with increased radiographic progression, so I need to weigh the structural risk when judging whether a flare is present and whether to reinstitute or escalate therapy [^115m4CoJ] [^115iAb9C] [^116EqpHL].

> I will now examine emerging biomarkers that might refine pre-flare detection, acknowledging they are investigational; longitudinal transcriptomics identified preinflammatory mesenchymal, or PRIME, cells that expand one to two weeks before clinical flare and single-cell work in remission versus flare supports peripheral blood biomarkers as feasible surveillance tools, but I should confirm these are not yet ready for routine diagnostic use despite their mechanistic appeal [^115VsixY] [^113zVqbH].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis of an RA flare rests on integrated evidence of objective worsening, such as DAS28 increase with supportive joint counts and inflammatory markers, confirmation of persistence over serial assessments, meaningful patient-reported impact across pain, stiffness, fatigue and function, and clinician judgment about whether the trajectory, if persistent, warrants treatment change, with imaging deployed when clinical and patient inputs diverge, and with caution to avoid conflating transient variation or nonarticular pain with true inflammatory flares [^115gStGE] [^113zzW2N] [^114teB4o] [^112UMgqu] [^114kX1Yn].

---

Diagnosing a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flare requires a **multimodal approach** that integrates patient-reported symptoms, objective clinical findings, laboratory markers, and imaging, while excluding alternative causes such as infection or medication non-adherence [^notfound]. The most reliable method is a **DAS28 increase > 1.2 or > 0.6 if DAS28 ≥ 3.2** [^113zzW2N] between visits, supported by elevated ESR/CRP and ultrasound/MRI evidence of synovitis [^112UMgqu]. Patient-reported tools (e.g. FLARE-RA, RAPID3) [^114kX1Yn] and physician global assessment add context, but clinical judgment remains essential to avoid overtreatment from transient fluctuations [^113zzW2N].

---

## Clinical features and patient-reported symptoms

RA flares are characterized by symptoms that significantly affect daily functioning and quality of life, including **increased joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and tenderness**, often with morning stiffness lasting > 30 minutes [^1148Qgpi] [^115RA4kG]. They are also accompanied by fatigue, malaise, low-grade fever, and a general feeling of illness [^1148Qgpi], as well as functional impairment — including reduced ability to perform daily activities, social withdrawal, and emotional distress [^1148Qgpi] [^114MoS3w]. Patients often report a prodrome of fatigue and flu-like symptoms preceding the flare, followed by intense, persistent pain and swelling that prompt medical consultation [^1148Qgpi] [^113zPP9X].

---

## Objective clinical assessment

Objective clinical assessment includes a structured evaluation of joint inflammation and overall disease activity, with **tender and swollen joint counts (TJC and SJC)** as core measures [^112qeuM5]. The physician global assessment, typically recorded on a visual analog scale (VAS), provides context [^114MoS3w]. Composite indices such as **DAS28, CDAI, and SDAI** quantify disease activity and help identify flares [^1142fszf].

---

## Laboratory markers

Laboratory markers provide objective evidence of inflammation and disease activity, with **elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)** commonly seen during flares [^113CVocT]. C-reactive protein (**CRP**) levels are strongly associated with active inflammation and flares [^112Tm7nz]. Autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) may be elevated, although they are not specific to flares [^112qeuM5].

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging techniques are valuable for detecting **subclinical inflammation** and joint damage:

- **Ultrasound**: Sensitive for detecting synovitis, joint effusions, and erosions, even when clinical examination is normal [^112UMgqu].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Highly sensitive for detecting synovitis, bone marrow edema, and early erosions, providing detailed information on joint inflammation [^112UMgqu].

- **Radiography**: Useful for detecting chronic joint damage and erosions, although less sensitive for early inflammation [^117ThNf6].

---

## Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)

PROMs are essential for capturing the **patient perspective** on disease activity and flare severity:

- **FLARE-RA questionnaire**: Validated tool for detecting recent or current flares, with good reliability and correlation with clinical measures [^114kX1Yn] [^115gSGcJ].

- **Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3)**: Widely used PROM that correlates with disease activity and patient-reported flares [^114kX1Yn] [^115gSGcJ].

- **Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)**: Measures functional disability and correlates with flare severity [^114kX1Yn] [^115gSGcJ].

---

## Differentiating flares from other conditions

Distinguish RA flares from mimics by **ruling out infection** through clinical evaluation, appropriate laboratory testing, and imaging when indicated [^113CVocT]. Assess medication adherence, as non-adherence can precipitate worsening symptoms, and evaluate comorbid conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and gout that may produce similar symptoms [^112vfWzV] [^112qeuM5].

---

## Standardized criteria and guidelines

Several **standardized criteria and guidelines** are available to assist clinicians in diagnosing RA flares:

- **OMERACT flare definition**: Flare is defined as any worsening of disease activity that would, if persistent, lead to initiation or change of therapy [^115gStGE].

- **DAS28-based criteria**: Increase in DAS28 score > 1.2 or > 0.6 if DAS28 ≥ 3.2 is commonly used to define flares [^113zzW2N].

- **ACR/EULAR guidelines**: Provide comprehensive recommendations for assessing and managing RA flares, emphasizing the importance of patient-reported outcomes and clinical judgment [^113MWpKS] [^116FUD6g].

---

## Emerging biomarkers and novel diagnostic tools

Emerging biomarkers and novel tools may enhance flare detection, including circulating preinflammatory mesenchymal (PRIME) cells identified by RNA sequencing as potential early indicators of impending flares [^115VsixY] and the **multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score**, a composite biomarker that correlates with disease activity and may predict flares [^115z4HfA]. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides detailed insights into immune cell activation and cytokine expression during flares [^113zVqbH].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-physician communication

Effective flare assessment and management rely on **clinical judgment** — integrating clinical findings, laboratory results, imaging, and patient-reported symptoms — and on **patient-physician communication**, which ensures accurate symptom reporting, adherence to treatment, and timely intervention during flares [^114GNqFu] [^1148Qgpi].

---

Diagnosing a rheumatoid arthritis flare requires a **comprehensive approach** integrating patient-reported symptoms, objective clinical assessment, laboratory markers, and imaging. Standardized criteria and emerging biomarkers can improve accuracy, but clinical judgment and patient-physician communication remain essential [^114MoS3w] [^113zVqbH].

### Validation of FLARE-RA, a self-administered tool to detect recent or current rheumatoid arthritis flare [^114kX1Yn]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to validate the measurement properties and detection performance of the FLARE-RA questionnaire in a longitudinal prospective study.

- **Methods**: To validate the FLARE-RA self-administered questionnaire, a prospective trial was conducted involving rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The study documented: 1) Content and construct validity through factor analysis, and convergent validity using Pearson's correlation with Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID-3) questionnaire, RA Impact of Disease (RAID) score, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). 2) Reliability assessment using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot. 3) Feasibility of use. Patient examinations and questionnaire collections occurred at baseline, three months, and weekly intervals in between for RAPID-3.

- **Results**: A total of 138 patients were recruited from 13 centers, with a demographic composition of 81.9% women, mean age of 57.4 years, mean DAS28 of 2.9, mean C-reactive protein level of 6.2 mg/liter, 84.4% rheumatoid factor positive, 78.0% anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive, and 78.8% with erosive disease. At baseline, the mean ± SD FLARE-RA score was 2.3 ± 2.3. The content and construct validity of FLARE-RA were found to be good. A substantial floor effect was observed, though no ceiling effect was noted. Principal components analysis identified one domain, which was further divided into two subdomains: physical and emotional. The FLARE-RA total score demonstrated correlations with DAS28 (r = 0.63, P < 0.001), RAID (r = 0.80, P < 0.001), RAPID-3 (r = 0.77, P < 0.001), and HAQ (r = 0.53, P < 0.001). The ICC for reliability was 0.94 (95% c).

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^113zzW2N]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the development of disease flare criteria is an ongoing effort, serving relevant purposes such as evaluating the duration of response after medication withdrawal. Additionally, the flare rate could be a standard outcome measure for clinical research assessing stable treatment conditions. In this context, Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) has launched an initiative aimed at defining flare. A preliminary investigation of six proposed Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)–based criteria identified an increase in DAS28 > 1.2 or > 0.6, if DAS28 ≥ 3.2, as the most discriminating and valid criterion.

- **Significance & innovations**: Two specific phases of the ACT‐RAY study offer a unique opportunity to investigate relevant aspects of flares:
	1. Assessment of the flare rate (according to published criteria) between weeks 24 and 52, during which a large patient subgroup received constant treatment.
	2. Comparison (using sensitivity and specificity) of the flare criteria implicitly used by the investigators with published criteria in the second year. During this period, patients reaching sustained DAS28 remission discontinued tocilizumab (TCZ) and subsequently other treatments, which were restarted after investigators diagnosed a disease flare based on their clinical judgment.

### Sohonos [^112aGXL3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for adults and pediatric patients 14 years and older is structured as follows:

- **Daily dose**: The recommended Sohonos daily dosage is 5 mg. This daily dosing should be stopped when flare-up dosing begins.

- **Flare-up dose**: For adults and pediatric patients 14 years and older, the recommended Sohonos flare-up dosage is 20 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg daily for 8 weeks (for a total of 12 weeks of flare-up treatment), even if symptoms resolve earlier. After this period, return to a daily dosing of 5 mg.

	- If during the course of flare-up treatment the patient experiences marked worsening of the original flare-up site or another flare-up at a new location, restart the 12-week flare-up dosing at 20 mg daily. For flare-up symptoms that have not resolved at the end of the 12-week period, the 10 mg daily dosage may be extended in 4-week intervals until the flare-up symptoms resolve. If new flare-up symptoms occur after the 5 mg daily dosing is resumed, flare-up dosing may be restarted.

For pediatric patients aged 8 to 13 years for females and aged 10 to 13 years for males:

- **Daily dose**: The recommended Sohonos daily dosage is weight-based, ranging from 2.5 mg to 5 mg daily. Stop daily dosing when flare-up dosing begins.

- **Flare-up dose**: The recommended flare-up Sohonos dosage is also weight-based. The initial flare-up dosage should be administered once daily for 4 weeks, followed by a lower flare-up dosage once daily for 8 weeks.

### Patient reported outcome measures for rheumatoid arthritis disease activity: Rasch measurement theory to identify items and domains [^115gSGcJ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

A questionnaire was created based on the items from 10 legacy PROMs identified and reviewed in a systematic review (see Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online). These include the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index-5 (RADAI5), Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI), RADAI-SF, Patient-based Disease Activity Score 2 (PDAS2), Patient-reported Outcome Clinical Arthritis Activity (PRO-CLARA), Global Arthritis Score (GAS), Patient Activity Score (PAS), Patient Activity Score-II (PAS-II), Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), and Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 4 (RAPID4).

Also included were the items from two PROMs measuring the level of flare: the Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare Questionnaire (RA-FQ) and FLARE-RA (which includes FLARE-RA Old, FLARE-RA Arthritis, and FLARE-RA General Symptoms).

The items from The Rapid Assessment of Disease Activity in Rheumatology (RADAR), the PROM-score, and the foot-specific RADAI-F5 were included, as were fatigue items included in the PAS and PAS-II assessments, the HAQ (PDAS2, PAS), and the multidimensional HAQ (MDHAQ), which are used in RAPID3 and RAPID4. The HAQ also has an additional pain item. RA-FQ has additional items about having a flare and the duration of the flare.

A draft questionnaire containing these items was discussed with two groups of people living with rheumatoid arthritis (plwRA): one meeting with J.D. and S.C., and another with a focus group convened by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS). From these discussions, items concerning discomfort when walking, standing, and exercising, as well as fear of falling when walking, were identified.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^115Y4mhL]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of rheumatoid arthritis, the ACR 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of methotrexate monotherapy over the combination of methotrexate plus a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD. This is particularly advised for patients with moderate-to-high disease activity who are conventional synthetic DMARD-treated but methotrexate-naïve.

### Olumiant [^115cf8oM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Olumiant 2 mg once daily were assessed in two confirmatory phase 3 trials. These trials were randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies involving patients with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria. Patients over 18 years of age were eligible if at least six tender and six swollen joints were present at baseline. The two studies, identified as Studies RA-3 and RA-4, evaluated Olumiant 2 mg and baricitinib 4 mg.

- **Study RA-3 (NCT01721057)**: This 24-week trial included 684 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs). Patients received Olumiant 2 mg or 4 mg once daily or a placebo added to existing background cDMARD treatment. From week 16, non-responding patients could be transitioned to receive baricitinib 4 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12.

- **Study RA-4 (NCT01721044)**: This was a 24-week trial consisting of 527 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, with or without other biologic DMARDs (TNFi-IR). Patients received Olumiant 2 mg or baricitinib 4 mg once daily or a placebo, added to background cDMARD treatment. From week 16, non-responding patients could be transitioned to receive baricitinib 4 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12.

### Short-term risk of cardiovascular events in people newly diagnosed with gout [^114fXNk5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

- **Study design and study period**: A self-controlled case series (SCCS) study evaluated the temporal association between the first diagnosis of gout — typically a flare consultation at which gout could be diagnosed in primary or secondary care — and cardiovascular events. In the SCCS study, eligible patients, those with both an exposure and an outcome, act as their own controls. Comparisons are made within individuals and not between them, thereby accounting for fixed, time-invariant confounding. A cohort study provided estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular events following the first consultation where gout was diagnosed. The study period spanned from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2020.

- **Data source**: Linked primary care, hospitalization, and mortality data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and Office for National Statistics (ONS) databases, respectively. CPRD-GOLD contains anonymized patient data on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, prescriptions, diagnoses, and test results originating during routine care from over 18 million individuals in England.

- **Source population**: Patients were newly diagnosed with gout at 18 years or older. These individuals contributed research-quality data to CPRD-GOLD, with their primary care records linked to HES and ONS datasets. To minimize the risk of including prevalent gout cases as incident, patients with a new diagnosis of gout were included at least two years after their registration at the practice, without any prior prescription.

### Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes flares in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in remission or inactive disease on medication [^1127SuTh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

In 988 cases with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) admitted from July 2020 until June 2021 to the German Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology, serology for COVID-19 was determined in 178 cases. Of these, 13 samples were positive. Six patients had no signs of arthritis flare but a recent history of other symptoms compatible with infection with SARS-CoV-2. Two patients had signs of arthritis flare after discontinuation of medication following the diagnosis of COVID-19. The remaining five patients, who experienced a flare after infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite no change in medication, are presented here.

Laboratory data and treatment details for the flare are summarized in the available tables. No patient showed any sign of uveitis at the time of flare. Prior to admission, the patients had been seen regularly, typically every three months, by their local pediatric rheumatologists, where inactive disease status was confirmed.

- **Table 1: Demographic and clinical data of the patients**.
- **Table 2: Clinical and laboratory values, and treatment of flare for the patients**.

- **Patient cases**: Case 1 describes a seven-year-old girl diagnosed with extended oligoarthritis at the age of two years and ten months, initially presenting with arthritis in her knees, ankles, and later involving the left subtalar joint and both temporomandibular joints. She had been treated with methotrexate and adalimumab. Medication was stopped approximately 18 months ago, and she continued well without clinical signs of arthritis. She presented, off all medications, with swelling of the right ankle. Approximately three weeks prior to admission, several cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^115m4CoJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study contributes to the discussion about defining flares in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as we analyzed data from a treatment strategy study with a four-weekly visit schedule. This schedule is more frequent than in most published studies, which rely on assessments every three months. In a study phase characterized by constant treatment, stable disease activity, and minimal efficacy-related withdrawals, the DAS28-based flare criteria from a published validation study were met quite often; however, they were mostly in relation to disease activity fluctuations isolated to a single visit, potentially due to normal variability of clinical assessments. Recent modeling work supports the existence of high random variability in DAS28 over time. Therefore, utilizing a trend of DAS28 values over more than one visit, similar to the approach used by many investigators in the present study, may be more useful than single assessments in understanding disease progression. Similar incidences of flare have been observed in patients receiving constant treatment of anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.

After biologic agent discontinuation, investigator flares were diagnosed at fairly high disease activity levels, which was also the case for the patients' assessments. Investigator judgment used to identify flares was more stringent than the DAS28-based definitions, as indicated by high sensitivity but rather low specificity. Understanding the correct time to respond to disease flares without overtreating requires further study.

### Relationship between gout flare states and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116F5Bu9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

It is important to note that the study population was 93% male. Although this reflects a typical gout trial population, women often experience higher disease severity, have more negative illness perceptions, and experience a greater impact on daily activities. Although the number of women in our study was too small to enable analysis by gender, we would expect the observed effects to be even more pronounced in women.

These data contribute to our understanding of the impact and burden of gout flares in people with gout, highlighting their concern about this core clinical manifestation of the disease. In the long term, excellent serum urate control is important. However, it is also essential that healthcare professionals support people with gout to prevent and manage flares as a core part of gout management.

Strengths of this study include the standardized study protocols, prospective gout flare event ascertainment, and use of outcomes relevant to patients. Limitations include some loss to follow-up, albeit minimal; the use of subjective assessments; and the short study design, which did not allow for assessment beyond one year. It is well recognized that gout flares can paradoxically increase after starting ULT. Given this peak in flares after starting ULT, it is not surprising that LDA and PASS are hard to achieve in the first six months of starting ULT, even with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis with colchicine. Over time, there is a gradual reduction in gout flares such that, by the second year of ULT, if target serum urate is achieved, flares may cease altogether.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^114teB4o]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the flare rate using published criteria (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28–2] increase between visits of > 1.2 or > 0.6 if DAS28 ≥ 3.2) in patients receiving constant treatment, we compared published flare criteria to criteria used by study investigators after biologic treatment discontinuation in the ACT-RAY study.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 553) were randomized to add tocilizumab to ongoing methotrexate or switch to tocilizumab plus placebo. If DAS28 ≤ 3.2 occurred at week 24, treatment remained constant until week 52; here we assessed the DAS28–2 flare rate. Between weeks 52 and 104, patients in sustained remission (DAS28 < 2.6 at 2 consecutive visits 12 weeks apart) discontinued tocilizumab and were assessed every 4 weeks. Per protocol, flare was defined as a worsening of disease activity that required treatment beyond the permitted therapy based on investigator opinions (investigator flare) and was compared with the DAS28–2 definition.

After tocilizumab discontinuation, DAS28–2 was sensitive (88–100%) but not specific (57–65%) for detecting investigator flare. Under constant treatment, DAS28–2 criteria were met in 136 cases per 100 patient-years despite stable disease activity. Sustained flares were infrequent. Other DAS28-based criteria led to similar conclusions.

DAS28-based flare occurred more often than investigator-defined flares after biologic agent discontinuation. More stringent criteria may be more appropriate for clinical practice.

### Appropriate and effective management of rheumatoid arthritis [^117A3EfW]. Annals of the rheumatic diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Early referral, within less than three months, and early DMARD treatment can alter the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Once the disease becomes aggressive, it is much harder to treat, and improvements will not be as significant as they would have been with earlier treatment. The latest strategies and treatments enable remission to be achieved in many more patients than formerly.

### Brief report: Validation of a definition of flare in patients with established gout [^113Po4ni]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to perform external validation of a provisional definition of disease flare in patients with gout.

Five hundred nine patients with gout were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during routine clinical care visits at 17 international sites. Data were collected to classify patients as experiencing or not experiencing a gout flare according to a provisional definition. A local expert rheumatologist conducted the final independent adjudication of gout flare status. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to determine the diagnostic performance of gout flare definitions.

The mean age of the patients was 57.5 years (± 13.9 years), and 89% were male. The definition requiring fulfillment of at least 3 of 4 criteria (patient-defined gout flare, pain at rest score of > 3 on a 0–10-point numerical rating scale, presence of at least one swollen joint, and presence of at least one warm joint) was 85% sensitive and 95% specific in confirming the presence of a gout flare, with an accuracy of 92%. The ROC area under the curve was 0.97. The definition based on a classification and regression tree algorithm (entry point, pain at rest score > 3, followed by patient-defined flare "yes") was 73% sensitive and 96% specific.

In conclusion, the definition of gout flare that requires fulfillment of at least 3 of 4 patient-reported criteria has now been validated to be sensitive, specific, and accurate for gout flares, as demonstrated using a large independent international patient sample.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rheumatoid arthritis, specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a chest X-ray (CXR) and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

### Significant others' influence on participation in everyday life - the perspectives of persons with early diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis [^112k8Ur7]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the role of significant others in relation to the participation of persons with early diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in everyday life.

Materials and methods: Fifty-nine individuals participated in this interview study. The inclusion criteria required participants to have three years' experience with the diagnosis and be of working age. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using the critical incident technique (CIT), and the data were analyzed using content analysis.

- **Categories revealed**:
	1. **Activity adaptations**: "My early RA causes activity adaptations for us all", referring to the person and significant others modifying activities.
	2. **Balance between shortfalls and participation**: Making the significant others balance between needing help and feeling involved in activities.
	3. **Physical interactions with significant others**: Referring to both the problematic and manageable impact RA could have on body contact.
	4. **Emotions in relation to activities with others**: Participants described feelings of failing others and anxiety about future activities.

For persons with early diagnosed RA, significant others can be both hindering and facilitating in their participation in everyday life. Clinically, it is valuable to identify how significant others can be involved in the rehabilitation process to enhance participation early in the disease process. Significant others of persons with rheumatoid arthritis can facilitate as well as hinder participation in everyday life, even early in the condition.

### Characterizing nonarticular pain at early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis: Evolution over the first year of treatment and impact on remission in a prospective real-world early rheumatoid arthritis cohort [^1158UVLN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, nonarticular pain (NAP), particularly regional, is common in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and negatively impacts remission at 1 year. Regional NAP persisted in nearly half of patients by 1 year of follow-up. Widespread NAP was less common at diagnosis and evolved into regional NAP or resolved in most of our early RA cohort by 1 year. Our findings raise the possibility of an RA-related mechanism for NAP that warrants further study. This study should alert clinicians to look for NAP in their patients with RA, which can potentially help tailor treatment and identify those at higher risk of not achieving treatment targets in the initial year of RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention: An emerging paradigm shift [^112Tm7nz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently diagnosed and treated when an individual presents with signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (IA), as well as other features such as autoantibodies and/or imaging findings, that provide sufficient confidence that the individual has RA-like IA (e.g. meeting established classification criteria) that warrants therapeutic intervention. However, it is now known that there is a stage of seropositive RA during which circulating biomarkers and other factors (e.g. joint symptoms) can be used to predict if and when an individual who does not currently have IA may develop future clinically apparent IA and classifiable RA. The discovery of the "pre-RA" stage of seropositive disease has led to the development of several clinical trials in which individuals are studied to identify ways to delay or prevent the onset of clinically apparent IA/RA.

This review focuses on several issues pertinent to understanding the prevention of RA:

- **Pathogenesis of pre-RA development**: Discusses the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development of RA.
- **Prediction of the likelihood and timing**: Explores methods for predicting the future occurrence of classifiable RA.
- **Review of clinical trials**: An overview of completed and ongoing clinical trials in RA prevention, including challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed.

Furthermore, this review discusses challenges and opportunities to be addressed to effect a paradigm shift in RA, where in the near future, proactive risk assessment focused on the prevention of RA will become a public health strategy in much the same manner as cardiovascular disease is managed today.

### Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes flares in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in remission or inactive disease on medication [^111XD5h4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Case 2 presents a 17-year-old adolescent male, initially diagnosed with rheumatoid-factor negative polyarthritis at 11 years and six months of age. His treatment included intraarticular steroid injections and methotrexate, followed by etanercept, adalimumab, and tocilizumab during his disease course. Six months before admission, he switched to baricitinib, resulting in a complete response confirmed as inactive by his physician. However, three weeks post-COVID-19, he developed arthritis in both ankle and subtalar joints, with clinical symptoms being inapparent, confirmed by antigen testing after his brother developed a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Case 3 involves a nine-year-old girl, diagnosed with rheumatoid-factor negative arthritis at ten months old. Her initial treatment involved methotrexate and intraarticular steroid injections, with etanercept added at three years old to manage occasional mild flares, the most recent at seven years when dosages were adjusted. She presented with arthritis in both knees and the left ankle — ongoing for three months — after her entire family's COVID-19 infection, confirmed by antigen testing at that time, during which she experienced fever and mild diarrhea.

Case 4 describes an 18-year-old adolescent male diagnosed with enthesitis-associated arthritis at 11 years of age. His treatment included methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and low-dose prednisolone until discontinuation at 17 years. He continued to do well without medication until he developed an infection.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^1139UKZq]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, particularly in managing acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating colchicine within 12 hours of flare onset. The recommended dosage is a 1 mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg one hour later on day 1. Alternatives include using an NSAID (plus PPIs if appropriate), administering oral corticosteroids (30–35 mg/day of equivalent prednisolone for 3–5 days), or performing articular aspiration and administering intra-articular corticosteroids. These are considered first-line options for managing acute flares.

### Impact of flare on radiographic progression after etanercept continuation, tapering or withdrawal in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116EqpHL]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The structural consequences of flare after dose reduction or discontinuation of biologic DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieve remission are unclear. We compared the incidence of radiographic progression in patients with RA who did and did not experience flare after etanercept (ETN) reduction or withdrawal.

Eligible adults with moderately active RA, despite MTX treatment, received ETN 50 mg plus MTX weekly in a 36-week, open-label induction period. Patients achieving sustained low disease activity by week 36 were randomized to ETN 50 mg plus MTX, ETN 25 mg plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX in a 52-week, double-blind maintenance period. In post hoc analyses, radiographic progression (Δ modified total Sharp score ≥ 0.5 units/year) was compared in patients with and without flare, based on DAS28 relapse (main analysis), and clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index relapse (sensitivity analyses). Findings from patients receiving full- and reduced-dose combination therapy were pooled for comparison with those from patients receiving MTX only.

Significantly more patients receiving MTX monotherapy experienced flare, defined as DAS28 relapse (62% vs. 21%; P < 0.0001) and radiographic progression (17% vs. 9%; P < 0.001), than patients receiving full- or reduced-dose combination therapy in the double-blind period. Patients with flare, defined as clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index relapse, had higher rates of radiographic progression than those without flare in the full- or reduced-dose combination therapy group (P < 0.01).

### Developing a standardized definition for disease "flare" in rheumatoid arthritis (OMERACT 9 Special Interest Group) [^115gStGE]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Traditional outcome measures in randomized controlled trials (RCT) include well-established response criteria as well as ACR EULAR responses using Disease Activity Score 44 (DAS44)/DAS28 to assess improvement; however, a measure to assess worsening of disease has yet to be developed. This special interest group (SIG) was established to develop an evidence-based, consensus-driven standard definition of "flare" in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

At OMERACT 8, the need for a standardized definition of RA flare was recognized; interested individuals developed a proposal to form a SIG. A literature review was performed to identify publications and abstracts with flare definitions applied in RA, JIA, and lupus RCT as well as concerning patient perspectives on disease worsening. A SIG was held at OMERACT 9 with breakout sessions for patients and investigators.

The RA flare SIG was attended by about 120 participants, including 11 patients. Patients and investigators held separate breakout sessions to discuss various aspects of disease worsening. The following consensus was obtained at OMERACT 9: a working definition of flare should indicate worsening of disease activity (88%), persistence, and duration as critical elements (77%), and consideration of change or increase in therapy (74%).

A working definition of RA flare was developed based on these votes: flare is any worsening of disease activity that would, if persistent, in most cases lead to initiation or change of therapy; and a flare represents a cluster of symptoms of sufficient duration.

### Short-term recovery trajectories of acute flares in knee pain: A UK-Netherlands multicenter prospective cohort analysis [^112xVAdH]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Low credibility.

The age of participants in our study may be important. Studies of long-term symptom trajectories in knee pain have recruited participants with a mean age ranging from 56 to 71 years. The age of participants in the study was at the lower end of this range (median age 55 years) and comparable with that of the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee cohort of early osteoarthritis. Following the exclusion of potential participants with a history of inflammatory/crystal arthropathy, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain syndrome, our study findings most likely reflect acute flares in relatively early knee osteoarthritis. Thus, our observations provide some empirical support for the qualitative finding of Hawker et al. that flares may be present in an early phase of osteoarthritis.

In this study, acute flares were self-declared by participants, a pragmatic decision in the absence of more robust criteria, and one with some face and construct validity. Nevertheless, the flares are still likely to represent heterogeneous underlying pathophysiologic processes. Future studies using imaging to assess the role of joint inflammation, for example, may be insightful. The resolution of pain appeared to track the resolution of self-reported swelling, and those participants with the most rapid pain recovery had the least swelling at baseline, consistent with the proposal of Marty et al. that knee effusion is an important (but not essential) component of knee osteoarthritis flares. We acknowledge that the 5-day study period was short, and future studies with longer follow-up could provide more comprehensive insights.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The epidemiology, diagnosis, and optimal management of gout present significant challenges. Correctly diagnosing gout is particularly difficult, as it initially manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis and progresses to chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares over time. Associated conditions like tophi and renal stones may also occur alongside arthritis. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven gout diagnosis are low.

Gout shares symptoms with osteoarthritis and pseudogout, such as involvement of the great toe and other lower extremity joints. A presumptive gout diagnosis based on big toe pain history and borderline high serum urate levels can be problematic. To improve diagnostic accuracy, clinicians should document additional acute synovitis features, radiographic signs of overhanging margins and punched-out erosions specific to gout, and remain vigilant for features of differential diagnoses such as osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria are often used for classifying acute gouty arthritis, yet they prove inadequate for in-office diagnoses in approximately 21% of cases. Joint, bursa, or tophus aspiration attempts should be made to confirm the diagnosis, as the presence of urate crystals in synovial fluid unequivocally confirms gout, and its treatment is typically life-long.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^115iAb9C]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

After discontinuation of one of the study drugs according to the protocol, most patients experienced an investigator flare (n = 200; Kaplan-Meier estimate 85% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 80%–89%]; median time to flare: 87 days [95% CI 85–113 days]), with the majority occurring following discontinuation of the first drug (TCZ). Mean values for disease activity measures at the time of TCZ discontinuation and at flare, respectively, were as follows: DAS28-ESR 1.6 and 4.4; tender joint count 1.9 and 9.1; swollen joint count 0.64 and 4.6; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index 0.44 and 0.87; and patient global assessment of disease activity (100-mm visual analog scale) 13.4 mm and 34.6 mm. Of the patients with an investigator flare, 94% also had a DAS28–2 flare at the same visit. For consecutive DAS28–2 flares including the previous visit and at the two previous visits, the percentages were 52% and 35%, respectively. Similar patterns were observed for the other flare criteria.

DAS28-based flares were detected faster and more frequently than investigator flares (median time: 56 versus 90 days). All patients with an investigator flare had a previous or concomitant DAS28–2 flare. Comparison of the two definitions at the five pre-specified time points demonstrated high sensitivity (88–100%), low specificity (57–68%), and modest agreement.

### Mortality and immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor initiation for cancer among patients with pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis: A retrospective, comparative, cohort study [^1154hDeE]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis initiating immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer might be at risk of increased mortality, rheumatoid arthritis flares, and other immune-related adverse events (AEs). We aimed to determine whether pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis was associated with higher mortality and immune-related AE risk in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, comparative cohort study was conducted at the Mass General Brigham Integrated Health Care System and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston (MA, USA). We searched data repositories to identify all individuals who initiated immune checkpoint inhibitors from April 1, 2011, to April 21, 2021. Patients with pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis had to meet the 2010 American College of Rheumatology-European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR-EULAR) criteria. For each pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis case, we matched up to three non-rheumatoid arthritis comparators at the index date of immune checkpoint inhibitor initiation by sex (recorded as male or female), calendar year, immune checkpoint inhibitor target, and cancer type and stage. The coprimary outcomes were time from index date to death and time to the first immune-related AE, measured using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. Deaths were identified by medical record and obituary review. Rheumatoid arthritis flares and immune-related AE presence, type, and severity were determined by medical record review.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^113Noh3g]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Results

- **Patient disposition and background characteristics**: The ITT study population included 553 patients enrolled at 118 centers in 19 countries across Europe, America, and Asia. The patients' mean ± SD disease duration was 8.2 ± 8.2 years, and their mean ± SD baseline DAS28‐ESR was 6.4 ± 1.0. At week 24, 313 patients had achieved LDA. In the second year, 238 patients discontinued TCZ after reaching sustained remission and were assessed for flares in the study (Figure 1).

- **DAS28‐2 flares under constant treatment**: Disease activity between weeks 24 and 52 remained stable (mean DAS28 of 2.24 and 2.21, respectively), and less than 1% of patients withdrew for efficacy reasons. Despite this, 136 DAS28‐2 flares per 100 patient-years were recorded in 50% of patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate) with a mean DAS28 of 3.7. Flares mostly corresponded to isolated disease activity peaks, followed by a return to previous levels (Figure 2). The rate of sustained flares at two and three visits following a given reference visit (the visit of the first flare) up to week 44 was 52 and 25 per 100 patient-years, affecting 17% and 8% of patients, respectively. Over the same period, 36% of patients had at least one DAS28‐2 flare. The flare incidence based on other criteria varied, but the reduction in rates for sustained flares was similar to DAS28‐2.

Adverse reactions

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: loss of bone mineral density [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], initial flare of symptoms with management of endometriosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], convulsions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], and clinical depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Clinical trials experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Lupron depot 3.75 mg (monotherapy)

The safety of Lupron Depot 3.75 mg for the endometriosis and fibroids indications was established based on adequate and well-controlled adult studies. The safety of Lupron Depot 3.75 mg was evaluated in six clinical studies in which a total of 332 women were treated for up to six months. Women were treated with monthly intramuscular injections of Lupron Depot 3.75 mg. The population age range was 18 to 53 years.

- **Adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to study discontinuation**: In the six studies, 1.8% of women treated with Lupron Depot 3.75 mg discontinued prematurely due to hot flashes.

- **Common adverse reactions**: The safety of Lupron Depot 3.75 mg was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in 166 women with endometriosis and 166 women with uterine fibroids. Adverse reactions were reported in ≥ 5% of women in either study.

### Improved flare and remission pattern in rheumatoid arthritis over recent decades: A population-based study [^111LXVNQ]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

To assess trends in the occurrence of flares and remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over recent decades, a retrospective medical records review of each clinical visit was performed in a population-based cohort of patients with RA (age ⩾30 years; 1987 ACR criteria met in 1988–2007) to estimate flare and remission status. RA flare was defined as any worsening of RA activity leading to an initiation, change, or increase of therapy (OMERACT 9). The primary definition for remission required the absence of RA disease activity (i.e. tender joint count 0, swollen joint count 0, and ESR ≤ 10 mm/h) (OMERACT 7). All subjects were followed until death, migration, or 1 July 2012.

The study included 650 RA patients (mean age 55.8 years; 69% female) with a mean follow-up of 10.3 years. Patients were flaring at 2887 (17%) visits. There was a significant decline in the RA flare rate across disease duration (P < 0.001), predominantly in the first 5 years after diagnosis of RA. Patients diagnosed with RA in more recent years experienced fewer flares during the first few years of RA (P < 0.001). There was no difference between the sexes in trends of flare rates over time (P = 0.42). Smokers had higher flare rates than non-smokers (P = 0.047), and former smokers were not different from non-smokers (P = 0.87).

Patients diagnosed in more recent years have lower flare rates than those diagnosed in prior decades. Flare rates declined fastest in the first 5 years of disease and tended to be stable thereafter. Smoking was associated with an adverse flare profile.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis and management [^1137UiPE]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents many challenges for clinicians. The onset of the disease may be insidious, with many different symptoms and signs, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. Tests for SLE in the early stages lack specificity; those that are useful later often appear only after organ damage is manifest. Disease patterns are highly variable; flares are unpredictable and not always associated with biomarkers.

Children with SLE may have severe disease and present special management issues. Older SLE patients have complicating comorbid conditions. Therapeutic interventions have improved over recent decades, but available drugs do not adequately control the disease in many patients. Successful outcomes are limited by off-target effects, some of which become manifest with longer treatment duration, as revealed by improved survival rates.

Despite all of these challenges, advances in understanding the biological basis of SLE have translated into more effective approaches to patient care. This review considers the state of SLE diagnosis and management, with a focus on new approaches and anticipated advances.

### 'I'm hurting, I want to kill myself': Rheumatoid arthritis flare is more than a high joint count — an international patient perspective on flare where medical help is sought [^1148Qgpi]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience episodes of worsening disease activity, known as flares, which prompt them to seek clinical review or medication change. This study explored patients' perspectives on flares that prompt them to seek medication review.

Fourteen focus groups were conducted across five countries, including 67 RA patients. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis by several researchers and a patient.

Patients use the term "flare" for five different scenarios, including those that prompt medical help-seeking. Six themes were identified in this context:

- **Symptoms and early warnings**: Pain is intense, constant, and persistent, and is considered a key feature. Systemic features predominate, including fatigue, feeling generally ill (flu-like), physical and cognitive shut-down, and social withdrawal. Warning signs (prodrome) comprise fatigue and flu-like symptoms.

- **Self-management of intensifying symptoms**: Strategies include pacing, using heat/cold, resting, and increasing medication, often without medical advice.

- **Uncontrollable flare**: Defined by patients as clusters of unprovoked, persistent symptoms that halt their ability to run daily life, eventually prompting them to seek help when symptoms can't be contained.

Underlying themes include the "individual context" (e.g. different symptom clusters) and "uncertainty" (e.g. when to seek help). Patients report that the patient global visual analogue scale (VAS) does not capture flare.

Patients use "flare" for multiple events and seek help for complex clusterings of intense, unprovoked symptoms that defy self-management.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: A synthesis of the qualitative literature [^113zPP9X]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Once results are available from formal qualitative studies of the emergence of symptoms in people at risk of RA and in those with a new onset of the disease, these results can be used to inform the development of a "symptom questionnaire" to assess the frequency of symptoms and their evolution in individuals at risk of RA. Through this approach, refinement of algorithms for use in secondary care to predict RA development in patients with unclassified arthritis and patients with inflammatory joint symptoms and RA-related autoantibodies may be achieved.

Importantly, tools also need to be developed for use in primary care to direct management pathways, including determining which patients with joint-related symptoms should be investigated (e.g. with autoantibody testing or imaging) and who should be referred to a rheumatologist. The patient's history is readily available and inexpensive. Maximizing value from this history and assessing the predictive utility of its components in the earliest phases of RA can only be achieved once these components are fully understood.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^1142fszf]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). High credibility.

Patients and methods:

- **Study design and procedures**: ACT-RAY was a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (NCT00810199). Briefly, eligible patients had active RA with DAS28 using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of > 4.4 at baseline and received methotrexate (MTX) for ≥ 12 weeks, with a stable dosage of ≥ 15 mg/week. All patients received open-label TCZ 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks and were randomized to double-blind treatment with MTX or placebo at a dose corresponding to the pre-study period. Dose modifications of TCZ and MTX were allowed only for safety reasons or in the context of the treatment step-down. Stable dosages of oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were permitted.

- **After week 24**: For patients who did not achieve low disease activity (LDA; DAS28-ESR > 3.2), a treat-to-target approach was used, including the addition of open-label disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). For patients in LDA, treatment continued unchanged through week 52, except for an optional steroid reduction not below 5 mg/day of prednisone equivalents.

- **After week 52**: The strategy included a treatment step-down approach. Patients who achieved sustained clinical remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6 at 2 consecutive visits 12 weeks apart) progressively discontinued study treatments: first TCZ and subsequently, if still in sustained remission, the open-label DMARD (where present) and the blinded medication (MTX/placebo).

After treatment discontinuation, patients were monitored.

### Pain and self-reported swollen joints are main drivers of patient-reported flares in rheumatoid arthritis: Results from a 12-month observational study [^115RA4kG]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine prospectively self-reported flare characteristics and their longitudinal association with disease activity and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods included examining consecutive RA patients with a 28-joint count Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of less than 3.2 and no swollen joints at baseline, Month 6, and Month 12. Assessments included joint counts, DAS28-CRP, visual analog scale-evaluator's global assessment (EGA), and PRO. Every third month, patients completed the Flare Assessment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and RA Flare Questionnaire and disclosed self-management strategies. Flaring and non-flaring patients were compared, and longitudinal associations between self-reported flare status (yes/no) and disease activity, PRO, and treatment escalation were explored.

Results indicated that among 80 patients with RA [74% females, mean (SD) age 63 (10) years, disease duration 11 (7) years, and baseline DAS28-CRP 1.9 (0.6)], 64 (80%) reported flare at least once during the 12 months. Fifty-five percent of flares lasted less than one week. Common self-management strategies were analgesics (50%) and restricted activities (38%). Patients who reported being in flare had consistently higher disease activity measures and PRO compared to patients without flare. In a partly adjusted model, all flare domains, patient-reported swollen and tender joint counts, and disease activity measures were associated with flares. In fully adjusted analyses, present flare was independently associated with pain (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.34–2.60), patient-reported swollen joints, and elevated disease activity.

### Characterizing nonarticular pain at early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis: Evolution over the first year of treatment and impact on remission in a prospective real-world early rheumatoid arthritis cohort [^113PbR4C]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Results

Data were available from 392 patients with early RA who met the eligibility criteria after excluding those with missing data. Our study cohort was mostly female (70%) and White (80%), with a mean ± SD age of 56 ± 14 years, a mean ± SD symptoms duration of 5.1 ± 2.7 months, and a mean ± SD CDAI of 26.6 ± 13.4. Most (79%) were treated with a methotrexate‐inclusive regimen.

- **Baseline characteristics across NAP pain patterns by patients with early RA**: At baseline, more than half of the patients (n = 201, 51%) reported NAP, with most (n = 146, 73%) presenting with regional NAP. Compared with those without NAP, participants with NAP were more frequently White women who finished high school and had osteoarthritis and/or back pain and a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Compared with those without NAP, participants with baseline NAP reported higher pain and perceived stress scores. They also exhibited higher tender‐swollen joint count differences and greater discrepancies between patient global and medical doctor global assessments compared with those without NAP at baseline. These differences were often greatest in those with widespread NAP. Those with baseline NAP were less frequently seropositive. Participants with baseline widespread NAP had higher C‐reactive protein levels compared with those of the other groups.

- **Patterns over 1 year**: The point prevalence of regional NAP decreased from 37% at baseline to 27% at 12 months; widespread NAP decreased from 14% to 7%.

### Patient and physician perspectives of systemic lupus erythematosus flare: A qualitative study [^114C5tQM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares are associated with increased damage and decreased health-related quality of life. We hypothesized that there is discordance between physicians' and patients' views of SLE flare. In this study, we aimed to explore patient and physician descriptions of SLE flares.

- **Methods**: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using in-depth interviews with a purposeful sample of patients with SLE (who met 1997 American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria) and practicing rheumatologists. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using applied thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Forty-two patient participants with SLE, representing a range of SLE activity, completed interviews. The majority described flare symptoms as joint pain, fatigue, and skin issues lasting several days. Few included objective signs or laboratory measures, when available, as features of flare. We interviewed 13 rheumatologists from 10 academic and 3 community settings. The majority defined flare as increased or worsening SLE disease activity, with slightly more than half requiring objective findings. Around half of the rheumatologists included fatigue, pain, or other patient-reported symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: Patients and physicians described flare differently. Participants with SLE perceived flares as several days of fatigue, pain, and skin issues. Providers defined flares as periods of increased clinical SLE activity. Our findings suggest the definition of flare may be insufficient to integrate.

### Evaluation of the disease activity score in twenty-eight joints-based flare definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: Data from a three-year clinical trial [^1161RQ5X]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the flare rate using published criteria, specifically the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28‐2), defined as an increase between visits of > 1.2 or > 0.6 if DAS28 ≥ 3.2, in patients receiving constant treatment. The study also aimed to compare the published flare criteria to those used by study investigators after biologic treatment discontinuation in the ACT‐RAY study.

- **Methods**: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 553) were randomized to either add tocilizumab to ongoing methotrexate or switch to tocilizumab plus placebo. If a DAS28 ≤ 3.2 was achieved at week 24, treatment remained constant until week 52, and the DAS28‐2 flare rate was assessed. Between weeks 52 and 104, patients in sustained remission (DAS28 < 2.6 at two consecutive visits 12 weeks apart) discontinued tocilizumab and were assessed every four weeks. Per the protocol, a flare was defined as a worsening of disease activity requiring treatment beyond the permitted therapy based on investigator opinions (investigator flare) and was compared with the DAS28‐2 definition.

- **Results**: After discontinuing tocilizumab, the DAS28‐2 was sensitive (88–100%) but not specific (57–65%) for detecting investigator flares. Under constant treatment, DAS28‐2 criteria were met in 136 cases per 100 patient‐years despite stable disease activity. Sustained flares were infrequent. Other DAS28‐based criteria led to similar conclusions.

- **Conclusion**: DAS28‐based flares occurred more frequently than investigator-defined flares after the discontinuation of biologic agents. More stringent criteria may be more appropriate for clinical practice.

### Predicting disease severity and remission in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Are we getting closer [^111pN2vq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To summarize research on the prediction of severe disease or remission in children with juvenile arthritis, there is a need to define further steps towards developing prediction tools with sufficient accuracy for clinical use.

- **Recent findings**: High disease activity, poor patient-reported outcomes, ankle or wrist involvement, and a longer time from onset to the start of treatment herald a severe disease course and a low chance of remission. Other studies confirmed that age less than 7 years and positive ANA are the strongest predictors of uveitis development. Preliminary evidence suggests ultrasound findings may predict flare in patients with clinically inactive disease, and several new biomarkers show promise. A few prediction tools that combine predictors to estimate the chance of remission or a severe disease course in the medium-term to long-term have shown good accuracy when internally validated in the population in which they were developed.

Promising candidate tools for predicting disease severity and long-term remission in juvenile arthritis are now available. These tools need external validation in other populations and ideally formal trials to assess whether their use in practice improves patient outcomes. We are definitively getting closer, but we are not there yet.

### Multibiomarker disease activity score: An objective tool for monitoring rheumatoid arthritis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115z4HfA]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The MBDA score was found to be an appropriate discriminator of remission/low disease activity and moderate/high disease activity, according to two studies. Ma et al. reported that the baseline MBDA score and the time-integrated MBDA score discriminated between remission and non-remission at 1 year as well. Two studies found no significant association between baseline MBDA score and remission, although, according to Brahe et al, the change in MBDA score was associated with clinical remission. Hirata et al. recorded the association of MBDA remission with clinical remission.

High baseline MBDA scores were associated with significantly greater proportions of patients experiencing relapse based on the results of Ghiti Moghadam et al. and significantly higher MBDA scores were recorded in relapsed patients by Rech et al. Boeters et al. found that high MBDA scores during DMARD treatment and before treatment reduction were associated with an increased risk of relapses in patients who reduced or stopped DMARD treatments. Bouman et al. reported the borderline positive predictive value of baseline MBDA score for flare of patients with low disease activity at baseline. According to Bechman et al, baseline MBDA scores were not predictive of flare. However, a sensitivity analysis limited to flares with an increase in high disease activity determined by MBDA score (> 44) did show an association between baseline MBDA value and flare risk.

No evidence of publication bias was observed in the funnel plots for the correlations of MBDA scores with conve.

### Developing a construct to evaluate flares in rheumatoid arthritis: a conceptual report of the OMERACT RA Flare Definition Working Group [^114GNqFu]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) recognize that episodic worsening disease activity, often described as a "flare", is a common feature of RA that can contribute to impaired function and disability. However, there is no standard definition to enable the measurement of its intensity and impact. The conceptual framework of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) RA Flare Definition Working Group includes an anchoring statement developed at OMERACT 9 in 2008: "flare in RA" is defined as worsening of signs and symptoms of sufficient intensity and duration to lead to a change in therapy. Subsequently, domains characterizing flare have been identified by comprehensive literature review, patient focus groups, and patient/HCP Delphi exercises. This led to a consensus regarding preliminary domains and a research agenda at OMERACT 10 in May 2010.

The conceptual framework of flare takes into account validated approaches to measurement in RA:

- **Disease activity indices**: Various disease activity indices such as Disease Activity Score, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Simplified Disease Activity Index.

- **Patient-reported outcomes (PRO)**: Use of patient-reported outcomes.

- **Clinically detectable differences**: Characterization of minimally clinically detectable and important differences (MCDD, MCID).

The measurement of RA flare consists of data collection assessing a range of unique domains describing key features of RA worsening at the time of patient self-report of flare, and then periodically for the duration of the flare. The components envisioned include:

- **Patient self-report**: Using a "patient global question".

### Rinvoq [^115WdRkJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: The efficacy and safety of Rinvoq 15 mg once daily were assessed in five Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria. Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible to participate. The presence of at least 6 tender and 6 swollen joints and evidence of systemic inflammation based on the elevation of hsCRP were required at baseline. Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dosage of Rinvoq is 15 mg once daily.

- **Trial RA-I (NCT02706873)**: This was a 24-week monotherapy trial in 947 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were naïve to methotrexate (MTX). Patients received Rinvoq 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg orally once daily, or MTX as monotherapy. At Week 26, non-responding patients on upadacitinib could be rescued with the addition of MTX, while patients on MTX could be rescued with the addition of blinded Rinvoq 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR50 response at Week 12. Key secondary endpoints included disease activity score (DAS28-CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12, DAS28-CRP < 2.6 at Week 24, change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24.

### Rna identification of PRIME cells predicting rheumatoid arthritis flares [^115VsixY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis, like many inflammatory diseases, is characterized by episodes of quiescence and exacerbation (flares). However, the molecular events leading to these flares are not well understood.

- **Methods**: We established a clinical and technical protocol for repeated home collection of blood in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to enable longitudinal RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Specimens were obtained from 364 time points during eight flares over a period of 4 years in our index patient, as well as from 235 time points during flares in three additional patients. Transcripts differentially expressed before flares were identified and compared with data from synovial single-cell RNA-seq. Flow cytometry and sorted-blood-cell RNA-seq in additional patients were employed to validate the findings.

- **Results**: Consistent changes were observed in blood transcriptional profiles 1 to 2 weeks before a rheumatoid arthritis flare. B-cell activation was followed by expansion of circulating CD45-CD31-PDPN+ preinflammatory mesenchymal, or PRIME, cells in the blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis; these cells shared features of inflammatory synovial fibroblasts. Levels of circulating PRIME cells decreased during flares in all 4 patients, and flow cytometry and sorted-cell RNA-seq confirmed the presence of PRIME cells in 19 additional patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Conclusions**: Longitudinal genomic analysis of rheumatoid arthritis flares revealed PRIME cells in the blood during the period before a flare. This suggests a model in which these cells become activated by B cells in.

### Investigating gout flares: beyond a definition [^117QkxRi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Gout flares are a paramount component of the disease burden inflicted by gout on the patient. They are included in the core domain set for long-term gout studies recognized by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology. Along with a validated classification criterion for gout, investigators have focused on defining and characterizing the gout flare. This brief review summarizes the efforts undertaken to define and characterize a gout flare in clinical studies.

Recent findings include a validated definition of a gout flare utilized in novel clinical studies, the use of technology to monitor for gout flares and their effects on patient life, and qualitative analyses of the disease burden that patients experience.

Although guidelines for core outcome domains are well established, questions remain about methods of measuring and reporting gout flares in long-term trials. Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the agreed-upon instruments' abilities to fully capture the disease burden experienced by gout patients. A combination of outcome measurements, including binary data (gout flare present or absent), along with a comprehensive measurement of disease burden over time, would theoretically provide a more accurate description of the disease and serve as a basis for intervention development.

### Identifying preliminary domains to detect and measure rheumatoid arthritis flares: Report of the OMERACT 10 RA flare workshop [^114MoS3w]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

While disease flares in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are a recognized aspect of the disease process, there is limited formative research to describe them.

- **Methods**: The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) RA Flare Definition Working Group is conducting an international research project to understand the specific characteristics and impact of episodic disease worsening, or "flare", so that outcome measures can be developed or modified to reflect this uncommonly measured but very real and sometimes disabling RA disease feature. Patient research partners provided critical insights into the multidimensional nature of flare. The perspectives of patients, healthcare, and research professionals are being integrated to ensure that any outcome measurement to detect flares fulfills the first OMERACT criteria of Truth. Through an iterative data-driven Delphi process, a preliminary list of key domains has been identified to evaluate flare.

- **Results**: At OMERACT 10, consensus was achieved identifying features of flare in addition to the existing core set for RA, including fatigue, stiffness, symptom persistence, systemic features, and participation. Patient self-report of flare was identified as a component of the research agenda needed to establish criterion validity for a flare definition; this can be used in prospective studies to further evaluate the Discrimination and Feasibility components of the OMERACT filter for a flare outcome measure.

- **Conclusion**: Our work at the time of writing has provided a better understanding of key aspects of the RA disease process.

### Characterizing nonarticular pain at early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis: Evolution over the first year of treatment and impact on remission in a prospective real-world early rheumatoid arthritis cohort [^111oJ2rz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Participants completed a body pain diagram (BPD) at baseline and at least one of the 6- or 12-month visits. They were given explicit instructions to record nonjoint pain on the BPD, for example, "Do you have pain in areas other than your joints?" If so, they were instructed to mark on the BPD where they had pain.

Patients were grouped by prespecified patterns of nonarticular pain (NAP) reported in four quadrants (right upper, right lower, left upper, and left lower) and axial sections as follows:

- **None**: No painful sections.
- **Regional NAP**: One to three painful sections (three sections if limited to one half of the body such as upper half, lower half, right half, or left half).
- **Widespread NAP**: Three to four painful sections (three sections if bilateral plus above and below the waist).

Prior work has defined widespread pain as having a minimum of three or four painful sections on the BPD. The maximum number of sections possible, based on our criteria, was four. Hands and feet were excluded from these definitions. It was found that patients with three painful sections had clinical features that aligned more closely with those with four sections than those with one to two sections, so they were included in the widespread NAP definition. To ensure more accurate classification, patients with three sections were split into two groups:

1. Participants whose NAP was more extensive, as defined above, were assigned to the widespread NAP group.
2. Participants who did not meet this more extensive criterion were assigned to the regional NAP group.

### Single-cell insights into immune dysregulation in rheumatoid arthritis flare versus drug-free remission [^113zVqbH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For many years, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was viewed as a disease of inexorable joint inflammation and destruction, with progressive and irreversible disability. However, the advent of modern disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), combined with the realization of the importance of early treatment and a treat-to-target escalation of therapy, has enabled a remarkable revolution in RA outcomes. Disease remission is now an achievable and realistic target for the majority of newly diagnosed patients.

With these incredible advances comes a new dilemma — how best to manage long-term DMARD therapy once remission has been achieved. Interventional clinical trials have shown that around half of patients with established RA in remission can stop conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) and achieve drug-free remission (DFR). However, even patients in sustained drug-induced remission can experience disease flares, which both risk incremental joint damage and limit physical function and quality of life.

DMARDs are potent drugs with potential toxicity, require expensive and labor-intensive safety monitoring, and can be viewed as a hindrance to an otherwise normal lifestyle by patients in remission. Strategies of DMARD minimization would thus reduce drug toxicity and improve quality of life, whilst simultaneously reducing treatment costs and utilization of healthcare resources. Reliable biomarkers of remission and flare, ideally measured within easily obtained samples such as peripheral blood, could help to inform such personalized approaches to DMARD therapy.
